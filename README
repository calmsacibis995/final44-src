This disk contains a snapshot of the /usr/src tree as it existed
on June 23, 1995, approximately one hour after the final 4.4BSD-Lite
Release 2 distribution from the Computer Systems Research group
was cut.  The project began using a source code control system (SCCS)
in 1980 (three years after Bill Joy began his initial Berkeley UNIX
development).  Initially only the kernel was put under SCCS, but
by 1983 everything had been put under SCCS.  The source code for
SCCS commands can be found in local/sccscmds.  Once built they can
be used to review the SCCS logs.

The list of contributors to the Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD) runs to hundreds of names.  For a complete list, see Contrib.

Three other disks are included in this series; two disks with the
various BSD distributions and one disk with historic AT&T and other
distributions.  Please note that all four disks contain AT&T
proprietary (both copyright and trade secret) files.  Therefore,
these disks may not be redistributed without permission or license
from AT&T or its successors.
