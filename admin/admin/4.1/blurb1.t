Dear Colleague:
.PP
We are happy to announce the availability of the Fourth Berkeley
Software Distribution (4BSD).  This
distribution is for VAX\(dg users with UNIX/32V\(dd
.FS
\(ddUNIX and UNIX/32V are trademarks of Bell Laboratories.
.FE

.FE
licenses and supersedes the
Third Berkeley Distribution made in January 1980.
The contents of this distribution are described in the two enclosed documents,
``Berkeley Software for UNIX on the VAX'' and ``Changes in the VAX
system for the Fourth Berkeley Distribution''.
.PP
This new distribution is being licensed by a liberalized licensing
agreement which eliminates paperwork for additional processors, provides for
sublicensing, and is intended to eliminate many potential difficulties
with the previous agreement.  A copy of the new agreement is enclosed as well
as a sheet explaining some special cases.
.PP
The Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at Berkeley has recently been funded
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop additional enhancements to the Berkeley version of UNIX.  It
is anticipated that any system developed for DARPA will be made
available using a mechanism similar to that used for 4BSD.
A short description of this project is enclosed.
.PP
The distribution consists of a magnetic tape plus printed documentation.
The magnetic tape contains copies of all binaries, source code,
and documentation.
The printed documentation contains a complete manual set including
both the Berkeley documentation and 
material which is unchanged from the original Western distribution.
In addition, a high-quality one-sided typeset duplication master
is provided for volume one of the UNIX Programmer's Manual and for the
sections of volume two which originate at Berkeley.
.PP
To receive the distribution, send two executed copies
of the license agreement, a
.I check
for $300 U.S. payable to the ``Regents of the University of California,''
a copy of your UNIX/32V license agreement, and a filled out copy of the
enclosed ``Configuration Description Form'' to
.DS

We will return a fully executed copy of the agreement to you with the
distribution.

If you have questions about the distribution or the licensing process, contact
Laura Tong at the above address, phone her at (415) 642-7780, or send mail
over the ARPANET to csrg@berkeley.
