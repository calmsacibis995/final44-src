be designated for no-cost licensing.  If you have been so designated,
send a note to that effect instead of a check.

If you are a part of the University of California, you should not
execute the license agreement.  Instead, send a letter indicating your
intention to abide by the terms of the license agreement.  The duplication
charge is not normally waived.

If you currently hold a 3BSD license you can obtain the 4BSD material under
the terms of your existing license by paying the $300.00 duplication fee.
If you later request a 4BSD license for the same material to obtain
its more liberal terms, we will apply this fee to the new license.
