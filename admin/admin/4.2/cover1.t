To set up the tapes, follow the instructions in the ``Setting up''
document in Volume 2C.
It is a good idea to look through the whole document before
you begin.
The ``Bug Fixes and Changes in 4.2BSD'' and ``4.2BSD System Manual''
documents in Volume 2C will also be useful in planning your conversion
to 4.2BSD.
If you have any questions that are not answered in the documentation supplied,
you can call us at (415) 642-7780.
.LP
Bug reports about this distribution can be submitted using the
sendbug program on the tape, which will submit a formatted report to
``4bsd-bugs@berkeley'' on the ARPANET, or to ``ucbvax!4bsd-bugs''
on the uucp network (you will have to figure out how to get to ucbvax
on the uucp net).  Ideas for improvement of the system should be sent
to ``4bsd-ideas'', in the same network context.
Please let us know of problems you have with the distribution tape.
If you bring up new devices or other software which you would be willing
to share with others, let us know.
