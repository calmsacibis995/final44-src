Dear Colleague:
.sp
.PP
Enclosed is the Information Packet for the 4.3BSD.  It is not possible
for us to enclose the Berkeley License Agreement (4/86)
as yet, since the problem with
the U.S. Export Administration Regulations is still pending.  These new
regulations require us to follow new procedures which are in the process of
being worked out before we are allowed to export our software.  
.sp 
.PP
As soon as this legal problem is resolved, you will receive the Berkeley
License Agreement. At that time we will look forward to receiving your request for
the 4.3BSD.

We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Thank you for your patience.
