Dear Colleague,

A revised version of the 4.3BSD distribution has commenced with
shipment number 0551. This note describes the revisions that were
made so that sites that received the earlier version can apply them to
their release.
.pp
Eight bugs in the kernel networking code were corrected. A brief
description of the problem that they correct and a context diff
of the fix is attached to this memo. On the new tape, the system
sources have been updated according to these reports and the kernel
has been recompiled and installed on both the mini-root and root 
file systems.
.pp
Two routines in the C library have been fixed. A brief description
of the problem that they correct and a context diff of the fix is
attached to this memo. On the new tape, /lib/libc.a and /usr/lib/libc_p.a
have had these two files updated. The affected binaries (/bin/passwd,
(and its hard links /bin/chsh and /bin/chfn), /etc/ftpd, /usr/ucb/netstat,
and /usr/ucb/systat) have been reloaded and installed.
.pp
The source for the uucp document (/usr/doc/smm/09.uucpimpl/implement.ms)
has been replaced with the rewritten version by Carl S. Gutekunst that
appears in the Usenix documentation and in documentation shipped with
the revised tapes. The diffs are too extensive to include in this memo,
but can be obtained from CSRG if needed.
.pp
The source for the gprof document (/usr/doc/misc/gprof) has added the
`pic' sources used to typeset the document shipped with the distribution.
The files are too extensive to include in this memo, but can be obtained
from CSRG if needed.
.pp
The Regents copyright notices have been removed from the following files
to which they were incorrectly added:
.(l
/usr/doc/smm/10.newsop/tmac.n
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/gcd.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/madd.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mdiv.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mout.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/msqrt.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/mult.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/pow.c
/usr/src/usr.lib/libmp/util.c

.pp
The C library tags file (/usr/lib/tags) has had incorrect lines
(starting with ``defined'') removed and the resulting file has been
sorted so that it will be in a format that will work with ``vi''.
