Dear Colleague:
.sp
.PP
We are happy to send you information about our June,
1990 test release of the Fourth
Berkeley Software Distribution, 4.3BSD-Reno.
This release represents an intermediate point in the development
of 4.4BSD; several new facilities have been completed and are ready
for external use, while other new facilities slated for the 4.4BSD
release have not yet been integrated.
Our goal in making this release available is to get feedback on any
problems in the design or implementation of the new facilities,
as well as to allow adventurous sites to gain experience with
these portions of 4.4BSD.
.PP
This distribution is NOT intended to be used on production systems;
nor is it intended for sites without sufficient local expertise
to find and fix any problems that are encountered.
It is intended to be used to provide an advance look at some of the
facilities and interfaces that we will be distributing in 4.4BSD.
We are interested in getting feedback on the problems that you find 
and also any compatibility problems that you anticipate in trying
to convert your applications to run on this release.
The interfaces in this release will change before the release
of 4.4BSD (at least in part based on feedback from this test group).
Thus, you should not expect applications ported to this release
to work unchanged on 4.4BSD.
.PP
Unlike past test releases, 4.3BSD-Reno is being made generally available
to 4.3BSD licensees,
and 4.3BSD-Reno may be redistributed and used in released products
(within the usual licensing constraints).
However, you will have to upgrade any code that you use from
4.3BSD-Reno to the 4.4BSD code within one year of the release of 4.4BSD.
We appreciate your help in this debugging effort and look
forward to hearing from you.
Please send your comments to reno43-bugs@okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU.
We regret that changes documents are not available;
the next section outlines the major changes available in 4.3BSD-Reno.
.PP
The license to 4.3BSD-Reno is simply an Addendum to the 4.3BSD License.
Sites without a 4.3BSD license may obtain both 4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-Reno
simultaneously, but must sign a 4.3BSD license as well as the Addendum.
Contact the distribution office for 4.3BSD licensing information.
4.3BSD is available only to sites
with UNIX/32V\(dg, System III, or System V
.FS
\(dgUNIX, UNIX/32V, UNIX System III, and UNIX System V
are registered trademarks of AT&T in the USA and other countries.
.FE
source licenses with AT&T.
We are actively working to decrease the amount of AT&T code in the system.
We expect that we will provide a subset of 4.4BSD without the AT&T
code to sites without requiring an AT&T license.
However, we are not prepared to make that determination for this release,
so we are providing only tapes with the complete system at this time.
.PP
The enclosed information is designed to serve two purposes.  The first
purpose is to acquaint you with the details of our distribution so you
can decide whether you would like to receive it.
The second purpose is to tell you how to obtain our distribution.
.SH
What is 4.3BSD-Reno?
.PP
The distribution consists of one 6250 bpi
or three 1600 bpi magnetic tapes containing full sources and documentation
plus one set of binaries.
You may specify VAX and/or Tahoe (CCI Power 6/32) binaries.
.\"On the three-tape 1600
.\"bpi set, parts of the user-contributed software are shipped
.\"as compressed archives to save space.
.PP
The three major new facilities available in the 4.3BSD-Reno
release are the addition of ISO/OSI networking support,
a freely redistributable implementation of NFS, and
the conversion to and addition of the POSIX.1 facilities.
There are numerous other changes throughout the system.
.PP
The ISO/OSI Networking consists of a kernel implementation of
transport class 4 (TP-4),
connectionless networking protocol (CLNP),
and 802.3-based link-level support (hardware-compatible with Ethernet*).
.FS
*Ethernet is a trademark of the Xerox Corporation.
.FE
The session and presentation layers will be provided outside
the kernel by the ISO development environment (ISODE).
Included in this development environment are file
transfer and management (FTAM), virtual terminals (VT),
a directory services implementation (X.500), and miscellaneous other utilities.
.PP
A new virtual filesystem interface has been added to the
kernel to support multiple filesystems.
Although generally similar to Sun's vnode interface,
the Berkeley interface has been structured for more efficient support
of filesystems that maintain state (such as the local filesystem).
In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'',
we have added an implementation of the network filesystem (NFS)
that fully interoperates with the NFS shipped by Sun and its licensees.
Because our NFS implementation was implemented using only the
publicly available NFS specification,
it does not require a license from Sun to use in source or binary form.
By default it runs over UDP to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
However, it can be configured on a per-mount basis to run over TCP.
Using TCP allows it to be used quickly and efficiently through
gateways and over long-haul networks.
We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory, which allows large temporary filesystems without
requiring dedicated physical memory.
.PP
The quota system has been rewritten to support both
user and group quotas (simultaneously if desired).
Quota expiration is based on time rather than
the previous metric of number of logins over quota.
This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.
.PP
The 4.3BSD-Reno distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified in the POSIX.1 system interface standard.
The biggest area of change is a new terminal driver.
The terminal driver is similar to the System V terminal driver
with the addition of the necessary extensions to get the
functionality previously available in the 4.3BSD terminal driver.
4.3BSD-Reno also adds the POSIX job control interface,
which is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but adds a security model that was missing in the
4.3BSD job control implementation.
Other additions include POSIX signals, FIFO's,
and saved user and group identifiers.
We have been tracking the POSIX shell and utility work
and have included prototypes of many of the proposed utilities.
Finally, we have converted about 80% of the libraries and header files
to be compliant with ANSI C.
.PP
Work has also progressed in several other areas.
Several important enhancements have been added to the TCP/IP
protocols including TCP header prediction and
serial line IP (SLIP) with header compression.
The routing implementation has been completely rewritten
to use a hierarchical routing tree with a mask per route
to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the ISO protocols.
The routing table also stores and caches route characteristics
to speed the adaptation of the throughput and congestion avoidance
algorithms.
.PP
The Kerberos (version 4) authentication software has been
integrated into much of the system (except NFS) to provide
the first real network authentication on BSD.
.PP
The hardware supported by 4.3BSD-Reno is:
.IP \(bu
VAX (86x0, 78x, 750, 730; MicroVAX II, 3200/3500/3600; 82x0)
.IP \(bu
Tahoe (CCI Power 6/32, 6/32SX; Unisys 7000/xx; Harris HCX7, HCX9)
.IP \(bu
HP 9000/300 series
.LP
In addition, kernel support for the Intel i386 and many AT-bus peripherals
has been added recently;
contact the distribution office for a list of supported hardware if necessary. 
.LP
For this distribution, binaries will be available for only the VAX
and Tahoe architectures.
The 4.4BSD distribution will probably be available for all the
above architectures as well as several machines based
on the MIPS processor.
.PP
The reason that this distribution is not labeled 4.4BSD-alpha
is because it does not contain several major interfaces that we 
plan to have available for that distribution.
These include:
.IP \(bu
A new virtual memory system using the \fImmap\fP
interface described in the 4.3BSD architecture document.
The interface is similar to the interface shipped
in several commercial versions of UNIX such as SunOS 4.0.
.IP \(bu
Support for ISO Connection-Oriented Network Service, X.25, TP-0.
.IP \(bu
A new internal network layering (``bstreams'') combining features
of the current socket layering and of Streams.
.IP \(bu
Fixes, tuning, fixes, documentation, and fixes.
.PP
This release does include several important structural kernel changes.
The most pervasive change is to eliminate the user structure fields
\fCu.u_error\fP, \fCu.u_u_r.r_val1\fP, and \fCu.u_ap\fP
by using a new internal system call convention:
.ft C
.nf
error = (*callp)(proc, args, retval);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
We are also reducing the use of other global variables
with the intent to eventually eliminate all references
to the user area except for the per-process runtime stack.
Thus, all substructures will eventually be referenced
via the proc structure.
.PP
Another major change is the introduction
of a new sleep interface:
.ft C
.nf
error = tsleep(wchan, pri|PCATCH, wstring, timeout);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptible sleeps.
The \fItsleep\fP interface can be used at any priority,
but is only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.
When interrupted, \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART;
all non-local goto's (longjmp's) have been eliminated from the kernel.
.PP
Many data structures that were previously statically allocated
are now allocated dynamically.
These structures include the mount table,
the vnode table, the name cache, and the quota structures.
.SH
How to obtain the 4.3BSD-Reno release
.PP
All previous 4.3BSD licensees will be able to receive
the 4.3BSD Reno release simply by executing the steps outlined below.
4.2BSD licensees who have not yet upgraded to 4.3BSD will be required
to do so as well as following the steps outlined below for the
Reno distribution.
For further information on ordering the standard 4.3BSD distribution,
contact our distribution office at the address given below.
.PP
Because we are a research and development organization and not a commercial
organization, we make our research results available for a fee
which covers only our costs for the distribution.
We distribute only the whole system
and cannot send individual pieces of the system.
Because the software is distributed ``As Is'' and is partially derived
from licensed material, we are required 
to have a formal license arrangement with each
organization to which we distribute. 
.PP
Specifically, we must receive from your organization the
following material before the distribution can be sent:
.IP \(bu
Two appropriate signed Addenda for the Reno distribution if you are a
4.3BSD licensee. Add to that the appropriate Addendum to
receive the upgrade if you are a 4.2BSD licensee.
For new licensees, two executed copies of the Berkeley License
Agreement (4/86) with the appropriate Addendum, i.e.,  for foreign
or US government sites, plus the Addendum for the Reno distribution.
We require two copies of all Agreements/Addenda with original
signatures, one of which is returned to the Licensee.
The name of the organization on the Addendum No. Three must be
the same as that which appears on the Software Agreement with
AT&T (or Western Electric). The Addendum No. Three must be signed
by a duly authorized person who holds a position that is at the
same level or a higher level of authority as that which appears
on the AT&T Software Agreement. Please have this person's name
and title typed in the available space in addition to the
signature.
.IP \(bu
A check from a U.S. bank for $495.00 U.S. (for a single 6250 BPI tape
of 4.3BSD-Reno)
or $595.00 (for three 1600 BPI tapes
of 4.3BSD-Reno) payable to 
``The Regents of the University of California''
must be received before the distribution can be sent.
If you must issue a Purchase Order, please issue one that is blank-backed.
If this is not possible, insert and initialize in the body of the Purchase
Order the following clause:
``The terms and conditions of this Purchase
Order are not accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The revised Berkeley License Agreement (4/86) governs.''
For 4.2 licensees that have updated to 4.3BSD, substitute
``The terms and conditions of this Purchase Order are not
accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The revised Berkeley License Agreement (6/83)
and Addendum Number Three govern.''
The wiring of money is strongly discouraged. If it must be wired, then 
along with the account number, the sender must
include "C.S.R.G.,2-7780".
.IP \(bu
A completed Site Information Form.
The distribution itself will be sent to the technical contact.
The site information is kept confidential
and is for our use in identifying sites with specific configurations.
Please note that we cannot ship to post office boxes; 
therefore, please have the
technical contact's address supplied without use of a post office box.
Please inform C.S.R.G. of any future changes in wither your
technical or administrative contacts.
.PP
All the above material must be sent to:
.DS
Distribution Coordinator
Computer Systems Research Group
Computer Science Division, EECS
University of California
Berkeley, California 94720
.DE
Once all these items have been received and are in proper order, the
distribution will be sent to the technical address indicated on the Site
Information Form that you provided when you placed your order;
we cannot provide delivery dates.
Once the material is assembled and packaged,
the distribution is shipped by commercial carrier.
Order of shipment will be based on time
of arrival of the properly completed paperwork.
Because of the differential in costs of shipping outside the United States,
we ask that organizations beyond the North American continent pay
the collect shipping charges.
The payment of custom and duty charges are the responsibility
of the recipient.
.PP
The most expedient way to insure that your full distribution is sent
as quickly as possible is to include in a single package the signed
appropriate Addenda (\fBwithout modification\fR)
for the Reno distribution plus any other
necessary signed legal papers, depending on your licensing status,
the appropriate check properly made out to 
``The Regents of the University of California,''
and a completely filled-out Site Information Form,
and to send this single package to the address noted above.
.SH
Large Organizations
.PP
Many large organizations have multiple entities that act independently
from one another and are licensed independently from AT&T.
Others have the parent organization licensed 
by AT&T and copies of the software distribution sent
to each independent entity. The Berkeley License Agreement must be
executed with the organization holding the appropriate AT&T Software Agreement.
.PP
If your organization has an AT&T license
and chooses not to redistribute internally,
please contact us for a copy of the letter of authorization
to be executed by the parent company.

.SH
Special Cases
.PP
\fBUniversity of California Sites\fR.
If you are a part of the University of California,
and do not already have an AT&T source license for your CPU,
you \fBmust\fP use the following procedure:
ask Pam True (415) 642-6348 at Berkeley Campus Materiel Management
for an application for an additional CPU 
authorization under The Regents of the University
of California's Software Agreement with AT&T.
We will receive the completed application from Materiel Management.
If you have previously obtained a Berkeley License for your CPU or
have an AT&T source license for your CPU, you do not need to contact
the Materiel Management Office.
.PP
In all cases, the following items must
be sent to the Computer Systems Research Group:
1) a letter signed by the Director or Head of 
Department requesting 4.3BSD-Reno,
stating that you have read and understood the Berkeley
License Agreement and that your organization will abide by it,
2) an IOC for $495.00 or $595.00 (1600 BPI), and
3) a Site Information Form if the contact information has changed.
.PP
\fBDARPA Sites\fR.
The research on which the Berkeley Software Distributions are based
has been sponsored by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).
Provision has been made for prepayment of distribution
costs for a few designated DARPA sites.
In place of the check for $495.00 or $595.00, you should include a letter
from your Program Manager stating that you are designated as such a site.
However, you \fBmust\fR comply with all
other requirements in applying for the distribution.
.SH
A Special Note 
.PP
The procedures and rules set out in this document are University
and AT&T constraints that must be followed in order for the
distribution of software to be possible.
The Computer Systems Research Group has no control
over these constraints and must reject your application
if material submitted is not in order.
