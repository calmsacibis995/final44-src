We are happy to send you information about our June,
E 2
1990 test release of the Fourth
D 2
Berkeley Software Distribution (4.3BSD-Reno).
Our goal in this release is to get feedback on any problems that
you have in installing or running the tape.
This distribution is NOT intended to be used on production systems.
It is intended to be used to provide an advance look at the
E 2
I 2
Berkeley Software Distribution, 4.3BSD-Reno.
This release represents an intermediate point in the development
of 4.4BSD; several new facilities have been completed and are ready
for external use, while other new facilities slated for the 4.4BSD
release have not yet been integrated.
Our goal in making this release available is to get feedback on any
problems in the design or implementation of the new facilities,
as well as to allow adventurous sites to gain experience with
these portions of 4.4BSD.
.PP
This distribution is NOT intended to be used on production systems;
nor is it intended for sites without sufficient local expertise
to find and fix any problems that are encountered.
It is intended to be used to provide an advance look at some of the
E 2
facilities and interfaces that we will be distributing in 4.4BSD.
We are interested in getting feedback on the problems that you find 
and also any compatibility problems that you anticipate in trying
to convert your applications to run on this release.
The interfaces in this release will change before the release
of 4.4BSD (at least in part based on feedback from this test group).
Thus, you should not expect applications ported to this release
to work unchanged on 4.4BSD.
D 2
You are reminded that you may use parts of 4.3BSD-Reno in
your released products.
E 2
I 2
.PP
Unlike past test releases, 4.3BSD-Reno is being made generally available
to 4.3BSD licensees,
and 4.3BSD-Reno may be redistributed and used in released products
D 3
(within the usual licensinge constraints).
E 3
I 3
(within the usual licensing constraints).
E 3
E 2
However, you will have to upgrade any code that you use from

We appreciate your help in this debugging effort and look
forward to hearing from you.

The license to 4.3BSD-Reno is simply an Addendum to the 4.3BSD License.
Sites without a 4.3BSD license may obtain both 4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-Reno
simultaneously, but must sign a 4.3BSD license as well as the Addendum.
Contact the distribution office for 4.3BSD licensing information.
4.3BSD is available only to sites

What is 4.3BSD-Reno?
.PP
The distribution consists of one 6250 bpi
D 2
or three 1600 bpi magnetic tapes.
You may specify either VAX or Tahoe binaries.
The magnetic tapes contain copies of all binaries,
source code, and documentation.  On the three-tape 1600
bpi set, parts of the user-contributed software are shipped
as compressed archives to save space.

E 2
.PP
The three major new facilities available in the 4.3BSD-Reno
release are the addition of ISO/OSI networking support,
a freely redistributable implementation of NFS, and
the conversion to and addition of the POSIX.1 facilities.
I 2
There are numerous other changes throughout the system.
E 2
.PP
The ISO/OSI Networking consists of a kernel implementation of
D 2
level four transport (TP-4),
E 2
I 2
transport class 4 (TP-4),

connectionless networking protocol (CLNP),

D 4
The session and presentation layers are provided outside
E 4
I 4
The session and presentation layers will be provided outside
E 4
the kernel by the ISO development environment (ISODE).
Included in this development environment are file
transfer and management (FTAM), virtual terminals (VT),
D 2
mail delivery (X.500), and miscellaneous other utilities.
E 2
I 2
a directory services implementation (X.500), and miscellaneous other utilities.
E 2
.PP
A new virtual filesystem interface has been added to the
kernel to support multiple filesystems.
D 2
In addition to the local fast filesystem,
E 2
I 2
Although generally similar to Sun's vnode interface,
the Berkeley interface has been structured for more efficient support
of filesystems that maintain state (such as the local filesystem).
In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'',
E 2
we have added an implementation of the network filesystem (NFS)
that fully interoperates with the NFS shipped by Sun and its licensees.
D 2
Because our NFS implementation was implemented only from the
E 2
I 2
Because our NFS implementation was implemented using only the
E 2
publicly available NFS specification,
it does not require a license from Sun to use in source or binary form.
By default it runs over UDP to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
However, it can be configured on a per-mount basis to run over TCP.
Using TCP allows it to be used quickly and efficiently through
gateways and over long-haul networks.
D 2
We have added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory which allows large filesystems without the
need to dedicate physical memory to it.
This filesystem supports a fast /tmp.
E 2
I 2
We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory, which allows large temporary filesystems without
requiring dedicated physical memory.
E 2
.PP
The quota system has been rewritten to support both
user and group quotas (simultaneously if desired).
Quota expiration is based on time rather than
the previous metric of number of logins over quota.
This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.
.PP
The 4.3BSD-Reno distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified in the POSIX.1 system interface standard.
The biggest area of change is a new terminal driver.
The terminal driver is similar to the System V terminal driver
with the addition of the necessary extensions to get the
functionality previously available in the 4.3BSD terminal driver.
D 2
4.3BSD-Reno also adds the POSIX job control interface
that is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but closes several glaring security holes in the
E 2
I 2
4.3BSD-Reno also adds the POSIX job control interface,
which is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but adds a security model that was missing in the
E 2
4.3BSD job control implementation.
Other additions include POSIX signals, FIFO's,
and saved user and group identifiers.
We have been tracking the POSIX shell and utility work
and have included prototypes of many of the proposed utilities.
D 2
Finally we have converted about 80% of the header files
E 2
I 2
Finally, we have converted about 80% of the libraries and header files
E 2
to be compliant with ANSI C.
.PP
Work has also progressed in several other areas.
Several important enhancements have been added to the TCP/IP
protocols including TCP header prediction and
serial line IP (SLIP) with header compression.
The routing implementation has been completely rewritten
to use a hierarchical routing tree with a mask per route
to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the ISO protocols.
The routing table also stores and caches route characteristics
to speed the adaptation of the throughput and congestion avoidance
algorithms.
.PP
The Kerberos (version 4) authentication software has been
integrated into much of the system (except NFS) to provide
the first real network authentication on BSD.
.PP
The hardware supported by 4.3BSD-Reno is:
.IP \(bu
VAX (86x0, 78x, 750, 730; MicroVAX II, 3200/3500/3600; 82x0)
.IP \(bu
Tahoe (CCI Power 6/32, 6/32SX; Unisys 7000/xx; Harris HCX7, HCX9)
.IP \(bu
HP 9000/300 series
D 2
.IP \(bu
(partially) i386 (AT-bus)
E 2
.LP
I 2
In addition, kernel support for the Intel i386 and many AT-bus peripherals
has been added recently;
contact the distribution office for a list of supported hardware if necessary. 
.LP
E 2
For this distribution, binaries will be available for only the VAX
and Tahoe architectures.
The 4.4BSD distribution will probably be available for all the
above architectures as well as several machines based
on the MIPS processor.

The reason that this distribution is not labelled 4.4BSD-alpha
E 4
I 4
The reason that this distribution is not labeled 4.4BSD-alpha
E 4
is because it does not contain several major interfaces that we 
plan to have available for that distribution.
These include:
.IP \(bu
A new virtual memory system using the \fImmap\fP
interface described in the 4.3BSD architecture document.
The interface is similar to the interface shipped
D 4
in several commercial version of UNIX such as SunOS 4.0.

This release does include several important structural kernel changes.
D 2
The most pervasive change is to eliminate
u.u_error, u.u_u_r.r_val1, and u.u_ap.
This change is done by using a
new internal system call convention:
.ft CB
E 2
I 2
The most pervasive change is to eliminate the user structure fields
\fCu.u_error\fP, \fCu.u_u_r.r_val1\fP, and \fCu.u_ap\fP
by using a new internal system call convention:
.ft C
E 2
.nf
error = (*callp)(proc, args, retval);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
We are also reducing the use of other global variables
D 2
with the intent being to eventually eliminate all references
to the user area except for the per-process runtime stack.

E 4
I 4
with the intent to eventually eliminate all references
to the user area except for the per-process runtime stack.
E 4
E 2
Thus, all substructures will eventually be referenced
via the proc structure.
.PP
Another major change is the introduction
of a new sleep interface:
D 2
.ft CB
E 2
I 2
.ft C
E 2
.nf
error = tsleep(wchan, pri|PCATCH, wstring, timeout);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
D 4
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptable sleeps.
E 4
I 4
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptible sleeps.
E 4
D 2
The tsleep interface can be used at any priority,
E 2
I 2
The \fItsleep\fP interface can be used at any priority,
E 2
D 4
but is only interruptable if the PCATCH flag is set.
D 2
When interrupted \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR;
E 2
I 2
When interrupted \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART;
E 4
I 4
but is only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.
When interrupted, \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART;
E 4
E 2
all non-local goto's (longjmp's) have been eliminated from the kernel.
.PP
Many data structures that were previously statically allocated
are now allocated dynamically.
These structures include the mount table,
the vnode table, the name cache, and the quota structures.

D 2
This section should be read by existing licensees as well as new licensees.
All previous 4.3BSD or 4.3BSD-Tahoe licensees will be required to sign
Addendum Number Three to the revised Berkeley License Agreement (6/83).
The fee for the 4.3BSD-Reno update is $495.00 if you are getting
a single 6250bpi tape.
Additional tapes cost $50.00;
thus a 1600bpi distribution costs $595.00
and a 6250bpi distribution for both the VAX and the Tahoe costs $445.00.
For new licensees, we require 
execution of the revised Berkeley License Agreement (4/86), 
in which reference to the inclusion of 4.3BSD has been incorporated.
The fee for release 4.3BSD for new licensees is $1,000.00.

the initial Berkeley License Agreement must be with the parent organization.
.RS
.IP a)
Because the Berkeley License Agreement references your parent organization's
AT&T Software Agreement without specification of CPU, the parent organization
may distribute 4.3BSD-Reno to entities within its organizations,
provided of course that each CPU is properly licensed with AT&T.
.IP b)
If your parent organization 
chooses not to redistribute internally, each entity
may receive 4.3BSD-Reno from the distribution group by forwarding a letter from
the parent organization to The Regents of the University of California
authorizing this entity to receive 4.3BSD-Reno.
The form of the authorization required is as follows:
.RS
.IP 
``I authorize (entity's name), a (division, company) of (organization's name),
to receive a copy of 4.3BSD-Reno under the terms and conditions of the revised
Berkeley License Agreement (4/86) for 4.3BSD 
between (organization's name) and The Regents of the University of California.
I warrant that (entity's name) will abide by said Agreement,
and that I have the authority to make this authorization on behalf of
(organization's name).
Please send a copy of 4.3BSD-Reno to
(designate name and address of organization/department).''

If your AT&T Software Agreement is with an individual entity

\fBGovernment Agencies and Government Contractors\fR.
.IP \(bu
The U.S. Government has a source Software Agreement with AT&T dated Sept. 1, 1975.
If you are a government agency operating under the 1975 Software Agreement,
you do not need a copy of the aforementioned Software Agreement;
you must send a copy of your additional CPU authorization from AT&T.
The Berkeley License Agreement for 4.3BSD should be signed by the 
Contracting Officer who signed the request for an additional CPU
authorization from AT&T.
.IP \(bu
Some government agencies have acquired their own AT&T Software
Agreement.  Here, we must obtain, as stated, a copy of this
Software Agreement with AT&T.  The Berkeley License Agreement must
be signed by the same officeholder (or replacement) whose
signature appears on the Software Agreement with AT&T.
The government agency shall be identified as the Licensee in 
the License Agreement of The Regents of the University of California.
.IP \(bu
If you are a contractor of the Government and have obtained an
additional CPU authorization from AT&T for your contract work,
the Berkeley License Agreement must be signed by the appropriate
Contracting Officer for the contract.
The contractor should address a letter
to the Contracting Officer stating that the contractor
agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of the Berkeley License Agreement
for 4.3BSD and ask that
the Contracting Officer sign the Berkeley License
Agreement for 4.3BSD-Reno. 
The Contracting Officer should then return the signed 
Berkeley License Agreement directly to the Computer Systems Research Group
with a cover
letter stating that the contractor is hereby authorized to receive a copy
of 4.3BSD-Reno.

\fBDARPA Sites\fR.
The research on which the Berkeley Software Distributions are based
has been sponsored by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).
Provision has been made for prepayment of distribution
costs for a few designated DARPA sites.
In place of the check for $495.00 or $595.00, you should include a letter
from your Program Manager stating that you are designated as such a site.
However, you \fBmust\fR comply with all
other requirements in applying for the distribution.
