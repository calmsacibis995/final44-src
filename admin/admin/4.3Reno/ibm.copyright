Dear Colleague,
.PP
A revised version of the 4.3BSD-Reno distribution has commenced with
the following shipment numbers.
For the VAX architecture, shipment number 23 at 6250 bpi, and shipment
number 8 at 1600 bpi.
For the Tahoe architecture, shipment number 1 at 6250 bpi, and shipment
number 2 at 1600 bpi.
This note describes the revision that was made so that sites receiving
an earlier version can apply it to their release.
System sources on newer tapes have already been updated.
