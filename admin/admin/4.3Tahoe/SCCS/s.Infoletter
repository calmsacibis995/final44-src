The distribution consists of one 6250 BPI or three 1600 BPI magnetic tapes,
D 3
and a copy of ``Installing and Operating on the Tahoe''.
E 3
I 3
certain updated manual pages,
and a copy of ``Installing and Operating 4.3BSD on the Tahoe.''

for both the VAX and the tahoe, and binaries for the tahoe.
E 3
On the three-tape 1600 BPI set,
parts of the user-contributed software are shipped
as compressed archives to save space.
.PP
The primary purpose of this release is to provide support
for the ``tahoe'' processor, the CPU used by
D 3
Computer Consoles Inc (Power 6/32, 632/SX),
and high end lines of Harris (HCX-7, HCX-9), Unisys (7000/40), and ICL.
Additional DEC equipment is supported including the 8250 BI-based CPU
and the QVSS and QDSS display drivers for the uVAX II.
New device support includes the DEC Delua and the Interlan NP100
ethernet controllers.

Support for this processor is derived from the 4.2BSD system
done by CCI.
Support for new DEC equipment has also been added,
including support for the 8250 BI-based CPU and the KDB-50 BI disk controller
from Chris Torek,
and the QVSS and QDSS display drivers for the MicroVAX II, contributed
by Digital Equipment Corporation.
We expect to provide support for both the VAX and the tahoe
processors in future releases.

I 2
The major new software systems include the following features:
E 2
.IP \(bu
D 3
The networking code has been extensively tuned to increase throughput
and reduce retransmissions.
The tuning is especially effective for slow, lossy, or congested networks.
E 3
I 3
The TCP and IP code is the same as that 
recently made available via the ARPANET and Usenet.
Several new algorithms are used in TCP,
in particular Van Jacobson's slow start and dynamic
window size selection algorithms and Phil Karn's modification
to the round-trip timing algorithm.
These changes increase throughput
and reduce congestion and retransmission.
Several fixes were made in the handling of IP options
and other gateway support.
E 3
.IP \(bu
The file system has been generalized to remove the limits on the
maximum number of inodes per cylinder group, cylinders per cylinder
group, and number of distinguished rotational positions.
D 3
The kernel and file system utilities fully operate on both
E 3
I 3
The kernel and file system utilities operate normally on both
E 3
new and old format file systems;
old kernels treat the new file systems as read-only.
I 3
This change allows better utilization of newer disks with larger numbers
of sectors per cylinder.
E 3
.IP \(bu
D 3
The system has full support for disk labels.
E 3
I 3
The system has full support for disk labels
that contain disk geometry information and partition layout on each disk.
Labels are used on disks using the
.B hp
or
.B uda
drivers on the VAX (hp or ra disks)
and all supported disks on the tahoe.
E 3
The utility to read and write disk labels can be used with
D 3
the system running multiuser.
E 3
I 3
the system running multiuser;
the labels are used and updated as appropriate by \fInewfs\fP, \fIbad144\fP,
the kernel and the bootstrap programs.
E 3
Basic file system parameters are stored in the label
D 3
so that ``fsck'' can compute alternate superblocks.
E 3
I 3
so that \fIfsck\fP can locate alternate superblocks.
The filesystem and \fInewfs\fP use additional information about
the disk geometry that is now available, such as track-to-track skew.

A new general purpose dynamic memory allocator has been written
E 3
I 3
A new general-purpose dynamic memory allocator has been written
E 3
that can be used by all the kernel subsystems.
The design of this allocator takes advantage of known memory usage
D 3
patterns in the UNIX kernel and a hybrid strategy that is time-efficient
E 3
I 3
patterns in the UNIX kernel, using a hybrid strategy that is time-efficient
E 3
for small allocations and space-efficient for large allocations.
D 3
This allocator replaces the multiple memory allocation interfaces
E 3
I 3
This allocator replaces most of the previous memory allocation interfaces
E 3
with a single easy-to-program interface,
results in more efficient use of global memory by eliminating
partitioned and specialized memory pools,
and is quick enough that no performance loss is observed
D 3
relative to the current implementations.
E 3
I 3
relative to the previous implementations.
E 3
Most of the kernel memory allocation is now done using this allocator.

The source code has been reorganized to ease support of multiple
machine types.

The Olson/Harris/Elz timezone implementation has been added to the
system.

How to obtain the 4.3BSD tahoe release
E 3
.PP
This section should be read by existing licensees as well as new licensees.
All previous 4.3BSD licensees will be able to receive
D 2
the 4.3BSD tahoe release without any additional licensing.
The fee for the 4.3BSD tahoe release is $400.00 for a 6250 BPI distribution
or $450.00 for a 1600 BPI distribution.
New licensees will first have to execute
the revised Berkeley License Agreement (4/86).
The fee for the 4.3BSD VAX distribution for new licensees is $1,000.00. 
The 4.3BSD tahoe distribution may be ordered at the same time.

following material before the distribution can be sent:
.IP \(bu
D 2
One signed and executed copy of the Berkeley License Agreement (for 4.3BSD)
or Addendum No. One (for 4.3BSD update) between
your company or institution and The Regents of the University of California.
E 2
I 2
Two appropriate signed Addenda for the tahoe distribution if you are a
4.3BSD licensee. Add to that the appropriate Addendum to
receive the upgrade if you are a 4.2BSD licensee.
For new licensees, two executed copies of the Berkeley License
Agreement (4/86) with the appropriate Addendum, i.e.,  for foreign
or US government sites, plus the Addendum for the tahoe distribution.
We require two copies of all Agreements/Addenda with original
signatures, one of which is returned to the Licensee.

.IP \(bu
A check from a U.S. bank for $400.00 U.S. (for a single 6250 BPI tape)
or $450.00 (for three 1600 BPI tapes) payable to 
``The Regents of the University of California''
must be received before the distribution can be sent.
If you must issue a Purchase Order, please issue one that is blank-backed.
If this is not possible, insert and initialize in the body of the Purchase
Order the following clause:
``The terms and conditions of this Purchase
Order are not accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The revised Berkeley License Agreement (4/86) governs.''
For 4.2 licensees that have updated to 4.3BSD, substitute
``The terms and conditions of this Purchase Order are not
accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The revised Berkeley License Agreement (6/83)
and Addendum Number One govern.''
