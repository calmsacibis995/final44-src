Dear Colleague:
.sp
.LP
Thank-you for ordering 4.4BSD!
.PP
The 4.4BSD distribution contains the ``User Reference Manual'' (URM),
the ``User Supplementary Documents'' (USD),
the ``Programmer Reference Manual'' (PRM),
the ``Programmer Supplementary Documents'' (PSD),
and the ``System Manager's Manual'' (SMM).
The distribution includes complete sources for the
Sun Microsystems SPARCstation, DEC 3100/5000, HP 9000/300, Omron Luna,
Sony NEWS, and 386/486-based PC architectures
and binaries for the one architecture that you have selected.
.PP
Before attempting to install your tape, you should carefully read
the document ``Installing and Operating 4.4BSD'';
it is the first document (after the manual pages) in the
``System Manager's Manual'' (SMM:1).
Unlike past releases, we have not provided a separate document
detailing the changes between 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD.
Instead, we have provided a summary of the changes in
section 3.5 of the ``Installing and Operating 4.4BSD'' document (SMM:1).
For a general overview of the system, you should read the
introduction at the beginning of the ``User Reference Manual'' (URM).
.PP
This distribution is intended to be used on production systems;
it has been run extensively at several test sites and has
proven to be stable and reliable.
However, because of the termination of the CSRG,
there will probably not be anyone available at Berkeley to assist
with technical problems,
so it should not be used by sites without enough local
expertise to find and fix any problems that are encountered.
If you have problems with the distribution itself or
encounter difficulties in reading the tape(s),
please contact Pauline Schwartz at +1-510-642-7780,
or via electronic mail at bsd-dist@CS.Berkeley.EDU.
Technical or installation questions may also be addressed to the
above electronic mail address, however,
we cannot ensure that technical support will be available.
.PP
We have attempted to make the system as compliant with the
POSIX 1003.1 and 1003.2 standards as was possible at the time
of its release.
We have not been able to run it through any of the
verification test suites, thus,
you should not claim conformance with either standard without
first validating the code.
.PP
If you redistribute or use code from this distribution in your own
products, please remember that due credit to the University is required
by the license agreement and the source code copyright notice.
