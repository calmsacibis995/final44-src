The 386BSD support will be available in February as part of a revision
of the 1989 Networking Release distribution.
One very important fact to remember is, that although the 386BSD itself
support is not AT&T proprietary, much of the rest of the operating system
and utilities ARE AT&T proprietary.
Therefore, the February distribution will NOT be a complete system and
cannot be booted or run on a 386 machine.
The distribution will not require an AT&T license, but will require a
Berkeley license and distribution fee.
Previous fees were approximately $500, but the actual fee has not yet
been determined.
.LP
The 4.4BSD release is scheduled for the middle of 1991, and additional,
non-proprietary support for the 386 will be made available at that time.
