Dear Steven:
.PP
This letter is to acknowledge your recent contribution of funding to
the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California,
Berkeley.
We very much appreciate your generosity, good wishes and support of
our group!
.PP
However, the monies that we received were insufficient to make a
difference in our funding situtation.
For that reason, we are returning your check to you.
.PP
Currently, our funding situation does not appear very good.
Several projects that I had hoped to finish before the final release
look like they will not be completed.
One way that you could help us deliver a more complete system would
be to encourage companies to purchase a copy of the 4.4BSD-Alpha
release, as that money will be directly used to help complete the
system.
.PP
Again, thank you for your contribution.
