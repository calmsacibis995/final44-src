This is a distribution tape for the 4.4BSD-Alpha release.
The package you received should have contained one 2400', 6250
BPI, 9-track magnetic tapes or one Exabyte 8mm cassette.
Both distribution tapes contain three files, however, the second and
third files on the 9-track distribution format are compressed
(see \fIcompress\fP(1)).
The three files are as follows:
.sp .5
.in 0.5i
.IP 1)
A \fIdump\fP(8) of the root file system.
.IP 2)
A tar format archive of the ``/usr'' file system.
.IP 3)
A tar format archive of the ``/usr/src'' file system.

The binaries and kernel on the tape support the Hewlett-Packard
9000/300 68000-based workstations, as detailed on the next page.
The dump does not contain a kernel, however, a compiled, generic kernel
is part of the third file, in ``/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC.hp300/vmunix''.
The tar format archives can be extracted into the current directory with
a command such as:
.sp .5
.ti 1i
tar  xpf  /dev/\fItapename\fP
.sp .5
.br
or, for the 9-track distribution format, with a command such as:
.sp .5
.ti 1i
dd  if=/dev/\fItapename\fP  bs=\fIbsize\fP  |  uncompress  |  tar  xf  -
.sp .5
.br
where \fIbsize\fP is the blocksize as follows:
.sp .5
.TS
