Dear 4.4BSD-Alpha Site:
.sp
.PP
We are happy to announce that we have completed 4.4BSD.
The purpose of this letter is to notify sites that purchased
the upgrade of 4.4BSD-Alpha to 4.4BSD that we are now ready to
ship you a 4.4BSD distribution.
.PP
This distribution is intended to be used on production systems;
it has been run extensively at several test sites and has
proven to be stable and reliable.
However, because of the shutdown of the CSRG,
there will not be anyone available at Berkeley to assist
with problems, so it should not be used by sites without enough local
expertise to find and fix any problems that are encountered.
.PP
The code in this distribution may be redistributed and used
in released products provided that you abide by the due credit
requirements listed in your license agreement.
We have attempted to make the system as compliant with the
POSIX 1003.1 and 1003.2 standards as was possible at the time
of its release.
We have not been able to run it through any of the
verification test suites, thus,
you should not claim conformance with either standard without
first validing the code.
.PP
The distribution is available on one 6250bpi 1/2'' 9-track tape
or one 8mm Exabyte cassette only.
The distribution contains complete source
as well as binaries for one of the following three architectures:
.IP \(bu
HP 9000/300 68000-based workstations.
.IP \(bu
DECstation 3100 and 5000 MIPS-based workstations.
.IP \(bu
Sparcstation I & II SPARC-based workstations.
(Note that the SPARC kernel will not run on the Sparcstation 10.)
.LP
You are entitled to a distribution with sources for all architectures
plus binaries for one of the above architectures.
If you wish to obtain binaries for more than one architecture,
they may be purchased at the same time for an additional $500 fee.
Please return the enclosed form indicating the architecture(s) that
you would like to receive.
If you would like more than one architecture,
please enclose a check for $500 per additional architecture.
.PP
We thank you for your early support for finishing 4.4BSD.
We hope that you will find it useful.
