Dear 4.4BSD SPARC Site:
.sp
.PP
We are happy to announce that we have a revised version
of 4.4BSD available for the SPARC processor.
We have completely rebuilt the SPARC binaries
from the 4.4BSD-Lite version of the sources.
The tape contains a complete set of binaries built from
a 4.4BSD-Encumbered system.
However, to make it easier to identify the encumbered sources from
the 4.4BSD-Lite sources,
all the encumbered sources have been moved into
a single directory \fB/usr/src/encumbered\fP.
Thus, you can distribute any sources outside that directory (and
none of the sources within that directory, except to USL licensed sites).
The kernel tree is completely unencumbered except for the
eight dirty files.
These eight files are in \fB/usr/src/encumbered/sys\fP
and are referenced out of the system sources by symbolic links.
Thus, you can safely create a `tar' archive of \fB/usr/src/sys\fP
without picking them up
(though of course it will not build or run without them).
.PP
As with the previous 4.4BSD SPARC distribution,
you need a SunOS system to build a root partition
and to create a \fB/boot\fP startup image.
The tape does contain the Sun contributed loader and X11R5
libraries so that it is possible to run X-windows without
any further compilation or additions.
An account with an example startup of the window system is provided.
.PP
The distribution is available on three 6250bpi 1/2'' 9-track tapes
or one 8mm Exabyte cassette only.
The revision to the original distribution is available
only for the SPARC architecture.
In addition to the hardware supported by the previous SPARC kernel,
the kernel on this distribution supports larger memories,
all known implementations of Sun's SCSI-disk controllers,
and the GX Graphics card (cgsix).
Note that the SPARC kernel still will not run on
machines with a reference MMU
(such as the Sparcstation 5 or 10).
.PP
This tape is being made available only to those licensed for 4.4BSD-Encumbered.
If you would like order one of these distributions,
please return the enclosed order form and a check
for $500.00 for an 8mm Exabyte distribution
or $600.00 for a 6250bpi 9-track distribution.
