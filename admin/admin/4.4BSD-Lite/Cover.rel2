Dear Colleague:
.sp
.PP
We are delighted to send you information about
our February 1995 distribution of 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2.
This second release of 4.4BSD-Lite includes the copy editing work done
for the Usenix/O'Reilly manuals as well as numerous bug fixes and
enhancements that have been accumulated in the year since the
release of 4.4BSD-Lite.
Of particular interest are the changes needed to port the system
to 64-bit architectures,
important security enhancements to TCP/IP,
and much improved functionality for the
union and log-structured filesystems.
This tape was put together by emeritus members of the Computer
Systems Research Group;
their time was paid for by the excess of revenue
over expenses from the sales of 4.4BSD-Lite.
.PP
The 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 software is
copyrighted by the University of California
and others, but may be freely redistributed without fee.
It is available to anyone and requires no previous license
from AT&T, Novell/USL, or The Regents of the University of California.
The distribution includes both software developed at Berkeley
and much software contributed by authors outside Berkeley.
The code in this distribution may be redistributed and used
in released products without fee, if the due credit,
copyright notice, and other requirements
described in the license and the source files are met.
.PP
This packet is intended to serve two purposes.
The first is to acquaint you with the details of our distribution
so you may decide if you wish to purchase it.
The second is to inform you how to obtain our distribution.
.SH
Distribution contents
.PP
.B "The distribution is a source distribution only,"
.B "and does not contain program binaries for any architecture."
It will not be possible to compile or run this software
without a pre-existing system that is already installed and running.
In addition, the distribution does not include sources for a complete system.
It includes source code and manual pages for the C library,
approximately 90% of the utilities distributed as part of 4.4BSD,
and most of the kernel (the same subsystems that were deleted in Net/2
are still missing in 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 \(em support for executing files,
doing physical I/O, managing the buffer cache,
handling process tracing, terminal character I/O, and doing accounting).
Because the Computer Systems Research Group has shut down
(other than a brief reunion to put together this release),
there will not be anyone available at Berkeley to assist with problems,
so sites are encouraged to ensure enough local expertise to
find and fix any problems that are encountered.
.PP
We have attempted to make the system as compliant with the ANSI C and
IEEE POSIX 1003.1 and 1003.2 standards as was possible at the time
of its release.
We have not run it through any of the verification test suites, thus,
you should not claim conformance with either standard without
first validating the code.
.PP
This software distribution is only available on two 6250bpi 1/2''
9-track tapes or one 8mm Exabyte cassette.
A complete set of the Usenix/O'Reilly 4.4BSD manuals will
accompany your distribution media.
The 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 distribution contains source
for the following architectures:
.IP \(bu
HP 9000/300 68000-based workstations,
.IP \(bu
DECstation 3100 and 5000 MIPS-based workstations,
.IP \(bu
Sparcstation I & II SPARC-based workstations
(Please note that the distribution does
.B not
support the Sparcstation 10.),
.IP \(bu
Sony News MIPS-based workstations,
.IP \(bu
Omron Luna 68000-based workstations,
.IP \(bu
Intel 386/486-based machines (ISA/AT or EISA bus only).
.LP
The distribution does
.B not
include the machine support for the Tahoe and VAX architectures
found in previous BSD distributions.
Our primary development environment is the HP9000/300 series machines.
The other architectures are developed and supported by
people outside the university.
Consequently, we are not able to directly test or maintain these 
other architectures, so cannot comment on their robustness,
reliability, or completeness.
More specifically, the support for the x86 architectures is known to
be unstable.
.SH
How to obtain 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2
.PP
To obtain 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2,
we require execution of the Berkeley License Agreement (3/95).
In addition, foreign licensees must execute Addendum Number One for 
Foreign Licensees in ordering 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2.
The fee is $1000.00 for 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2.
.PP
Because we are a research and development organization
and not a commercial organization,
we make our research results available for a small license fee.
We distribute only the whole system ``As Is''
and cannot send individual pieces of the system.
We are required by the University of California to have
a formal license arrangement with each
organization to which we distribute. 
.PP
Specifically, for 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2,
we must receive from your organization the
following material before the distribution can be sent:
.IP \(bu
\fBTwo\fR original signed and executed copies of
the Berkeley License Agreement (3/95) for 4.4BSD-Lite between your company
or institution and The Regents of the University of California
along with Exhibit A properly filled out.
For Foreign licensees, there is an Addendum to
the License Agreement that must also be executed.
Please have this person's name and title 
.B 
typed 
.R
in the available space in addition to the signature.
One signed copy of the Berkeley License Agreement will be
returned to you after it has been executed by
The Regents of the University of California.
.IP \(bu
A check from a U.S. bank for $1000.00 must be received before
the distribution can be sent.
Checks should be made payable to 
``The Regents of the University of California,
Computer Systems Research Group.'' 
If you must issue a Purchase Order,
together with your prepayment, 
please issue one that is blank-backed.
If this is not possible,
insert and initial in the body of the Purchase Order the following clause:
``The terms and conditions of this Purchase Order
are not accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The revised Berkeley License Agreement (3/95) prevails.''
Wire transfers are strongly discouraged.
.IP \(bu
The attached Site Information Form completely filled out.
Your copy of the signed 4.4BSD-Lite License Agreement
will be sent to the person listed as the administrative contact.
The distribution itself will be sent to the technical contact.
All information is kept confidential;
it is for our use in notifying you of important bug fixes.
Please note that we cannot ship to post office boxes;
therefore, please have the technical contact's address
supplied without use of a post office box.
.LP
A checklist is included to aid you in assembling this material.
All the above material must be sent to:
.DS
Pauline Schwartz, Distribution Coordinator
Computer Systems Research Group
Computer Science Division, EECS
317 Soda Hall
University of California
Berkeley, California 94720-1776
.DE
Once all these items have been received and are in proper order,
the distribution will be sent to the technical address listed on the
Site Information Form.
We cannot provide delivery dates.
Once the material is assembled and packaged,
the distribution is shipped by commercial carrier.
Order of shipment will be based on time
of arrival of the properly completed paperwork.
Because of the differential in costs of shipping outside the United States,
we ask that organizations outside the continental United States
pay the collect shipping charges.
If the destination is one where collect shipment
cannot be made by the carrier,
then advance payment of the shipping charges will be required.
.PP
The most expedient way to ensure that your full distribution
is sent as quickly as possible is to include in a single
package two original copies of the appropriate
Berkeley License Agreement completed
and properly signed (\fBwithout change\fR),
the appropriate check properly made out to 
``The Regents of the University of California,
Computer Systems Research Group'' and a completely filled out
Site Information Form and to send this single package
to the address noted above.
.PP
Please note that if you modify the Berkeley License Agreement,
you may experience a delay of three months or more before 
receiving an acceptance or denial of the changes.
We reserve the right to cancel your application if we have
not received the requested paperwork within 60 days
from the date it was sent to us.
.SH
Special Cases
.PP
\fBUniversity of California Sites\fR.
If you are a part of the University of California,
the following items must be sent to the Computer Systems Research Group:
1) a letter of authorization signed by the Director or Head of Department 
requesting 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2,
stating that you have read and understood the Berkeley
License Agreement (3/95) and that your organization
will abide by it;
2) an IOC for $1,000.00; and
3) a Site Information Form.
.SH
A Special Note 
.PP
The procedures and rules set out in this document
are University constraints that must be followed
for the distribution of software to be possible.
The Computer Systems Research Group has no control over
these constraints and must reject your application if
material submitted is not in order.
If you have questions about the licensing process after reading
this letter, you may call Pauline Schwartz at (510) 642-7780,
write to her, or contact her via electronic mail at pauline@cs.berkeley.edu.
