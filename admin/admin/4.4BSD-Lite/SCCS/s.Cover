D 2
We are happy to send you information about our April 1994
release of 4.4BSD-Lite.
The University and Novell/USL (formerly UNIX System Laboratories)

The settlement agreement allows the university to release
4.4BSD-Lite under terms that are similar to those of the second BSD
Networking Release (Net/2).

The major new facilities available in the 4.4BSD-Lite release are
a new virtual memory system, 
the addition of ISO/OSI networking support,
a new virtual filesystem interface supporting filesystem stacking,
a freely redistributable implementation of NFS,
a log-structured filesystem,
enhancement of the local filesystems to support
D 3

of the process resources shareable by multiple processes.
The system and include files have been converted to be compatible

There are numerous other changes throughout the system.
.PP
The new virtual memory implementation is derived from the MACH
D 2
operating system developed at Carnegie-Mellon,
E 2
I 2
operating system developed at Carnegie-Mellon University,
E 2
and was ported to the BSD kernel at the University of Utah.
The MACH virtual memory system call interface has been replaced with the
``mmap''-based interface described in the ``Berkeley Software
D 2
Architecture Manual'' (see UNIX Programmer's Manual, 
E 2
I 2
Architecture Manual'' (see the UNIX Programmer's Manual, 
E 2
Supplementary Documents, PSD:5).
The interface is similar to the interfaces shipped
by several commercial vendors such as Sun, Novell/USL,
D 2
and Convex Computer Corp.
E 2
I 2
and Convex Computer Corp., and as described by POSIX 1003.4.
E 2
The integration of the new virtual memory is functionally complete,
but still has serious performance problems under heavy memory load.
The internal kernel interfaces have not yet been completed
and the memory pool and buffer cache have not been merged.
.PP
The ISO/OSI Networking consists of a kernel implementation of
transport class 4 (TP-4),
connectionless networking protocol (CLNP),
and 802.3-based link-level support (hardware-compatible with Ethernet*).
.FS
*Ethernet is a trademark of the Xerox Corporation.
.FE
We also include support for ISO Connection-Oriented Network Service,
X.25, TP-0.
The session and presentation layers are provided outside
the kernel by the ISO development environment (ISODE).
Included in this development environment are file
transfer and management (FTAM), virtual terminals (VT),
D 2
a directory services implementation (X.500), and miscellaneous other utilities.

.PP
A new virtual filesystem interface has been added to the
kernel to support multiple filesystems.
In comparison with other interfaces,
the Berkeley interface has been structured for more efficient support
of filesystems that maintain state (such as the local filesystem).
The interface has been extended with support for stackable
filesystems done at UCLA.
These extensions allow for filesystems to be layered on top of each
other and allow new vnode operations to be added without requiring
changes to existing filesystem implementations.
.PP
In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'',
we have added an implementation of the network filesystem (NFS)
that fully interoperates with the NFS shipped by Sun and its licensees.
Because our NFS implementation was implemented using only the
publicly available NFS specification,
it does not require a license from Sun to use in source or binary form.
By default it runs over UDP to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
However, it can be configured on a per-mount basis to run over TCP.
Using TCP allows it to be used quickly and efficiently through
gateways and over long-haul networks.
Using an extended protocol, it supports Leases to allow a limited
callback mechanism that greatly reduces the network traffic necessary
to maintain cache consistency between the server and its clients.
.PP
A new log-structured filesystem has been added that provides
near disk-speed output and fast crash recovery.
It is still experimental in the 4.4BSD-Lite release,
so we do not recommend it for production use.
We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory, allowing large temporary filesystems without
requiring dedicated physical memory.
.PP
The local ``fast filesystem'' has been enhanced to do 
clustering which allows large pieces of files to be
allocated contiguously resulting in near doubling
of filesystem throughput.
The filesystem interface has been extended to allow
D 3
files and filesystems to grow to 2^63 bytes in size.
E 3
I 3
files and filesystems to grow to #2 sup 63# bytes in size.
E 3
The quota system has been rewritten to support both
user and group quotas (simultaneously if desired).
Quota expiration is based on time rather than
the previous metric of number of logins over quota.
This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.
.PP
The system security has been greatly enhanced by the
addition of additional file flags that permit a file to be
marked as immutable or append only.
Once set, these flags can only be cleared by the super-user
when the system is running single user.
To protect against indiscriminate reading or writing of kernel
memory, all writing and most reading of kernel data structures
must be done using a new ``sysctl'' interface.
D 5
The information to be access is described through an extensible

.PP
The 4.4BSD-Lite distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified in the IEEE Std1003.1 system interface standard.
The biggest area of change is a new terminal driver.
D 5
The terminal driver is similar to the System V terminal driver
E 5
I 5
The terminal driver meets the POSIX interface
E 5
with the addition of the necessary extensions to get the
functionality previously available in the 4.3BSD terminal driver.
4.4BSD-Lite also adds the IEEE Std1003.1 job control interface,
which is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but adds a security model that was missing in the
4.3BSD job control implementation.
Other additions include IEEE Std1003.1 signals, FIFOs,
byte-range file locking, and saved user and group identifiers.
.PP
There are several new tools and utilities included in this release.
A new version of make allows much-simplified makefiles for the system software
and allows compilation for multiple architectures from the same source tree
(which may be mounted read-only).
Notable additions to the libraries include functions to traverse a
filesystem hierarchy, database interfaces to btree and hashing functions,
D 2
a new, fast implementation of stdio and a radix sort function.
E 2
I 2
a new, fast implementation of stdio and radix and merge sort functions.
E 2
The additions to the utility suite include greatly enhanced versions of
D 2
programs that display system status information, implementations of
E 2
I 2
programs that display system status information, new implementations of
E 2
various traditional tools described in the IEEE Std1003.2 standard,
and many others.
.PP
We have been tracking the IEEE Std1003.2 shell and utility work
and have included prototypes of many of the proposed utilities.
Because most of the traditional utilities have been replaced
with implementations conformant to the POSIX standards,
you should realize that the utility software may not be as stable,
reliable or well documented as in traditional Berkeley releases.
In particular, almost the entire manual suite has been rewritten to
reflect the POSIX defined interfaces, and in some instances
it does not correctly reflect the current state of the software.
It is also worth noting that, in rewriting this software, we have generally
been rewarded with significant performance improvements.
Most of the libraries and header files have been converted
to be compliant with ANSI C.
The default compiler (gcc) is a superset of ANSI C,
but supports traditional C as a command-line option.
The system libraries and utilities all compile
with either ANSI or traditional C.
.PP
Work has also progressed in several other areas.
Several important enhancements have been added to the TCP/IP
protocols including TCP header prediction and
serial line IP (SLIP) with header compression.
Ethernet multicast support is now available.
The routing implementation has been completely rewritten
to use a hierarchical routing tree with a mask per route
to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the ISO protocols.
The routing table also stores and caches route characteristics
to speed the adaptation of the throughput and congestion avoidance
algorithms.
.PP
The Kerberos (version 4) authentication software has been
integrated into much of the system (including NFS) to provide
the first real network authentication on BSD.
.PP
This release includes several important structural kernel changes.
The kernel uses a new internal system call convention;
the use of global (``u-dot'') variables for parameters and error returns
has been eliminated,
and interrupted system calls no longer abort using non-local goto's (longjmp's).
A new sleep interface separates signal handling from scheduling priority,
returning characteristic errors to abort or restart the current system call.
This sleep call also passes a string describing the process state,
which is used by the ps(1) program.
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptible sleeps.
The sleep interface (\fItsleep\fP) can be used at any priority,
but is only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.
When interrupted, \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART.
.PP
Many data structures that were previously statically allocated
are now allocated dynamically.
These structures include mount entries, file entries,
user open file descriptors, the process entries, the vnode table,
the name cache, and the quota structures.
