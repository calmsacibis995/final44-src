Your distribution includes a single set of 4.4BSD manuals.
D 2
Rather than typesetting the manuals ourselves,
we have arranged to use the manuals being produced by O'Reilley.
E 2
I 2
Rather than printing the manuals ourselves,
we have arranged to use the manuals being produced by O'Reilly
and Associates.
E 2
Because of the delay between the release of the tape
and the publication of the manuals, we do not expect to
have manuals to ship until late June.
Rather than hold up your distribution,
we have shipped your tape now and will follow it up with
D 2
a copy of the manuals when they are available.
If you would prefer a photocopy of the 4.4BSD manuals
that is available now instead of a copy of the O'Reilley
manuals later, contact us at the address below,
and we will arrange to ship it to you.
E 2
I 2
a set of the manuals as soon as they are available.
If you would prefer the immediately available, unbound, photocopy
of the 4.4BSD manuals instead of a set of the O'Reilly manuals
later, contact us at the address below, and we will arrange to ship
one to you.
