Here is the proposed `statement' to be made by a university official:

Dr. Chang-Lin Tien, Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley,

its leading role of providing UNIX technology transfer to industry.
By providing wide distribution of 4.4BSD-Lite with minimal restrictions
on its use, the University will continue to be the focal point for both
software research in and commercial development of truly open systems.''
