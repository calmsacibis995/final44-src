Dear Colleague:
.sp
.PP
We are delighted, at long last, to send you your copy of the
4.4BSD-Lite distribution.
.PP
The 4.4BSD-Lite software is copyrighted by the University of California
and others, but may be freely redistributed without fee.
Recipients of this tape need not have a previous license with AT&T,
Novell/USL, or The Regents of the University of California.
The distribution includes both software developed at Berkeley
and much software contributed by authors outside Berkeley.
The code in this distribution may be redistributed and used
in released products without fee, if the due credit,
copyright notice, sublicensing, and other requirements
described in the license and the source files are met.
.PP
.B "This distribution is a source distribution only,"
.B "and does not contain program binaries for any architecture."
You have received either a single Exabyte tape, or two 6250,
9-track tapes.
The Exabyte tape contains a single \fBtar\fP(1) image of
the distribution with a ``20b'' blocking factor.
The 9-track distribution contains a single \fBtar\fP(1)
archive on each tape, each with a ``20b'' blocking factor.
The first tape of this 9-track distribution
contains everything on the distribution
except \fI4.4BSD-Lite/usr/src/contrib\fP;
the second tape of this 9-track distribution
contains \fI4.4BSD-Lite/usr/src/contrib\fP.
Both tapes contain paths starting from 4.4BSD-Lite,
and may be extracted in any order.
.PP
Your distribution includes a single set of 4.4BSD manuals.
Rather than printing the manuals ourselves,
we have arranged to use the manuals being produced by O'Reilly
and Associates.
Because of the delay between the release of the tape
and the publication of the manuals, we do not expect to
have manuals to ship until late June.
Rather than hold up your distribution,
we have shipped your tape now and will follow it up with
a set of the manuals as soon as they are available.
If you would prefer the immediately available, unbound, photocopy
of the 4.4BSD manuals instead of a set of the O'Reilly manuals
later, contact us at the address below, and we will arrange to ship
one to you.
.PP
If you have questions about your distribution or have difficulty
in reading your distribution tape,
you may call Pauline Schwartz at +1-510-642-7780, write to her,
or contact the distribution office at bsd-dist@cs.berkeley.edu.
