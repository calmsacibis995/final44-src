We are planning to implement prototypes for each of these
outlined areas of work over the period of this proposal.
.LP
1.  We will do an informal (``alpha'') release of the system
to interested developers after the first quarter of the proposal period.
In particular, the informal release will be made available
to the group at Mt Xinu that is producing a commercially
supported MACH release, as well as to collaborators on the OSI networking
project.
The alpha release will include
.IP "   \(bu
a shadow password facility that makes password guessing much more difficult
.IP "   \(bu
a network authentication system integrated into the standard system login
and network servers
.IP "   \(bu
network protocols and applications that conform to the forthcoming
Internet Host Requirements specification
.LP
2.  In addition to the informal tape-based release,
much of the networking software can be made publically available
via the Internet.
The shadow password facility and the revised network protocols and
servers will be made available in this way as they are completed.
.LP
3.  After incorporating feedback and refinements from the testers,
another release will be made to interested parties
at the end of the proposal period.
This release will be a stable system that may be used by other researchers,
although it may be known as a ``beta'' or intermediate release.
Any problems identified in the first release will be corrected
in the second release.
Ancillary network servers such as the printing and mailing systems
will be converted to use the new authentication scheme for the second
release.
.LP
4.  We will submit a technical report
describing the work done under this proposal.
