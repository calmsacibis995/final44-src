.PP
This is a proposal for DARPA support of operating system
and networking research in the UNIX project at UC Berkeley.
The goal of the project is to use leading edge research ideas
in a stable and reliable implementation that solves current problems in
operating systems research.
The resulting system is widely used by other researchers in operating systems
and network protocols and implementations.

The network and authentication subsystems are the bases
for the TCP/IP and login authentication systems of most networked UNIX systems.
I 2
This project will augment the current weak authentication scheme
with a true network authentication services.
Remote login, process execution and local network services will
be modified to use this service in such a way that the user interface
will remain as it is, allowing use of network services without entering
passwords at each use.
User's passwords will no longer be passed through the network,
even in encrypted form.
E 2
The improvements that this project will make in those subsystems will be
applicable to most research and commercial versions of UNIX.
