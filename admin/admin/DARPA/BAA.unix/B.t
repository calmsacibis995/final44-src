\fB\s+4B. Summary of Innovation\fP\s-4
.PP
This is a proposal for DARPA support of operating system
and networking research in the UNIX project at UC Berkeley.
The goal of the project is to use leading edge research ideas
in a stable and reliable implementation that solves current problems in
operating systems research.
The project also includes incorporation of network protocols and other
subsystems into the operating system while maintaining consistency
with the existing system call interface.
The resulting system is widely used by other researchers in operating systems
and network protocols and implementations.
.PP
The work in this proposal includes integration of an implementation
of the ISO OSI networking protocols into the existing socket interface
and internal network architecture, which has not yet been done in
a satisfactory manner.
The proposal also includes an IEEE POSIX-standard operating system
interface integrated with the existing system interface
in such a way that both interfaces are fully supported and interoperate
fully.
The networking and filesystem interfaces will be extended to allow
greater flexibility and performance.
Both interfaces draw upon previous work, incorporating the best features
of several previous designs.
These new interfaces improve upon previous work
with better support for caching in layered architectures.
We expect that the products of this work
will become the interfaces and implementations
of choice for other operating systems and networking researchers
in the near future.
