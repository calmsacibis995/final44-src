We expect that we will have working prototypes early in 1989.

We expect that we will have working prototypes
of the OSI protocols, the POSIX interface and the filesystem interface
early in 1989.

E 2
When the prototypes are moderately stable and functional,
we will produce a test release that we will distribute to
our alpha sites for testing and feedback.
I 2
The test release is scheduled for the end of the first quarter
of the proposal period.

Work on the networking interface will be completed during the second and third
quarters of the proposal period,
along with addition of OSI connection-oriented network protocols
and completion of the POSIX interface.

If major design flaws turn up during the alpha testing,
we will reenter the development phase to resolve the problems
resulting in another test release.
Otherwise, we will incorporate feedback from the testing
and produce a revised distribution by the end of the period
covered by this proposal.
