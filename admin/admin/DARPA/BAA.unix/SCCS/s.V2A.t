Keith Sklower will be made available to work on the ISO Networking
part of the project from the Computer Systems Support Group (CSSG),
which provides hardware and software
services to the department on a recharge basis.
Professor Richard Newton of EECS ably directs CSSG, and has been

budgetary controls, and work scheduling.
The existence of CSSG has enabled the department to benefit from a
pooled collection of spare parts, from shared maintenance
arrangements, and from the flexibility to move staff around as needed.
CSSG also provides senior staff supervision of hardware and 
software technicians employed by a particular project or research
group, if requested.
The faculty sets direction and policy in all cases.
