Dear Dr. Limb,
.PP
I am writing to you in my role as the head of operating
system and networking research for the \s-1UNIX\s0 project in the Computer
Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley, known as
the Computer Systems Research Group (\s-1CSRG\s0).
In the past year funding for our group has been provided by
Hewlett-Packard, the Open Software Foundation (\s-1OSF\s0),
and Cray Research.
As the period of that funding has drawn to a close,
we are hopeful that you will renew your support for the coming year
so that we can continue our work at the university.
A gift on the order of $150,000 would provide roughly
a quarter of the budget needed by \s-1CSRG\s0
for salaries and benefits, maintenance and network access fees,
travel and other expenses.
.PP
We are very excited by the new HP700 ``Snake'' workstations.
In the coming year, we plan to work with the people in the systems
group at the University of Utah to get Berkeley UNIX fully supported
on that platform.
We hope to leverage off their 4.3BSD port to bring 4.4BSD to the Snake.
.PP
To support the 4.4BSD development on the HP700 platform
we anticipate the need for six machines consisting of
two HP720's, three HP730's, and one HP750.
The machines will be configured with various peripherals
and grayscale and color (but not graphics) interfaces to
ensure that we can support all the models in the product line.
We are asking for an equipment grant of $200,000 to purchase
these machines.
