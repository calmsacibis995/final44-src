-- Our sublicensees would not have the right to use, modify, and/or reproduce
   the software.

-- All proprietary rigths cannot stay with MIPS.

-- The current proprietary notices are unacceptable:

	Copyright Unpublished, MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.  All Rights
	Reserved.  This software contains proprietary and confidential
	information of MIPS and its suppliers.  Use, disclosure or
	reproduction is prohibited without the prior express written
	consent of MIPS.

-- typo, page 2, "EPXRESS"

-- Confidential Information clause doesn't make sense.  MIPS is placing
   this code, effectively, into the public domain.  There's no reason
   to restrict our ability to disclose it.

-- We need portions of the C library, and MIPS R2000 support.

The specific software to be licensed to Berkeley for
       redistribution   is  still  unclear.   The  specific
       exceptions listed on Exhibit A of the Agreement  are
       not  sufficiently  clear.  Although MIPS has donated
       an M/120 system to Berkeley for this work,  and  has
       discussed  inclusion  of  support  for the M/120 and
       M/2000 systems, there is no mention of this  in  the
       current   agreements.    The  R/6000  CPU  has  been
       announced in the meantime,  and  Berkeley  would  be
       interested  in  the addition of support for that CPU
       and systems based on it.
