Dear Dr. Woodward,
.PP
This letter and accompanying report consitute our final report
on NASA grant NAG 2-763, covering the period of
February 1, 1992 through January 31, 1993.
.PP
We have just recently released 4.4BSD.
The attached report is a letter sent to our past licensees
describing this distribution.
.PP
During this period we had hoped to complete the final distribution
of 4.4BSD-Lite (an unencumbered version of the distribution). 
We had also hoped to prototype some of the real-time interfaces
envisioned by the POSIX 1003.4 working group.
Unfortunately, the lawsuit by UNIX Systems Laboratories
against the University required much time from our staff
preventing us from completing many of our technical goals.
The University has also voluntarily decided not to ship 4.4BSD-Lite
until the lawsuit is resolved.
So, although the tape is ready to ship,
we cannot predict when it will be released.
Your support in the past year was instrumental in our being able
to finish 4.4BSD and has been much appreciated.
