we have a well defined procedure for fixing the problem and 
expeditiously disseminating the fix to the BSD mailing list.
This procedure has proven itself to be effective in
solving known problems as they arise
(witness its success in handling the recent worm).
However, we feel that it would be useful to take a more active
role in identifying problems before they are reported (or exploited).

We are proposing that a complete audit be made of the system
utilities to find unintended system access mechanisms.

As a part of the work to make the system more resistant to attack
from local users or via the network, it will be necessary to produce
additional documentation on the configuration and operation of the system.
This documentation will cover such topics as file and directory ownership
and access, network and server configuration,
and control of privileged operations such as file system backups.

A group within the Internet Engineering Task Force has been drafting
a Host Requirements standard for Internet hosts.
We reviewed this draft recently and joined the working group.
For the most part, the existing Berkeley TCP/IP and networking application
software conforms with the draft.

We propose to review conformance with the Host Requirements standard

A major shortcoming of the present system is that authentication
D 3
over the network is based solely on the privileged port mechanism.

I 3
over the network is based solely on the privileged port mechanism

such processes are easy for a workstation user to obtain;

they simply reboot their workstation single user.

Thus, a real authentication mechanism is needed.
At present, we believe that the MIT Kerberos authentication
server provides the best solution to this problem.

authentication mechanisms and then integrating

MIT currently supports the use of Kerberos for authentication
of rlogin, rsh, certain other servers used at MIT, and the NFS mount
protocol.

We propose to add support for telnet (eventually replacing rlogin),

If we choose Kerberos,
we will add support for telnet (eventually replacing rlogin),
E 5
the X window system, and the mail system within an authentication
domain (a Kerberos \fIrealm\fP).
I 5
We would also need to add support for transparent third-party operations.
(The existing Kerberos software allows a user to connect to a server
on another system without supplying a password,
but does not allow processes started on the server to access the network
without sending another password over the network.)
We hope to replace the existing password authentication on each host
with the network authentication system.

The new authentication mechanism would then be fully integrated
with the system and utilities in future Berkeley software releases.
