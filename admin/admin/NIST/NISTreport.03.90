Berkeley continues to  participate in the POSIX Standardization effort
that most recently involved attending the January POSIX meeting.
We attended the February IETF meeting and have been collaborating
with the gated and SNMP developers for more efficient interfaces
for obtaining network management information.
.pp
We are revising the routing code to permit link-level access for ISO IS-IS.
We are preparing a proposal for an addition to the IS-IS protocol
for allowing summaries at the LAN level for level 1 routers.
.pp
We have submitted revised ESIS code to NIST for testing,
which we believe fixes problems reported earlier.
We have been pursuing other reported bugs in ISO ESIS code,
though we have been unable to replicate problems reported by NIST.
.pp
We have incorporated the code from MITRE that contends with
the congestion-experienced bit.
We corrected another protocol error reported by NIST
about initial credit allocations.
We have responded to another reported bug about transmission
of user-confirm-data.
.pp
We are continuing our development of X.25 support for CLNP and CONS.
The development emphasizes graceful co-existence with IP over public
data networks and the DDN.
The implementation should work over a variety of drivers
(including front-end processors), and with the possibility of multiple
X.25 interface boards on a given machine.
.pp
We have received evaluations of the COS tests for the TP4/CLNP
implementation and have begun reviewing them.
.pp
We have begun to test recent revisions to the routing layer
that permit link-level access for ISO IS-IS, and have revised the
code that does CLNP over IP encapsulation.
.pp
We have made the latest BSD system run on the VAX,
which includes support for NFS.
.pp
In collaboration with the Open Software Foundation,
we participated in Sun Microsystems Connectathon
that brought together more than eighty NFS vendors
to test interoperability.
Only one bug was discovered in our NFS implementation.
.pp
We structurally reorganized the kernel to reduce the
number of global variables (important for security
considerations) and formalized several major interfaces
to improve modularity.
.pp
We are bringing most projects to a close in preparation
for making a distribution by the end of the next quarter.
This will allow a coherent starting point for those
groups that wish to continue this work when this project
is terminated at the end of June.
