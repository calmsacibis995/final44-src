\fB\s+2DASH Project\s0\fP
.pp
The DASH project was not funded by this grant during the period of
this report.
The funds were applied to a no-cost extension for the Berkeley UNIX Project
during the period April to June 1989.

.pp
During this period, Berkeley continued to participate in the IEEE
P1003 standards committees (Posix), and the IETF OSI working group.
.pp
We revised the Wisconsin transport level code so that it was possible
explicitly negotiate connection requests,
being able to send confirmation or rejections
(with user supplied data),
rather than having them automatically
confirmed in the kernel (as TCP does).
.pp
We tested the code against itself over a single ethernet,
and found it stable enough to sustain transport level
connections among different machine types
(a microvax and CCI machine; the latter having opposite
native byte order from the VAX).
We shipped this version to colleagues
at NIST for review and testing during this period.
.pp
We began collaborating with Marshall Rose to integrate support for the
4.4 socket interface in ISODE.
.pp
The virtual file system interface is now running on our development
machine.
Rick Macklem's NFS implementation has been integrated and will
be ready for testing in the next quarter.
.pp
POSIX saved process and group identifiers have been implemented.
Several small problems were encountered in the specification and have
been forwarded to the POSIX group working on the revisions to P1003.1.
We anticipate that our revisions will be incorporated.
