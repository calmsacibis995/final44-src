During this period we completed the interface between ISODE and
the 4.4BSD socket interface and subjected it to testing over a
local ethernet.  We included changes for P1003.1 compliance
in the tty specific parts of the Virtual Terminal applications.
.pp
We assisted in the constructions of an SNMP agent for monitoring
OSI parameters in addition to TCP parameters.
.pp
Bugs were discovered and fixed concerning proper encoding of moderate
sized packets over 802.2/3, and a performance problem resulting
from ``silly window syndrome'' between the Kernel socket layer,
and the Wisconsin transport provider was identified.
.pp
We released copies of this version of the software to Dec,
HP, Cray, NIST, Wisconsin, & Mitre for further study and testing.
.pp
Berkeley continued to participate in the IEEE
P1003 standards committees (Posix), and the IETF OSI working group.
.pp
The implementation of NFS was completed and put into limited use in our
development environment.
Rick Macklem spent the last half of August at Berkeley working
on NFS performance with CSRG.
.pp
The POSIX signal interface was implemented and deployed on our
development machine.
