\fB\s+2DASH Project\s0\fP
.pp
Since September, 1988 the main research direction of the DASH project
has been integrated multimedia network communication
(i.e., the ability to redirect streams of digital audio/video
between I/O devices, processes, hosts, and permanent storage).
To this end, we designed an IPC abstraction called "channels" which
(unlike datagrams and virtual circuits) has performance,
reliability, and security parameters.
This has spawned three research efforts:
1) the design of a protocol hierarchy that uses channel parameters
to eliminate or optimize protocol functions such as flow control,
checksumming and encryption;
2) the design of an OS kernel that uses channel parameters to optimally
schedule local resources such as CPU time, buffers space, and network
transmission order;
3) the design of algorithms for implementing channels
(channel establishment and packet switching) in large networks.
.pp
The implementation of the DASH kernel has progressed significantly.
The major kernel components (virtual memory, network communication,
multiprocessor deadline scheduling) are now working.
The DASH kernel was ported to the Sequent Symmetry this fall.

.pp
During this period of time we finished implementing and testing a routing
table lookup algorithm suggested by Van Jacobsen which may greatly speed
up any system acting as a packet switch for CLNP packets.
.pp
We redesigned, implemented and tested a new interface for communicating
routing information between a user level process and the kernel, by
means of a special type of message based socket.
.pp
The results of the
additional performance experiments done by
Van Jacobson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
and several additional performance improvements 
reported in the last quarter have been
merged into the Berkeley TCP.
.pp
We are continuing our participation in the IEEE P1003 standardization
efforts for portable operating systems, with particular attention to
networking.
We are continuing to convert the Berkeley UNIX system
to comply with the P1003.1 (POSIX) standard.
The POSIX terminal interface and job control mechanism are now
fully operational, and are in daily use on our development system.
