Dear Dr. Goldstein,
.PP
We have completed the test distribution of our current system,
named 4.3BSD-Reno, that we are making available to all of our
licensees.
This is the distribution that we agreed to make available
for use in OSF-1.
Please let me know to whom we should send the tape to ensure
that OSF's copy can be sent as soon as possible.
.PP
As OSF has contributed both financially and technically to
the BSD effort, we would like to provide the tape at no
cost to you.
We appreciate both your and OSF's contributions in making
this distribution possible!
