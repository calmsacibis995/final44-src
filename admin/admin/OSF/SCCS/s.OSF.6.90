Dear Dr. Goldstein,

We have prepared a test distribution of our current system
called 4.3BSD-Reno that we are distributing to all our test sites.
This is the distribution that we promised to make available
for use in OSF-1 in our agreement with you.
Please let me know to whom we should send the tape so that
I can ensure that OSF's copy gets sent as soon as possible.

We have completed the test distribution of our current system,
named 4.3BSD-Reno, that we are making available to all of our
licensees.
This is the distribution that we agreed to make available
for use in OSF-1.
Please let me know to whom we should send the tape to ensure
that OSF's copy can be sent as soon as possible.
.PP
As OSF has contributed both financially and technically to
the BSD effort, we would like to provide the tape at no
cost to you.
We appreciate both your and OSF's contributions in making
this distribution possible!
