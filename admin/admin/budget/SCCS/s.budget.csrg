Notes:
The programmer II position was previously held by Kevin Fall
who was laid off due to a shortage of funds. If the funds
become available again Kevin or an equivalent will be hired
in that position to work on security related issues.

The low per trip cost of travel is due to ceilings on such
costs imposed by the US government.

The equipment budget used to contain entries for five more
Sun workstations and attendent servers and disks. These were
deleted in anticipation of the HP workstations. The remaining
items are for upgrades of our existing environment.

The costs for university overhead have been deleted. These
would amount to a 48% surcharge on everything except equipment.
