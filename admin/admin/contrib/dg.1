Dear Mr. Bostic:

Enclosed you will find operating software programs, designed for the
Data General Aviion 300 Computer Systems, for inclusion in
Berkeley Software Distributions.
We own and
have title to this material and we have the authority to convey it to
you for inclusion in Berkeley Software Distributions.  However, certain
elements of the software are for your internal use only and NOT for
re-distribution.  For the sake of clarity we have specified (see
Attachment "A") the specific programs for inclusion in BSD releases
and those that are specifically excluded.  We understand that you may
wish to modify this material before distribution, and have no objection
to your so doing.
.pp
It is understood that the term "inclusion" referred to in the above paragraph
means that The Regents have the right to distribute the material to whomever
it deems appropriate, provided that legal obligations to AT&T are met prior
to such distribution.  We understand that the terms and conditions of the
license under which the Berkeley Software Distribution are made available
may be modified at any time by The Regents of the University of California.
.pp
It is further understood that licensees of Berkeley Software Distributions
have the right to sublicense Berkeley Software Distributions, with or without
modifications they may wish to make, provided that their legal obligations
to AT&T are met.
.pp
We also understand that you will attempt to ensure that the enclosed material
is distributed with the same provision regarding proper credit that is used
for material originating at the University of California; however, the
enclosed material is sent to you with no obligation that you, The Regents
of the University of California, or any employees of The Regents actually
ensure proper credit or provide any other specific protection for this
material.
.pp
We do not intend by forwarding this material to you to enter into a
contractual relationship; rather, we are providing this material for use
in the Berkeley Software Distribution in order to make a contribution to
the community of UNIX users.
.pp
Parts of this material are based on proprietary material of AT&T which
we obtained under the terms of our System V Release XX license.  We are
conveying it to you with the understanding that you will treat those
parts as if you received them directly from AT&T pursuant to your
license for that proprietary material.
