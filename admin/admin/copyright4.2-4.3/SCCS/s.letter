This letter outlines the steps that we proposed

This letter outlines the steps that we have taken
E 2
D 3
to establish the Regent's copyright on the parts of the Fourth Berkeley
E 3
I 3
to establish the Regents' copyright on the parts of the Fourth Berkeley
E 3
Software Distribution (4.2BSD and 4.3BSD) that are derived from work
done at the University of California, Berkeley.
D 2
Briefly, we plan to insert copyright notices into each of the separate

I 2
Briefly, we have inserted copyright notices into each of the separate
E 2
D 3
source files for original Berkeley work and major Berkeley additions.
E 3
I 3
source files which contain original Berkeley work and major Berkeley additions.
E 3
D 2
This will be done in such a way
that the copyright notice will be included in the executable programs
E 2
I 2
The notices were inserted so
that the copyright notice is included in the executable programs
E 2
when they are compiled from the copyrighted source.
D 2
We will also place a copyright notice on the label of each tape
shipped with the distribution, and examine the copyright notices in the
printed documentation for completeness.
The next release of the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution, 4.3BSD,
will include all of these changes.
E 2
I 2
The copyright notices in the
printed documentation were also verified for completeness.
A copyright notice is put on the label of each tape
shipped with the distribution.
These changes were all completed in time for the
4.3BSD release of the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution.
E 2

D 2
In order to reclaim the copyright on the material which was distributed
without copyright notices in 4.2BSD, we will send a letter, a draft
of which is attached, to all of the existing licensees of 4.2BSD
and to AT & T.
This letter will require each licensee to insert the copyright notices
in existing copies of the licensed material, and to similarly notify
anyone to whom they have licensed 4.2BSD sources.
I have not specifically addressed the question of binary-only
redistributions of 4.2BSD, which would not include most of the
files requiring modification.
Alternatively, licensees of 4.2BSD may replace their existing
licensed material with the 4.3BSD versions.
.pp
The copyright notices will be placed in each source file that was
E 2

The copyright notices have been placed in each source file that was
E 2
originally written at Berkeley, or which was rewritten or substantially
D 2
modified at Berkeley such that the majority of the program was of

In addition, programs which have been modified to the extent that
D 2
their function is significantly improved will also be marked
E 2
I 2
their function is significantly improved have been marked
E 2
with the University copyright.
D 2
This distinction is different than the 90% derivation that we discussed,
E 2
I 2
D 3
This distinction requires somewhat less change than the 90% derivation
that we discussed,
E 2
but I believe it to be reasonable for those few programs that it covers.
E 3
I 3
In the latter case, although there may be somewhat less than the 90%
Berkeley derivation we discussed,
I believe it to be reasonable for those few programs that it covers.
E 3
Other programs that have not been modified,
or have been less substantially modified at Berkeley,
D 2
will not be marked as copyrighted.
E 2

have not been marked as copyrighted.

Programs received from sources other than 32/V or University work

The copyright notices to be inserted are of the form
E 2
I 2
The copyright notices that have been inserted are of two forms.
The first form is for programs that still contain AT&T proprietary
code and thus require an AT&T license as well as a Berkeley license:

This will be surrounded by delimiters so that it will be ignored
by the programs which need to read the file.
For those programs which originated with 4.2BSD rather than 4.1BSD
or before, the copyright date will be 1983.

The second is for programs that do not contain any AT&T code,

and thus require only that due credit be given to the University:

The above notice is the one used throughout the 4.3BSD.
The second, which appears immediately below, is for programs that do not 
contain AT&T code,

We are now preparing
to reclaim the copyright on the material that was distributed
without copyright notices in 4.2BSD.
We intend to send a letter, a draft
D 3
of which is attached, to all the existing licensees of 4.2BSD and to AT&T.
E 3
I 3
of which is attached, to all the existing licensees of 4.2BSD.
E 3
This letter will require each licensee to insert the copyright notices
in existing copies of the licensed material, and to similarly notify
anyone to whom they have licensed 4.2BSD sources.
To simplify the procedure,
D 3
we will not distinguish between the files to contain the
Berkeley-only copyright and the AT&T restricted copyright;
E 3
I 3
we will not annotate the list of files to indicate which of the two copyright
notices should be used; 
E 3
instead we will instruct them to put the more restrictive
D 3
copyright requiring an AT&T license in all the listed files.
E 3
I 3
D 4
copyright requiring an AT&T license (appearing above as the first) 
E 4
I 4
copyright requiring an AT&T license (appearing first above)
E 4
in all the listed files.
E 3
D 5
I have not specifically addressed the question of binary-only
redistributions of 4.2BSD, which would not include most of the
files requiring modification.
E 5
.pp
Alternatively, licensees of 4.2BSD may replace their existing
licensed material with the 4.3BSD versions.
We expect that most 4.2BSD sites will choose the approach of upgrading.
