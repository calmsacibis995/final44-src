Dear Mary:

This letter outlines the steps that we have taken
to establish the Regents' copyright on the parts of the Fourth Berkeley
Software Distribution (4.2BSD and 4.3BSD) that are derived from work
done at the University of California, Berkeley.
Briefly, we have inserted copyright notices into each of the separate
source files which contain original Berkeley work and major Berkeley additions.
The notices were inserted so
that the copyright notice is included in the executable programs
when they are compiled from the copyrighted source.
The copyright notices in the
printed documentation were also verified for completeness.
A copyright notice is put on the label of each tape
shipped with the distribution.
These changes were all completed in time for the
4.3BSD release of the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution.
.pp
The copyright notices have been placed in each source file that was
originally written at Berkeley, or which was rewritten or substantially
modified at Berkeley such that the majority of the program is of
Berkeley origin.
In addition, programs which have been modified to the extent that
their function is significantly improved have been marked
with the University copyright.
In the latter case, although there may be somewhat less than the 90%
Berkeley derivation we discussed,
I believe it to be reasonable for those few programs that it covers.
Other programs that have not been modified,
or have been less substantially modified at Berkeley,
have not been marked as copyrighted.
Some programs received as user contributed software from sources other
than 32/V or University work have been marked with copyrights
agreed to by the contributor.
.pp
The copyright notices that have been inserted are of two forms.
The first form is for programs that still contain AT&T proprietary
code and thus require an AT&T license as well as a Berkeley license:
.nf
.in+1i
.sp
Copyright (c) 1983 Regents of the University of California.
All rights reserved.  The Berkeley software License Agreement
specifies the terms and conditions for redistribution.
.sp
.in -1i
.fi
The above notice is the one used throughout the 4.3BSD.
The second, which appears immediately below, is for programs that do not 
contain AT&T code, 
and have already been inserted into the tahoe release. 
.nf
.in+1i
.sp
Copyright (c) 1983 Regents of the University of California.
All rights reserved.
.sp
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms are permitted
provided that this notice is preserved and that due credit is given

.sp
.in -1i
.fi
If time permits, this notice will be amended to incorporate your
modifications as follows:
.nf 
.in+1i
.sp
Copyright (c) 1988 The Regents of the University of California.
All rights reserved.
.sp
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms are permitted
provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are
duplicated in all such forms and that any documentation, advertising
materials, and other materials related to such redistribution and
use acknowledge that the software was developed by the University
of California, Berkeley. The name of the University may not be used
to endorse or promote products derived from this software without
specific prior written permission. THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED

.fi
These notices are surrounded by delimiters so that they are ignored
by the programs that need to read the file.
For those programs that originated with 4.2BSD rather than 4.1BSD
or before, the copyright date is 1983.
In the source files comprising a single program,
one notice of the form
.nf
.in +1i
.sp
char copyright[] =
"@(#) Copyright (c) 1983 The Regents of the University of California.\en\e
 All rights reserved.\en";
.sp
.in -1i
.fi
has also been included.
The part of the notice between quotes is included
in the executable binary program after compilation,
and is displayed when checking the version of the program.
.br
.ne 2i
.pp
A list of the files to be copyrighted is attached as Appendix A.
.pp
We are now preparing
to reclaim the copyright on the material that was distributed
without copyright notices in 4.2BSD.
We intend to send a letter, a draft
of which is attached, to all the existing licensees of 4.2BSD.
This letter will require each licensee to insert the copyright notices
in existing copies of the licensed material, and to similarly notify
anyone to whom they have licensed 4.2BSD sources.
To simplify the procedure,
we will not annotate the list of files to indicate which of the two copyright
notices should be used; 
instead we will instruct them to put the more restrictive
copyright requiring an AT&T license (appearing first above)
in all the listed files.
.pp
Alternatively, licensees of 4.2BSD may replace their existing
licensed material with the 4.3BSD versions.
We expect that most 4.2BSD sites will choose the approach of upgrading.
