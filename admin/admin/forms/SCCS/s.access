Agreement for Access to the Berkeley Software Distribution Sources
E 6


D 6
I understand that I am being given access to Western Electric Company's
proprietary UNIX software to assist with the development of, and for
the review of, Berkeley UNIX.  I have been notified that any disclosure
to me of this software is made in confidence and that I am obligated to
keep it in confidence.  I understand that this obligation shall survive
and continue after my access terminates, but that this obligation shall
not extend to any information or technical data which is now available
to the general public or which becomes available to the general public
by acts not attributable to the University of California, its employees,
or students.
E 6
I 6
I understand that any accounts on source machines at Berkeley that
are made available to me are to be used only to assist in the
development of, and for the review of, the Berkeley Software
Distribution. I will not copy any source or documentation from a
Berkeley machine to any other machine without the explicit written
or electronic approval of a CSRG staff member.  I will delete any
source which I have copied once I am no longer reviewing or developing
the Berkeley Software Distribution.  I will not make any source or
documentation from the Berkeley Software Distribution available to
anyone else without the explicit written or electronic approval of
a CSRG staff member, unless it has been released as part of an
official distribution made by the University of California.
