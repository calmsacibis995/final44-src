Agreement for Access to the Berkeley Software Distribution Sources


I understand that any accounts on source machines at Berkeley that
are made available to me are to be used only to assist in the
development of, and for the review of, the Berkeley Software
Distribution. I will not copy any source or documentation from a
Berkeley machine to any other machine without the explicit written
or electronic approval of a CSRG staff member.  I will delete any
source which I have copied once I am no longer reviewing or developing
the Berkeley Software Distribution.  I will not make any source or
documentation from the Berkeley Software Distribution available to
anyone else without the explicit written or electronic approval of
a CSRG staff member, unless it has been released as part of an
official distribution made by the University of California.
