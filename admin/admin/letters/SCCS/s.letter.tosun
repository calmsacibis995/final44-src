Dear Mr. Choy,
.PP
I have discussed the issues raised in your letter of April 16, 1990

system and networking research for the \s-1UNIX\s0 project in the Computer
Science Division of the University of California, Berkeley, known as
the Computer Systems Research Group (\s-1CSRG\s0).
Dr. McKusick informs me that he has been personally involved in

coordinating the development of \s-1NFS\s0 for \s-1BSD\s0.

The group is well aware of the issues of code contamination,
as they have had to deal with it for years.
Further, their high profile makes it additionally important that
they have strict procedures for code development and detailed
documentation of all outside sources of code.
.PP
The implementation of NFS that has been incorporated in \s-1BSD\s0
was developed by Rick Macklem at the University of Guelph near
Toronto, Canada.
\s-1CSRG\s0 has on file a contributed software agreement from the
University of Guelph stating that the implementation of \s-1NFS\s0
that Guelph has made available to \s-1CSRG\s0 contains no proprietary
code of any company.
The code was developed entirely from the specifications that were
placed in the public-domain by Sun.
As a further assurance that none of Sun's proprietary code was
incorporated into the contributed \s-1NFS\s0 implementation,
Rick Macklem has told us that the University of Guelph does not
have a Sun source license.
.PP
If I can be of any further assistance in clarifying these issues,
please feel free to contact me.
D 2
If you would like to get a current copy of our \s-1NFS\s0 code,
we can work out a method to make it available to you.
