Judy, my name is Keith Bostic, and I work for the University of
California, at Berkeley.
We spoke at the recent POSIX meeting, in Florida, about Berkeley's
concerns regarding restrictions that IEEE may place on the inclusion
of portions of the POSIX standards in vendor documentation.
.pp
At that time you requested that I send you a letter describing our
proposed usage and including an example.
.pp
Our usage is as follows: we (and all UNIX vendors) provide both on-line
and hardcopy documentation of the user-level commands supplied with
the system.
POSIX 1003.2 will be standardizing a small subset of these commands.
When vendors become conformant, they will be faced with two types
of changes.
Some POSIX commands may be created from current commands and
documentation, by adding new flags, or modifying current behaviors,
while others will have to be written from scratch.
As this standard is, in many ways, a rigorous specification of the
current UNIX manual pages, it will be a much simpler task to become
conformant if vendors can use portions of the standard to create
their usual style of documentation.
This style is in no way intended to replace the standard itself,
and my guess is that no more than twenty percent of the overall
standard would be reproduced.
.pp
The example that I've included is the ``cat'' command.
This is probably a fairly reasonable example, and indicative of the
percentage of text that Berkeley would take from the POSIX standard.
We would, however, wish to draw more heavily on the POSIX descriptions
for commands that are new to the system, or commands with a complex
syntax, such as ``sh'', or ``awk''.
.pp
There are two major advantages to the user community in allowing vendors
to draw from the POSIX standard.
First, the manual pages are much more likely to be error-free if they are
taken from the exhaustively checked standard.
This is not a trivial point; if nothing else, the creation of the POSIX
standard has proven the difficulty of rigorously defining the syntax
of complex applications!
Secondly, there is no reason for manual pages to differ greatly if
vendors start with the same text.
This means that users will see equivalent documentation on a number
of vendor's systems.
This is particularly true in Berkeley's case; since we freely allow
redistribution of our documentation, vendors that derive their 
systems from ours will, in all likelihood, deliver our documents
as theirs.
.pp
Finally, I believe that it does not disadvantage IEEE to allow this
use of the standard.
IEEE cannot provide manual entries for vendors to include, as each
vendor will need
to modify these entries in various ways, some of them fairly extensive.
As you can see from the ``cat'' command, we have local options to the
command that we must maintain for backward compatibility.
Also, each vendor, depending on the programs they wish users to use
for displaying their documentation, will require the manual pages to
be stored in a different format.
.pp
If I can answer any further questions, or clarify anything I've said,
please don't hesitate to contact me.  My work number is 415-642-8524.
