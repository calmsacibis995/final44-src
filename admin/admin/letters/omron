Dear Mr. Utena,
.PP
I wanted to thank you and Omron for your recent contributions of
software and two Luna workstations to us at the Computer Systems
Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley.
I am pleased to inform you that we included support for
the Omron workstation on our release of 4.4BSD.
The efforts of Akito Fujita to keep up with our ever changing
environment have been instrumental in keeping the Luna software
up to date with the rest of the 4.4BSD.
I am very pleased that Omron has seen this project through in these
recessionary times.
