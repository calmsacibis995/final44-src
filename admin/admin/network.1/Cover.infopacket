Dear Colleague:
.PP

We are happy to send you information about our first release of the
BSD networking software.
This software is copyright Berkeley, and may be freely redistributed.
It is available to anyone and requires no previous license, either from
AT&T or The Regents of the University of California.
.PP
This packet is designed to serve two purposes.
The first purpose is to acquaint you with the details of our distribution
so you can decide whether or not you would like to receive it.
The second purpose is to tell you how to obtain our distribution.
.SH
What is the networking software?
.PP
The distribution consists of one 1600 bpi magnetic tape, containing
source code and manual pages for most of the networking software
found in the standard 4BSD distribution.
Included are the standard user level applications, kernel support
and some C library support.
An attachment to this letter lists most of the files that will be
part of this distribution.
.SH
What support is available for this software?
.PP
It should be noted that this software has only been tested for compilation
and operation on the 4.3BSD-tahoe Berkeley distributions.
Only very limited support will be provided by our group. In particular,
we cannot provide assistance with installation of this software on
other systems.
We are, however, interested in any fixes that you find it necessary to
apply.
.SH
How to obtain this software
.PP
Before the distribution can be sent, we require:
.IP \(bu
Execution of the attached Berkeley License Agreement.
.IP \(bu
A check from a U.S. bank for $400.00 US, payable to
``The Regents of the University of California.''
If you must issue a Purchase Order, please issue one that is blank-backed.
If this is not possible, insert and initial in the body of the Purchase
Order the following clause: ``The terms and conditions of this Purchase
Order are not accepted by The Regents of the University of California.
The Berkeley License Agreement governs.''
Because we are a research and development organization and not a commercial
organization, this fee covers only our distribution costs.
.IP \(bu
The attached Site Information Form  and Checklist for Hardware/Software completely filled out and dated.
Your copy of the signed Berkeley License Agreement will be sent to the
person listed as the administrative contact.
The distribution itself will be sent to the technical contact.
The site information is kept confidential and is for our use in identifying
sites with specific configurations.
Please note that we cannot ship to post office boxes; therefore, please
have the technical contact's address supplied without use of a post office
box.
.bp
.PP
All the above material must be sent to:
.DS
Pauline Schwartz, Distribution Coordinator
Computer Systems Research Group
Computer Science Division, EECS
University of California
Berkeley, California 94720
.DE
Once these three items have been received and are in proper order, the
distribution will be sent to the technical address indicated on the
Site Information Form.
We cannot provide delivery dates.
Once the material is assembled and packaged, the distribution is shipped
by commercial carrier.
Order of shipment will be based on time of arrival of the properly
completed paperwork.
Because of the differential in costs of shipping outside the United States,
we ask that organizations beyond the North American continent pay
the collect shipping charges.
.PP
The most expedient way to insure that your full distribution is sent as
quickly as possible is to include, in a single package, two copies of the
completed and properly signed Berkeley License Agreement (\fBwithout
modification\fR), the check properly made out to ``The Regents of the
University of California,'' and a completely filled out Site Information
Form and Checklist for Hardware/Software, and to send this single package to 
the address noted above.
.PP
Please note that if you modify the Berkeley License Agreement, you may
experience a delay of three months or more before receiving an acceptance
or denial of the changes.  We reserve the right to cancel your application
if we have not received the requested paperwork within 60 days from the date
of our request. 
.SH
Special Cases
.PP
\fBUniversity of California Sites\fR.
If you are a part of the University of California,
\fByou must send 
the following items to the Computer Systems Research Group:\fR
1) a letter signed by the Director or Head of Department requesting
this distribution and stating that you have read and understood the Berkeley
License Agreement and that your organization will abide by it, 2)
an IOC for $400.00, and 3) a Site Information Form and Checklist for
Hardware/Software.
.PP
\fBDARPA Sites\fR.
The research on which the Berkeley Software Distributions are based is
sponsored by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).  Provision
has been made for prepayment of distribution costs for a few designated
DARPA sites.  In place of the check for $400.00, you should include a
letter from your Program Manager stating that you are designated as such
a site.  However, you \fBmust\fR comply with all other requirements in
applying for the distribution.
.SH
A Special Note 
.PP
The procedures and rules set out in this document are University constraints
which must be followed in order for the distribution of software to be
possible.
The Computer Systems Research Group has no control over these constraints
and must reject your application if material submitted is not in order.
.SH
If You Have Read Everything and Still Need Help
.PP
If you have questions about the licensing process after reading this letter,
you may call Pauline Schwartz at 415-642-7780, write to her, or contact her
via electronic mail at bsd-dist@ucbvax.berkeley.edu. or uunet!ucbvax!bsd-dist.
She will not be able to answer technical questions.
