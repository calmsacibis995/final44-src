This is a distribution kit for the first release of the BSD networking software.
This software is
Copyright \(co 1989 The Regents of the University of California,
but may be used and redistributed freely with due credit to the University;
see the license agreement for details.
(Note: your countersigned license agreement will be sent under separate cover.)
.PP
This package contains one 1200' 1600 BPI magnetic tape
which contains the C source code for the networking software
and troff-format manual pages and other documentation.
It is in \fItar\fP format with a blocking factor of 20.
It can be extracted into the current directory with a command such as
``tar x,''
``tar xf \fItapename\fP,''
or
``tar xbf 20 \fItapename\fP.''
Each program is in a separate directory which contains both the source
and the manual page(s) for the program.
The kernel-related sources are under the \fBsys\fP directory,
the include files meant for /usr/include are in the \fBinclude\fP directory, and
the library routines are in the \fBlib\fP directory.
Additional documentation is in the \fBdoc\fP and \fBman\fP directories.
.PP
It should be noted that this software has only been tested for compilation
and operation with the 4.3BSD-tahoe Berkeley distribution
or more recent systems now running on our development machines.
We cannot ensure that this software will compile or run on any other
systems.
Only very limited support will be provided by our group.
In particular,
we cannot provide assistance with installation of this software on
other systems.
We are, however, interested in any fixes that you find it necessary to
apply.
.PP
Bug reports about this distribution can be submitted using the sendbug
program on the tape, which will submit a formatted report to  
``4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.EDU'' on the Internet.
On the uucp net, modify sendbug 
to send to ``ucbvax!4bsd-bugs'' by an appropriate path.
Ideas for improvement of the system
should be sent to ``4bsd-ideas'', in the same network context.
If you have changes or other software which you would be willing
to share with others, let us know.
