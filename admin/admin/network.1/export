	Commodity Classification Request

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	We would like to request that the Commerce Department provide
a commodity classification for the Berkeley Software Distribution
Networking Release #1.  The software is primarily support for the DARPA
standard TCP, IP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP communication protocols.  It also
includes support for higher level application protocols such as FTP,
TELNET, SMTP, rcp, rlogin, and rsh.  It implements a wide-area network,
capable of connecting a large number of hosts over a geographically 
disperse area.  It implements the link, network, and transport layers
of the International Standards Organization Network Model, as well as
several applications.
	Attached are copies of the Networking Release License agreement,
the Networking Implementation Notes, 4.3BSD Edition, and the Berkeley
Software Architecture Manual, 4.3BSD Edition.
