This package contains one 6250 BPI 9-track magnetic tape, three 1600 BPI
9-track magnetic tapes or one 8mm Exabyte cassette.
The tape(s) contain the C source code for the software and documentation.
It is in
.I tar
format and can be extracted into the current directory with a command such
as ``tar x,'' or ``tar xf tapedevice''.
.PP
The distribution is in the framework of a complete system tree, with source
placed in the usr/src directory hierarchy.
Each utility is in a separate directory which contains both its source
and roff-format manual pages.
The kernel-related sources are in the usr/src/sys directory hierarchy.
D 2
The include files meant for /usr/include are in usr/src/include and

It should be noted that this software has only been tested for compilation
and operation with the 4.3BSD-Reno Berkeley distribution (or even more
recent systems now running on our development machines).
We cannot ensure that this software will compile or run on
.B any
other systems.
Only limited support will be provided by our group.
In particular,
we cannot provide assistance with installation of this software on
other systems.
We are, of course, interested in any fixes that you find it necessary to
apply, and will integrate these fixes into the 4.4BSD source distribution.
.PP
Bug reports about this distribution can be submitted using the sendbug
program on the tape, which will submit a formatted report to
D 2
``4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.EDU'' via the Internet.

I 2
``net2-bugs@Berkeley.EDU'' via the Internet.

On the uucp net, modify the sendbug script to send to
D 2
``uunet!ucbvax!4bsd-bugs'' by an appropriate path.
E 2

Ideas for improvement of the system should be sent to ``4bsd-ideas''
in the same network context.
If you have changes or other software which you would be willing to share
with others, please let us know.
