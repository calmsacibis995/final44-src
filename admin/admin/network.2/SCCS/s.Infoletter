In addition to the inclusion of the process scheduling and management funtions,

In addition to the inclusion of a much larger portion of the BSD system,

In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'',
E 3
I 3
In addition to the local ``fast filesystem'' (UFS),
E 3
we have added an implementation of the network filesystem (NFS)

E 5
Using TCP allows it to be used quickly and efficiently through
gateways and over long-haul networks.
We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs in
pageable memory, which allows large temporary filesystems without
requiring dedicated physical memory.
.PP
The quota system has been rewritten to support both
user and group quotas (simultaneously if desired).
Quota expiration is based on time rather than
the previous metric of number of logins over quota.
This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.
.PP
The new virtual memory implementation is derived from the MACH
D 3
operating system developed at Carnegie-Mellon.
The MACH virtual memory interface has been replaced with the
E 3
I 3
operating system developed at Carnegie-Mellon,
and was ported to the BSD kernel at the University of Utah.
The MACH virtual memory system call interface has been replaced with the
E 3
``mmap''-based interface described in the ``Berkeley Software
Architecture Manual'' (see UNIX Programmer's Manual, 
Supplementary Documents, PS1:6).
D 5
The interface is similar to the interface shipped
in several commercial versions of UNIX such as SunOS 4.0.
The current integration of the new virtual memory is functionally complete,

The interface is similar to the interfaces shipped

by several commercial vendors such as SMI, Convex Computer Corp.
E 10
I 10
by several commercial vendors such as Sun, Convex Computer Corp.
E 10
and AT&T.
The integration of the new virtual memory is functionally complete,
E 5
but still has serious performance problems under heavy memory load.
The internal kernel interfaces have not yet been completed
and the memory pool and buffer cache have not yet been merged.
These changes are expected before the release of 4.4BSD.
.PP
This distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified in the POSIX.1 system interface standard.
The biggest area of change is a new terminal driver.
The terminal driver is similar to the System V terminal driver
with the addition of the necessary extensions to get the
functionality previously available in the 4.3BSD terminal driver.
This distribution also adds the POSIX job control interface,
which is similar to the 4.3BSD job control interface,
but adds a security model that was missing in the
4.3BSD job control implementation.
D 3
Other additions include POSIX signals, FIFO's, byte-range file locking,
E 3
I 3
Other additions include POSIX signals, FIFOs, byte-range file locking,
E 3

I 5
There are a number of new tools and utilities included in this release.
I 7
A new version of make allows much-simplified makefiles for the system software
and allows compilation for multiple architectures from the same source tree
(which may be mounted read-only).
E 7
Notable additions to the libraries include functions to traverse a UNIX
file hierarchy, database interfaces to btree and hashing functions,
a new, fast implementation of stdio and a radix sort function.
The additions to the utility suite include greatly enhanced versions of
programs which display system status information, implementations of
various tools traditionally found in System V releases and many others.

Most of the libraries and header files have been converted
to be compliant with ANSI C.
D 3
The compiler default is to require ANSI C;
the default can be over-ridden by using the \fB-traditional\fP flag.
Another compiler default is to put strings into the shared text region.
This change obviates the need for the xstr and mkstr utilities.
The old behavior of placing strings in data space can be obtained

by specifying the \fB-Fwritable-strings\fP flag.

Work has also progressed in several other areas.
Several important enhancements have been added to the TCP/IP
protocols including TCP header prediction and
serial line IP (SLIP) with header compression.
The routing implementation has been completely rewritten
to use a hierarchical routing tree with a mask per route
to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the ISO protocols.
The routing table also stores and caches route characteristics
to speed the adaptation of the throughput and congestion avoidance
algorithms.

The reason that this distribution is not considered an alpha release of 4.4BSD

This release does include several important structural kernel changes.
D 3
The kernel uses a new internal system call convention:
.ft C
.nf
I 2
.ti +5i
E 2
error = (*callp)(proc, args, retval);
.fi
.ft P
E 3
I 3
The kernel uses a new internal system call convention;
the use of global (``u-dot'') variables for parameters and error returns
has been eliminated,
and interrupted system calls no longer abort using non-local goto's (longjmp's).
A new sleep interface separates signal handling from scheduling priority,
returning characteristic errors to abort or restart the current system call.
This sleep call also passes a string describing the process state,
which is used by the ps(1) program.
E 3
.PP
D 3
Another major change is the introduction
of a new sleep interface:
.ft C
.nf
I 2
.ti +5i
E 2
error = tsleep(wchan, pri|PCATCH, wstring, timeout);
.fi
.ft P
.LP
The old sleep interface can be used only for non-interruptible sleeps.
The \fItsleep\fP interface can be used at any priority,
but is only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.
When interrupted, \fItsleep\fP returns EINTR or ERESTART;
all non-local goto's (longjmp's) have been eliminated from the kernel.
