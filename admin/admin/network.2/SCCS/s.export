Commodity Classification Request
.sp
.pp
I would like to request a commodity classification for the Berkeley
Software Distribution Networking Release #2.
The distribution includes approximately 85% of a UNIX-like operating
system as well as approximately 250 user utilities.
.pp
I believe that the correct classification for this distribution is
EECN 5D01A, as described in the August 29, 1991 revision of the
Commodity Control List.
The reason for this classification is that the networking component of
the distribution supports the controlled technologies described in 5A03A,
paragraphs (d), (e) and (f).
Specifically, adaptive routing on a per-packet basis, the routing of
datagram packets and the ability to include data as part of the initial
connection negotiation packets are all supported.
.pp
I believe that the correct general export license is GTDA, as described
in the October 1990 Export Administration Regulations, section 779.3.
The reason for this is that the distribution is publicly available
as described in paragraph (b).
Specifically, the distribution is available to the general public with
minimal restrictions (see the attached licensing agreement for complete
details), and for a cost intended only to cover redistribution expenses.
Additionally, the recipient may, without further remuneration to the
University, redistribute the software as they choose.
.pp
This distribution is a subset of the software historically distributed
as part of the Berkeley Software Distribution, the most recent release of
which was 4.3BSD.
A similar distribution (Berkeley Software Distribution Networking Release
#1) was released in the spring of 1989, for which we received a GTDA
classification (CCATS #15697).
Attached are copies of the distribution license agreement, an informational
letter provided with the distribution, the Networking Implementation Notes,
4.3BSD Edition, and the Berkeley Software Architecture Manual, 4.3BSD Edition.
The latter two describe the architecture of the system as a whole as well
as the networking subsystem.
.pp
If I can provide any additional information, please contact me at
510-642-8524 or 510-549-1145.
