New file system organization
.PP
As in the old file system organization
each disk drive contains one or more file systems.
A file system is described by its super-block,
that is located at the beginning of its disk partition.
Because the super-block contains critical data
it is replicated to protect against catastrophic loss.
This is done at the time that the file system is created;
since the super-block data does not change,
the copies need not be referenced unless a head crash
or other hard disk error causes the default super-block
to be unusable.
.PP
To insure that it is possible to create files as large as
2\(ua32 bytes with only two levels of indirection,
the minimum size of a file system block is 4096 bytes.
The size of file system blocks can be any power of two
greater than or equal to 4096.
The block size of the file system is maintained in the super-block
so it is possible for file systems with different block sizes
to be accessible simultaneously on the same system.
The block size must be decided at the time that
the file system is created;
it cannot be subsequently changed without rebuilding the file system.
.PP
The new file system organization partitions the disk
into one or more areas called
.I "cylinder groups".
A cylinder group is comprised of one or more consecutive
cylinders on a disk.
Associated with each cylinder group is some bookkeeping information
that includes a redundant copy of the super-block,
space for inodes,
a bit map describing available blocks in the cylinder group,
and summary information describing the usage of data blocks
within the cylinder group.
For each cylinder group a static number of inodes
is allocated at file system creation time.
The current policy is to allocate one inode for each 2048
bytes of disk space, expecting this
to be far more than will ever be needed.
.PP
All the cylinder group bookkeeping information could be
placed at the beginning of each cylinder group.
However if this approach were used,
all the redundant information would be on the top platter.
Thus a single hardware failure that destroyed the top platter
could cause the loss of all copies of the redundant super-blocks.
Thus the cylinder group bookkeeping information
begins at a floating offset from the beginning of the cylinder group.
The offset for each successive cylinder group is calculated to be
about one track further from the beginning of the cylinder group.
In this way the redundant
information spirals down into the pack so that any single track, cylinder,
or platter can be lost without losing all copies of the super-blocks.
Except for the first cylinder group,
the space between the beginning of the cylinder group
and the beginning of the cylinder group information
is used for data blocks.\(dg
.FS
\(dg While it appears that the first cylinder group could be laid
out with its super-block at the ``known'' location,
this would not work for file systems
with blocks sizes of 16K or greater,
because of the requirement that the cylinder group information
must begin at a block boundary.
.FE
.NH 2
Optimizing storage utilization
.PP
Data is laid out so that larger blocks can be transferred
in a single disk transfer, greatly increasing file system throughput.
As an example, consider a file in the new file system
composed of 4096 byte data blocks.
In the old file system this file would be composed of 1024 byte blocks.
By increasing the block size, disk accesses in the new file
system may transfer up to four times as much information per
disk transaction.
In large files, several
4096 byte blocks may be allocated from the same cylinder so that
even larger data transfers are possible before initiating a seek.
.PP
The main problem with 
bigger blocks is that most UNIX
file systems are composed of many small files.
A uniformly large block size wastes space.
Table 1 shows the effect of file system
block size on the amount of wasted space in the file system.
The machine measured to obtain these figures is one of our time sharing
systems that has roughly 1.2 Gigabyte of on-line storage.
The measurements are based on the active user file systems containing
about 920 megabytes of formated space.

.TE
Table 1 \- Amount of wasted space as a function of block size.
.DE
.KE
The space wasted is measured as the percentage of space
on the disk not containing user data.
As the block size on the disk
increases, the waste rises quickly, to an intolerable
45.6% waste with 4096 byte file system blocks.
.PP
To be able to use large blocks without undue waste,
small files must be stored in a more efficient way.
The new file system accomplishes this goal by allowing the division
of a single file system block into one or more
.I "fragments".
The file system fragment size is specified
at the time that the file system is created;
each file system block can be optionally broken into
2, 4, or 8 fragments, each of which is addressable.
The lower bound on the size of these fragments is constrained
by the disk sector size,
typically 512 bytes.
The block map associated with each cylinder group
records the space availability at the fragment level;
to determine block availability, aligned fragments are examined.
Figure 1 shows a piece of a map from a 4096/1024 file system.

.DE
.KE
Each bit in the map records the status of a fragment;
an ``X'' shows that the fragment is in use,
while a ``O'' shows that the fragment is available for allocation.
In this example,
fragments 0\-5, 10, and 11 are in use,
while fragments 6\-9, and 12\-15 are free.
Fragments of adjoining blocks cannot be used as a block,
even if they are large enough.
In this example,
fragments 6\-9 cannot be coalesced into a block;
only fragments 12\-15 are available for allocation as a block.
.PP
On a file system with a block size of 4096 bytes
and a fragment size of 1024 bytes,
a file is represented by zero or more 4096 byte blocks of data,
and possibly a single fragmented block.
If a file system block must be fragmented to obtain
space for a small amount of data,
the remainder of the block is made available for allocation
to other files.
As an example consider an 11000 byte file stored on
a 4096/1024 byte file system.
This file would uses two full size blocks and a 3072 byte fragment.
If no 3072 byte fragments are available at the time the
file is created,
a full size block is split yielding the necessary 3072 byte
fragment and an unused 1024 byte fragment.
This remaining fragment can be allocated to another file as needed.
.PP
The granularity of allocation is the \fIwrite\fR system call.
Each time data is written to a file, the system checks to see if
the size of the file has increased*.
.FS
* A program may be overwriting data in the middle of an existing file
in which case space will already be allocated.
.FE
If the file needs to hold the new data,
one of three conditions exists:
.IP 1)
There is enough space left in an already
allocated block to hold the new data.
The new data is written into the available space in the block.
.IP 2)
Nothing has been allocated.
If the new data contains more than 4096 bytes,
a 4096 byte block is allocated and
the first 4096 bytes of new data is written there.
This process is repeated until less than 4096 bytes of new data remain.
If the remaining new data to be written will
fit in three or fewer 1024 byte pieces,
an unallocated fragment is located,
otherwise a 4096 byte block is located.
The new data is written into the located piece.
.IP 3)
A fragment has been allocated.
If the number of bytes in the new data plus the number of bytes
already in the fragment exceeds 4096 bytes,
a 4096 byte block is allocated.
The contents of the fragment is copied to the beginning of the block
and the remainder of the block is filled with the new data.
The process then continues as in (2) above.
If the number of bytes in the new data plus the number of bytes
already in the fragment will fit in three or fewer 1024 byte pieces,
an unallocated fragment is located,
otherwise a 4096 byte block is located.
The contents of the previous fragment appended with the new data
is written into the allocated piece.
.PP
The problem with allowing only a single fragment
on a 4096/1024 byte file system
is that data may be potentially copied up to three times
as its requirements grow from a 1024 byte fragment to
a 2048 byte fragment, then a 3072 byte fragment,
and finally a 4096 byte block.
The fragment reallocation can be avoided
if the user program writes a full block at a time,
except for a partial block at the end of the file.
Because file systems with different block sizes may coexist on
the same system,
the file system interface been extended to provide the ability to
determine the optimal size for a read or write.
For files the optimal size is the block size of the file system
on which the file is being accessed.
For other objects, such as pipes and sockets,
the optimal size is the underlying buffer size.
This feature is used by the Standard
Input/Output Library,
a package used by most user programs.
This feature is also used by
certain system utilities such as archivers and loaders
that do their own input and output management
and need the highest possible file system bandwidth.
.PP
The space overhead in the 4096/1024 byte new file system
organization is empirically observed to be about the same as in the
1024 byte old file system organization.
A file system with 4096 byte blocks and 512 byte fragments
has about the same amount of space overhead as the 512 byte
block UNIX file system.
The new file system is more space efficient
than the 512 byte or 1024 byte file systems in that it uses the same
amount of space for small files
while requiring less indexing information for large files.
This savings is offset by the need to use more space for keeping track
of available free blocks.
The net result is about the same disk utilization
when the new file systems fragment size
equals the old file systems block size.
.PP
In order for the layout policies to be effective, the disk
cannot be kept completely full.
Each file system maintains a parameter that
gives the minimum acceptable percentage of file system
blocks that can be free.
If the the number of free blocks drops below this level
only the system administrator can continue to allocate blocks.
The value of this parameter can be changed at any time,
even when the file system is mounted and active.
The transfer rates to be given in section 4 were measured on file
systems kept less than 90% full.
If the reserve of free blocks is set to zero,
the file system throughput rate tends to be cut in half,
because of the inability of the file system to localize the blocks
in a file.
If the performance is impaired because of overfilling,
it may be restored by removing enough files to
obtain 10% free space.
Access speed for files created during periods of little
free space can be restored by recreating them once enough
space is available.
The amount of free space maintained must be added to the
percentage of waste when comparing the organizations given
in Table 1.
Thus, a site running the old 1024 byte UNIX file system
wastes 11.8% of the space and one
could expect to fit the same amount of data into
a 4096/512 byte new file system with 5% free space,
since a 512 byte old file system wasted 6.9% of the space.
.NH 2 
File system parameterization
.PP
Except for the initial creation of the free list,
the old file system ignores the parameters of the underlying hardware.
It has no information about either the physical characteristics
of the mass storage device,
or the hardware that interacts with it.
A goal of the new file system is to parameterize the 
processor capabilities and
mass storage characteristics
so that blocks can be allocated in an optimum configuration dependent way. 
Parameters used include the speed of the processor,
the hardware support for mass storage transfers,
and the characteristics of the mass storage devices.
Disk technology is constantly improving and
a given installation can have several different disk technologies
running on a single processor.
Each file system is parameterized so that it can adapt
to the characteristics of the disk on which it is placed.
.PP
For mass storage devices such as disks,
the new file system tries to allocate new blocks
on the same cylinder as the previous block in the same file. 
Optimally, these new blocks will also be 
well positioned rotationally.
The distance between ``rotationally optimal'' blocks varies greatly;
it can be a consecutive block
or a rotationally delayed block
depending on system characteristics.
On a processor with a channel that does not require
any processor intervention between mass storage transfer requests,
two consecutive disk blocks often can be accessed
without suffering lost time because of an intervening disk revolution.
For processors without such channels,
the main processor must field an interrupt and
prepare for a new disk transfer.
The expected time to service this interrupt and
schedule a new disk transfer depends on the
speed of the main processor.
.PP
The physical characteristics of each disk include
the number of blocks per track and the rate at which
the disk spins.
The allocation policy routines use this information to calculate
the number of milliseconds required to skip over a block.
The characteristics of the processor include
the expected time to schedule an interrupt.
Given the previous block allocated to a file,
the allocation routines calculate the number of blocks to
skip over so that the next block in a file will be
coming into position under the disk head in the expected
amount of time that it takes to start a new
disk transfer operation.
For programs that sequentially access large amounts of data,
this strategy minimizes the amount of time spent waiting for
the disk to position itself.
.PP
To ease the calculation of finding rotationally optimal blocks,
the cylinder group summary information includes
a count of the availability of blocks at different
rotational positions.
Eight rotational positions are distinguished,
so the resolution of the
summary information is 2 milliseconds for a typical 3600
revolution per minute drive.
.PP
The parameter that defines the
minimum number of milliseconds between the completion of a data
transfer and the initiation of
another data transfer on the same cylinder
can be changed at any time,
even when the file system is mounted and active.
If a file system is parameterized to lay out blocks with
rotational separation of 2 milliseconds,
and the disk pack is then moved to a system that has a
processor requiring 4 milliseconds to schedule a disk operation,
the throughput will drop precipitously because of lost disk revolutions
on nearly every block.
If the eventual target machine is known, 
the file system can be parameterized for it
even though it is initially created on a different processor.
Even if the move is not known in advance,
the rotational layout delay can be reconfigured after the disk is moved
so that all further allocation is done based on the
characteristics of the new host.
.NH 2
Layout policies
.PP
The file system policies are divided into two distinct parts.
At the top level are global policies that use file system
wide summary information to make decisions regarding
the placement of new inodes and data blocks.
These routines are responsible for deciding the
placement of new directories and files.
They also calculate rotationally optimal block layouts,
and decide when to force a long seek to a new cylinder group
because there are insufficient blocks left
in the current cylinder group to do reasonable layouts.
Below the global policy routines are
the local allocation routines that use a locally optimal scheme to
lay out data blocks.
.PP
Two methods for improving file system performance are to increase
the locality of reference to minimize seek latency 
as described by [Trivedi80], and
to improve the layout of data to make larger transfers possible
as described by [Nevalainen77].
The global layout policies try to improve performance
by clustering related information.
They cannot attempt to localize all data references,
but must also try to spread unrelated data
among different cylinder groups.
If too much localization is attempted,
the local cylinder group may run out of space
forcing the data to be scattered to non-local cylinder groups.
Taken to an extreme,
total localization can result in a single huge cluster of data
resembling the old file system.
The global policies try to balance the two conflicting
goals of localizing data that is concurrently accessed
while spreading out unrelated data.
.PP
One allocatable resource is inodes.
Inodes are used to describe both files and directories.
Files in a directory are frequently accessed together.
For example the ``list directory'' command often accesses 
the inode for each file in a directory.
The layout policy tries to place all the files in a directory
in the same cylinder group.
To ensure that files are allocated throughout the disk,
a different policy is used for directory allocation.
A new directory is placed in the cylinder group that has a greater
than average number of free inodes,
and the fewest number of directories in it already.
The intent of this policy is to allow the file clustering policy
to succeed most of the time.
The allocation of inodes within a cylinder group is done using a
next free strategy.
Although this allocates the inodes randomly within a cylinder group,
all the inodes for each cylinder group can be read with
4 to 8 disk transfers.
This puts a small and constant upper bound on the number of
disk transfers required to access all the inodes
for all the files in a directory
as compared to the old file system where typically,
one disk transfer is needed to get the inode for each file in a directory.
.PP
The other major resource is the data blocks.
Since data blocks for a file are typically accessed together,
the policy routines try to place all the data
blocks for a file in the same cylinder group,
preferably rotationally optimally on the same cylinder.
The problem with allocating all the data blocks
in the same cylinder group is that large files will
quickly use up available space in the cylinder group,
forcing a spill over to other areas.
Using up all the space in a cylinder group
has the added drawback that future allocations for
any file in the cylinder group
will also spill to other areas.
Ideally none of the cylinder groups should ever become completely full.
The solution devised is to redirect block allocation
to a newly chosen cylinder group
when a file exceeds 32 kilobytes,
and at every megabyte thereafter.
The newly chosen cylinder group is selected from those cylinder
groups that have a greater than average number of free blocks left.
Although big files tend to be spread out over the disk,
a megabyte of data is typically accessible before
a long seek must be performed,
and the cost of one long seek per megabyte is small.
.PP
The global policy routines call local allocation routines with 
requests for specific blocks.
The local allocation routines will always allocate the requested block 
if it is free.
If the requested block is not available, the allocator
allocates a free block of the requested size that is
rotationally closest to the requested block.
If the global layout policies had complete information,
they could always request unused blocks and
the allocation routines would be reduced to simple bookkeeping.
However, maintaining complete information is costly;
thus the implementation of the global layout policy 
uses heuristic guesses based on partial information.
.PP
If a requested block is not available the local allocator uses
a four level allocation strategy:
.IP 1)
Use the available block rotationally closest
to the requested block on the same cylinder.
.IP 2)
If there are no blocks available on the same cylinder,
use a block within the same cylinder group.
.IP 3)
If the cylinder group is entirely full, 
quadratically rehash among the cylinder groups
looking for a free block.
.IP 4)
Finally if the rehash fails, apply an exhaustive search.
.PP
The use of quadratic rehash is prompted by studies of
symbol table strategies used in programming languages.
File systems that are parameterized to maintain at least
10% free space almost never use this strategy;
file systems that are run without maintaining any free
space typically have so few free blocks that almost any
allocation is random.
Consequently the most important characteristic of
the strategy used when the file system is low on space
is that it be fast.
