Subject: 'write' gives wrong time on initial message
Index: 	bin/write.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When 'write' makes the initial announcement, the time (hours:minutes)
	displayed is wrong.

Repeat-By:
	'write' to another terminal, note the time is incorrect.

Fix:
	It's another long vs. int problem, there is a missing declaration 
	of the time() function.
