Subject: su can corrupt environment
Index: 	bin/su.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If a username is more than about 10 characters (either by
	accident or intentionally) the buffer 'userbuf' will overflow
	causing a corrupt environment.

Repeat-By:
	Either be running on a system with usernames allowed to be
	greater than the standard 8, or inadvertently add a user with
	a loginname of 10 or more characters.  Note that the username
	is not truncated to the maximum number of characters that are
	in the utmp/wtmp structures.

Fix:
	Apply the patch below, it increases the userbuf to a size more
	in keeping with the overallocated sizes of the buffers which
	follow it.
