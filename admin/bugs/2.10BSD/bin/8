Subject: 'as' doesn't recognize the 'nop' instruction
Index: 	bin/as 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	the assembler 'as' doesn't recognize (yet another) instruction,
	the "nop" (no-operation).  This created a problem when recompiling
	the standalone system because some of the boot programs require
	a 'nop' as the first word.
	
Repeat-By:
	cd /tmp
	ed x.s
	a
	nop
	w
	q
	/bin/as x.s

	observe the error.

Fix:
	Somewhere along the way, the 'nop' handling either didn't make
	it in to the distribution OR the 'nop' pseudo-define was removed
	from pdp/DEFS.h.  IN ANY EVENT, an assembler should support ALL
	the instructions of the processor it runs on (should also be
	able to run split I/D and/or shared text, but i haven't gotten
	carried away enough yet), this is a small attempt to move in
	that direction.

	Apply the following patches to bin/as/{as19.s,as29.s} to implment
	'nop'.
