Subject: tcsh dumps core sometimes when login directory is a symbolic link
Index: 	contrib/tcsh 2.11BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If one's home directory is a symbolic link to another directory,
	and either tcsh is run from sh after the directory has been
	changed (from home or other place sh was first invoked), tcsh
	will dump core (alloc debugging on: botched free()).  This seems
	obscure, but happens when sh script changes directory then
	pushes an instance of tcsh for interactive use.
Repeat-By:
	set up a home directory which is a symbolic link: your files
	are in a disk mounted on /local_home, but your login directory is
	/user/local and:
		ln -s /local_home /user/local
	[Tcsh should be compiled with debugging of alloc.c turned on so
	errors can be seen and to cause core dumps.]
	Then login (using tcsh as shell), and:
		sh
		$ cd subdir
		$ tcsh
		[watch assertion botch and core dump]
		[adb shows free() error]
Fix:
	The getwd(path) call returns a pointer to an automatic array
	char path[MAXPATHLEN];  the code tries to free this pointer at
	the end of dcanon(), which doesn't work in BSD 2.11 pdp-11 
	compiler.

	From tcsh source directory, apply this patch:
	patch -N < thisfile
