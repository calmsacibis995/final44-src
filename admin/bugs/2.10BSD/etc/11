Subject: RESTart in ftpd fails above 32k
Index: etc/ftpd/ftpcmd.y 2.10BSD

Description:
	Attempting to RESTart a file transfer when the remote daemon
	is running on a machine where "sizeof (int) != sizeof (long)"
	fails when the offset/restartpoint is above 32767.

	The problem is (yet another *sigh *) long vs. int one.
	One would think that "sizeof (int) != sizeof (long)"  would
	be a more widely know fact, but alas not.

	The RESTart offset should be treated as a string and converted
	via atol() when needed.  In fact, the "long atol()" declaration
	was present in ftpcmd.y - but the function was never called.

Repeat-By:
	Connect to a ftp servor on a machine (likely a pdp-11) where
	"sizeof (int) != sizeof (long)" and do a "reget file" where
	the starting point would be > 32767.  Observe the error message
	and the mangled number (result of sign extending a short to a
	long.

Fix:
	Apply the following patch to ftpcmd.y, recompile and install.
