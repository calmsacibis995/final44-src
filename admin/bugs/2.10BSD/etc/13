Subject: ftpd free()'s data not malloc()'d
Index: 	etc/ftpd/ftpcmd.y 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If ftpd is passed an empty/null password he will issue a free()
	on memory which is in the .data segment, not something which was 
	malloc()'d.  This can lead to crashesand other odd behaviour.

Repeat-By:
	From a "ftp" client use the "user" command, and when asked for a 
	password simply hit return.  If the servor side crashes, it 
	defintely has the bug.

	An alternate method is to read the sources.  In ftpcmd.y,
	there is a section (~ line 113) which reads:

		PASS SP passwd CRLF
		= {
			pass((char *) $3);
			free((*char *) $3);
		}

	If an empty password is passed, the code around line 505
	assigns "" to the password rather than a malloc'd null string
	which can safely be freed later.

Fix:

	Apply the following patch to ftpcmd.y, it allocates a dynamic
	null string which can be freed later.
