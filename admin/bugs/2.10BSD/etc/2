Subject: sa generates "perposterous user id"s
Index: etc/sa 2.10BSD

Description:
	If /etc/passwd contains the user "nobody" (with uid 32767),
	every user id is considered preposterous, resluting in null
	output.
Repeat-By:
	Run sa with "nobody" in /etc/passwd.
Fix:
	When sa adds 10 to the max user id( 32767), it gets a negative
	number, which it then uses as a maximum legitimate user id.
	The following fix attempts to maintain the original idea of
	the maxuser variable.  Since there are rarely over 32000 users
	on a system, maxuser would be meaningless if a large user id
	were in the password file.  Thus, make the following change to
	sa.c:

	1024c1024
	<   if (pw->pw_uid > maxuid)
	---
	>   if ((pw->pw_uid > maxuid) && (pw->pw_uid <= 32767-USERSLOP))

	Obviously, there are many similar changes which would have the same
	net effect.
