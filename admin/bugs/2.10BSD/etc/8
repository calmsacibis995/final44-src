Subject: rwhod files have wrong mode
Index: 	etc/rwhod.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: <4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU>

Description:
	This isn't really a "bug", but a fix for an annoyance.  'rwhod'
	uses the system default for its umask() and can end up creating
	files which only the superuser can read.  the choice was to either
	make 'ruptime' setuid or reserved to superusers only, or to have 
	'rwhod' change the mode to something reasonable.

	The fix below or's in 0444 to the mode - forcing the files to
	be readable by everyone.

Repeat-By:
	Set the system umask to something like 026 or 066.  Kill the rwhod
	process, clean out the /usr/spool/rwho directory, start the
	rwhod process.

	Note that the files have modes of 0600 or 0640 and that non-superusers
	get nothing from the 'ruptime' command.

Fix:
	Apply the patch below to make sure the files are readable by everyone.
