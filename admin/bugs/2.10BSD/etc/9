Subject: Large UIDs cause 'sa' problems
Index: 	etc/sa.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	if you have the account of nobody::-2:-2: ....
	sa will complain that every account with a uid > 7 is 
	preposterous.

Repeat-By:
	create the account
	nobody:Nologin:-2:-2:anonymous NFS user:/:
	then run sa.

	Your line numbers may be somewhat different if the earlier
	patch to fix a conflict with the shadow password file 
	hasn't been applied.

Fix:
