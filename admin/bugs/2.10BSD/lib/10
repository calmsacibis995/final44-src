Subject: qsort(3) mishandles large arrays (+FIX)
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/qsort.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	In the qst function the variables `lo' and `hi' are declared 
	as `int'.  They should be `unsigned' or else qsort can bomb.  
	
Repeat-By:
	This bug crept up in a modified version of nm(1) being used
	to read the symbol table of /unix.
	/unix has ~3570 symbols. After multiplying that by
	the size of a symbol structure, the array which qsort(3)
	was asked to sort was over 32767, at which point qsort(3)
	malfunctioned.

Fix:

	Apply the following patch, then reinstall qsort into libc.a
	and libc_p.a
