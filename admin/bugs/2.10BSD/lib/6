Subject: save 4 bytes of text in sigvec.s
Index:	lib/libc/pdp/sys/sigvec.s 2.10BSD

Description:
	The stack cleanup logic did not take advantage of the fact that
	"mov (sp)+, (sp)" does not affect the carry bit.  By taking
	advantage of the pdp-11s architecture set 4 bytes of I-space
	may be conserved.

Repeat-By:
	Observation, i.e. RTFS.

Fix:
	Apply the following patch:
