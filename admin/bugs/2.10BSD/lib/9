Subject: u adb script missing a line
Index: 	lib/adb/u 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The /usr/lib/adb/u script produces misaligned output for 
	user structure members from u_quota on.
	
Repeat-By:
	Use adb to pretty print a u struct.  Note the values for
	u_base, and so on are off by one word.

Fix:
	Apply the patch below to /usr/lib/adb/u.  The u_quota member is
	present even if quotas are not included in the system (same as in
	4.3BSD) so that programs dealing with u structs do not have to
	be recompiled if quotas are present or not.
