Possible documentation bug
(also mail path check)

Along with the select-on-pipes bug I reported to you today,
it's possible that the on-line manual page for pipes
should be altered; it currently says that pipes are a special
case of socketpairs, and the socketpairs man page says that 
socketpairs are sockets.  If I understood what you said about
pipes NOT being sockets, these manual pages could be misleading
or wrong.
