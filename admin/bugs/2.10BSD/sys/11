Subject: PSW not saved before restore.
Index: sys/sys/kern_time.c 2.10BSD

Description:
	The call to spl7() in gettimeofday() uses the wrong function.
	Later the PSW is loaded with the random contents of R0. I
	haven't seen any problems but the system potentially could
	hang.

Repeat-By:
	Examine the assembler output.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch and recompile.
