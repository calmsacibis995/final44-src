Subject: Badsector handling is done incorrectly,
Index: sys/pdpuba/xp.c 2.10BSD

Description:
	Badsector handling is done incorrectly, with some being done
	correctly but most not.
Repeat-By:
	Try to read or write badblocks on an xp.c disk with block sizes
	greater than 512bytes; see the attempt fail by causing spurious
	"file system full" messages, with resulting file system damage,
	or sometimes "panic: red kernel violation trap" with subsequent
	crashes (tar on raw device is particularly good at this).
Fix:
	Apply the patch below.   

The main error is division by NBPW in line 857 of xp.c; since
that is defined as sizeof(int), and sizeof is an unsigned operator,
the division is promoted to unsigned, and the result is a nonsense
number in the 32000's range, i.e. the unsigned value shifted right
one bit as an unsigned number.  The division at l. 962 may also be
a problem.  I also rearranged the expression to be more readable.
