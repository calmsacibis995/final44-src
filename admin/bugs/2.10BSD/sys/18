Subject: same directory can be mounted on multiple times
Index: sys/sys/ufs_mount.c 2.10BSD

Description:
	
	The same directory can be mounted on twice using different
	devices.  This causes confusion and possibly problems later on 
	when an umount is done.
	
Repeat-By:

	/etc/mount /dev/ra0h /usr
	/etc/mount /dev/ra1h /usr

	note that no error is issued, 

Fix:

	Apply the following patch to /usr/src/sys/sys/ufs_mount.c, it is
	safe to do this because the mount of the root filesystem does
	not go thru the smount() routine.
