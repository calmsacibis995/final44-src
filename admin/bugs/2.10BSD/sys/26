Subject: trivial change  to 'config'
Index: 	sys/config 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The idle pattern display in the light register has code ifdef'd
	on IDLE_DISPLAY in mch_xxx.s, unfortunately 'config' provides
	no way to enable this option.  Thought i'd done this already,
	but evidently not.

Repeat-By:
	Build a kernel for an 11/70, observe the lack of an 'idle' pattern.
Fix:
	Apply this patch to /sys/sys/config.  An alternate method would
	have been to simply remove the ifdef in mch_xxx.s, wouldn't hurt
	anything and only takes a couple words of text space.
