Subject: Network Device Interrupts Not Counted
Index: 	sys/pdp/net_trap.s 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Interrupts from network interfaces are not counted if metering
	(UCB_METER) is selected at system configuration time.

Repeat-By:
	Either by examination of the code, or by performing an rlogin
	to/from a 2.10.XBSD system and running 'vmstat' on another terminal.

Fix:
	Since the interrupt count is in kernel space, the count must
	be retrieved via "mfpd" and put back with "mtpd".  By performing
	the increment after the PSW has been loaded with 040340 the overhead
	of counting interrupts is reduced to only two instructions.

	Apply the following patch to /sys/pdp/net_trap.s and if UCB_METER
	is being used, recompile the kernel and networking.
