Subject: if_acc (and others) missing an argument
Index: 	sys/pdpif/if_acc.c,... 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The network interface drivers if_acc, if_sri, if_en, if_css and if_dmc
	are all missing an argument to if_rubaget() - the network interface
	pointer.

Repeat-By:
	Inspection of the source.  The DMA based drivers which are known to work
	(if_il.c and if_vv.c) have the fourth argument.

	Or hook up an LH/DH-11 and attempt
	to use (the latest version from an earlier posting) the if_acc
	driver.  The driver will attach successfully and crash after 
	the first input data is received.

Fix:
	There are undoubtedly more bugs in these drivers, but for now
	apply the following patches.
