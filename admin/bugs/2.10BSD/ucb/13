Subject: ftp mishandles dotted quad addresses
Index: 	ucb/ftp/ftp.c 2.10BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	ftp can not connect to a remote system given a dotted quad
	as a system name.

Repeat-By:
	attempt to ftp to a known system using its IP address.  

Fix:

	The problem is (yet another!) long vs. int problem.  inet_addr
	returns a 32bit number, the appropriate declaration was missing.
	the include file inet/arpa/inet.h provides the missing declaration.
