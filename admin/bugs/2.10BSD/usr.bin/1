Subject: uuq doesn't print out effective baud rates correctly for large values
Index: usr.bin/uucp/uuq.c 2.10BSD

Description:
	If you use uuq's -b switch to specify a different baud rate to compute
	transfer rates with, uuq won't print the effective baud rate out
	correctly for large values (like 9600) because of float to int
	overflow.  The fix included below is also appropriate for 4.3BSD.
Repeat-By:
	Try ``uuq -b9600'' and not that the effective baud rate is shown as
	"0".
Fix:

! 				minutes,(int)baudrate/6);
  		}
  		putchar('\n');
  		if (hflag)
