Apparently-To: 2bsd-bugs@berkeley.edu
Index:  usr.bin/f77/equivalence.c	2.10BSD

Description:
	f77pass1 complaints about equivalence statements
	("bad alignment forced"). With some equivalences it doesn't
	complain, but then As complaints (I'm not sure
	but I think it was about relocation errors).
	The following program compiles ok with 2.9 & 4.3.


Repeat-By:
	Try to compile the following program:

	program	test
	real a(2),a1,a2
	equivalence (a(1),a1),(a(2),a2)
	end

	F77pass1 complaints about "bad alignments forced by
	equivalence".
