Subject: Memory Leak in sendmail alias initialization
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/alias.c 2.10BSD

Description:
	When a large number (>1000) of aliases are present in
	/usr/lib/aliases 'sendmail' runs out of memory leaving
	the database partially built.

Repeat-By:
	Have a /usr/lib/aliases file with more than 1000 aliases,
	run "/usr/lib/sendmail -bi".

Fix:
	Apply the following patch, the address structures weren't being
	freed.  The same 'problem' exists in 4.3BSD, but what's a few
	kilobytes on a Vax.
