Have you noticed that:

cc `basename $i .o`.c

gets a segmentation violation if you are running csh compiled -n?
The problem is that GAVSIZ defined to be NCARGS/6 which gives you
about 850 possible arguments in a glob!  There is a routine which
has an automatic array which is *char [GAVSIZ] or about 1700 bytes
and it is called fairly deeply nested so it runs out of stack space.
If you feel that having 850 args to a program is nice you will have
to run -i otherwize you can define GAVSIZ to something smaller
(we use 400).
