If you do "stty raw" in the C-shell, typing any character that
is odd in octal will log you out immediately.  The Bourne shell
does not have this problem.  Does anybody know what's happening?
This happens with the C-shell in 2.8 bsd, 4.0 bsd, and 4.1 bsd. 
I have no solution.

Sorry, this article belongs under net.bugs.csh, but there isn't
any such newsgroup.
