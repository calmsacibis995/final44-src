Subject: Very minor bug in lastcomm and sa
Newsgroups: net.bugs.4bsd
Index: bin/lastcomm 2.9BSD

This is really pretty trivial, but I might as well mention it.  Lastcomm.c
has the 60 Hz line frequency hard coded into it (line 123).  Hence it
wouldn't give correct time figures for systems running on 50 Hz power.
The same goes for sa.c.

I found this bug while trying to write my own code to deal with accounting
times kept in CPU clock ticks.  Now that the line frequency is set in a
configuration file, it is much harder to get at.  I could go into /dev/kmem and
dig it out, but I think that that's too much work for the payoff.

Does anybody run with a 50 Hz line?  Have you ever even heard of a site
that did?
