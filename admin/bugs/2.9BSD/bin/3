Subject: /bin/sh ignores job control
Index:	bin/sh/main.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	/bin/sh and all shell scripts which used it would ignore job
	control signals if they were invoked by a csh.
Repeat-By:
	Login with a csh, type /bin/sh and try to suspend it with a
	^Y or ^Z. Watch nothing happen.
Fix:
	Someone made /bin/sh ignore signal 18 (SIGTSTP). Remove it.
	This is consistant with the 4.2 behavior.
