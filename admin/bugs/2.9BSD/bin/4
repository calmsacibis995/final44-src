Subject: cc does not pass -i flag to ld
Index: 	bin/cc.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	compile any program with cc using -v and -i flags note -i not in ld line
Repeat-By:
	as above
Fix:
	The addition of the code to check for the iflag so as to automatically
	include the separate i/d fpsim code, broke the default copying of
	flags to the loader.  It seems that changing the break following
	the incrementing of the flag to goto passa is enough
	A warning about this might also be included.
