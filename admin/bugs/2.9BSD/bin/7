Subject: 2.9BSD login bug
Subject: Login does not close the /etc/nologin file.
Index:	 bin/login.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	If the /etc/nologin file is present, login opens it but
	never closes it. In general, this is not a problem since
	a normal user would exit after this. If the user is root
	thought, this could be a problem.

Repeat-By:
	grep nlfd login.c	to see that nlfd is never closed.

Fix:
	Add 'fclose( nlfd )' to login.c as indicate below.

		.
		.
		.
	if (pwd->pw_uid != 0 && (nlfd = fopen(nolog, "r")) > 0) {
		/* logins are disabled except for root */
		while ((c = getc(nlfd)) != EOF)
			putchar(c);
		fflush(stdout);
		fclose( nlfd );			<<<< add this
		sleep(5);
		exit(0);
	}
	if ( nlfd > 0 )				<<<< and this
		fclose( nlfd );			<<<< and this
#ifdef	SP_SESS
		.
		.
		.

NOTE: The first 'fclose( nlfd )' is not really needed since an
      exit is done, but it seems natural to close files
      yourself instead of leaving it to the system.
