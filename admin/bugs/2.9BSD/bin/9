Subject: login needs gethostname
Index: 	bin/login.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	Login uses the gethostname system call.  Unfortunately, gethostname
	is defined in the UCB_NET code.
Repeat-By:
	cc -o login login.c
Fix:
	Several fixes are possible.  The simplest is to conditionalize
	all the code in login.c that uses the hostname variable on
	#ifdef	UCB_NET.  Another alternative is to put gethostname in
	your kernel (independently of the network code).

Subject: ignore previous gethostname complaint (sorry)
Index: 	bin/login.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	gethostname works perfectly, even when UCB_NET is not defined.
	Please ignore my previous bogus bug report.
Repeat-By:
	Build the C library incorrectly, and then make a fool of your self.
Fix:
	Retreat into a corner.
