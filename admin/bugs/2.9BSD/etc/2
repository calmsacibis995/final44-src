Subject: sa(8) doesn't work properly with UCB_LOGIN set
Index: 	etc/sa.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	sa(8) prints out garbage statistics when run on a 2.9BSD system
	that has UCB_LOGIN defined in its configuration
Repeat-By:
	Configure a 2.9BSD system with UCB_LOGIN defined, and try running sa.
	Recompiling sa.c makes no difference.
	(note that ACCT must be defined, too, for any of this to make sense)
Fix:
	sa.c (like lastcomm.c) doesn't include sys/localopts.h, so in the
	declaration of the acct struct in sys/acct.h, the part of the
	declaration within #ifdef UCB_LOGIN/#endif never gets compiled in,
	even though it is compiled into the kernel, and hence the accounting
	records have this format.  
	The fix, then, is to #include <sys/localopts.h> before sys/acct.h
	in sa.c
