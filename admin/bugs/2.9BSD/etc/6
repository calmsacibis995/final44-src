Subject: init can kill all processes
Index: 	etc/init.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	All running processes on the system can be killed.  The system then
	immediately comes back up multi-user.
	(This bug also existed in 2.9 beta.)
Repeat-By:
	Generate an interrupt on a line that has just come ready.
	This happens on our port selector occasionally.
Fix:
	The problem is that SIGINT is not reset when init forks off a child.
	If an interrupt is generated on the line before getty is exec'ed,
	the child does a kill(-1, SIGKILL) in preparation for special
	session mode.

	In dfork, around line 416 (just after the if (pid == 0) test) add
		signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
