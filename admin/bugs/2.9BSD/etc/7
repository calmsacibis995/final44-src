Subject: problems with /etc/init
Index: etc/init 2.9BSD

We experiencing intermittent problems with /etc/init on our 2.9BSD PDP 11/44
machine.  Weekly, Daily, or even hourly 'init' will kill all or almost all of
the processes on the system, spawn new 'getty's and resume as normal.  It even
logs 'shutdown' in the /usr/adm/shutdown_log.  I have applied a number of
debugging statements to point out exactly where it starts the killing.  It
appears to take place in the routine called sp_ss() which normally calls
special session for designated terminals.  The problem occurs so randomly
like it caught an INTterupt or KILL signal.
	If anyone has had a similar problem, please contact me via
UUCP, especially if you've got a fix for it.
