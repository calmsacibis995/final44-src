Maybe this should go in net.trivia, it seems obscure.
This is everything I always wanted to ask about getty but was
previously afraid or too lazy to ask.

4.1bsd getty.c has some weird code in it.

First of all, right at the top, there are two signal calls commented out:

/*
	signal(SIGINT, 1);
	signal(SIGQUIT, 0);
*/

Why were they there, why are they commented out?

There are table entries for Interdata consoles and LSI chess
terminals.  I bet the LSI chess terminal works on all of one cpu and I
have never heard of anyone on USENET running on an Interdata or Perkin
Elmer machine.  (Those P/E machines look so HOT in the ads, howcome no
one on USENET has one?)  Do these beasts in fact exist, running UNIX
processes for humans on Earth?  Let yourselves be known!  (Take me to
your leader?)

Then there's this bit of sorcery in the prompt/read loop:

		if (tmode.sg_ospeed > B1200)
			puts("\n\r\n\r");
		else
			puts("\n\r\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r");
		puts(myname);
		puts("\n\r\r\r\r");
		puts(tabp->message);
		/*
		 * Wait a while, then flush input to get rid
		 * of noise from open lines
		 */
		sleep(1);
		stty(0, &tmode);

When I hit a carriage return and try to log in, it eats the first few
characters of my login name.  The comment says that it's trying to get rid
of line noise.  Is this behavior worthwhile?

I used to have a problem that if I logged into the console with ALL
CAPS (like when Mr DEC Fieldservice leaves caps locked on the LA120)
getty would go into an infinite loop which could only be killed from
another terminal.  Anyone ever see this?

I would like it if my dialups hung up on last close.  I believe that I
properly configured my 4.1bsd kernel to perform this function, but it
only seems to work SOMETIMES.  Has anyone else had this experience and
is it tied to getty?
