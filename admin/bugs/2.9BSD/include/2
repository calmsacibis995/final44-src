Subject: mtab.h doesn't match /etc/mtab
Index: 	include/mtab.h 2.9BSD

Description:
	The standard include file mtab.h, which allegedly defines the
	format of the file /etc/mtab, doesn't.  It contains the spurious
	field m_dev, of type dev_t.  The REAL mtab, as created by 'mount'
	and umount, has no such field.
Repeat-By:
	Looking at /usr/include/mtab.h and /usr/src/cmd/mount.c - the
	mtab structures don't match.
Fix:
	Change /usr/include/mtab.h.
