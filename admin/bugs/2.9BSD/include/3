Subject: /usr/include/mtab.h incorrect
Index: 	include/mtab.h 2.9BSD

Description:
	/usr/include/mtab.h doesn't match the format of /etc/mtab
	as created by 'mount'.  In a previous report, I mentioned
	the spurious field, m_mdev, but in addition, the fields
	are reversed, ie., in mount the structure is:

	struct mtab {
		char	file[NAMSIZ];
		char	spec[NAMSIZ];
	} mtab[NMOUNT];

	in mtab.h, it is:

	struct	mtab	{
		dev_t	m_dev;		 	/* major/minor device numbers */
		char	m_dname[DEVSIZE];	/* block device pathname */
		char	m_name[PATHSIZE];	/* mounted on pathname */
	};


Repeat-By:
	Looking at /usr/include/mtab.h, then examining /usr/src/cmd/mount.c,
	or 'od -c /etc/mtab'.
Fix:
	Rewrite /usr/include/mtab.h.
	Delete m_dev, and swap m_dname and m_name.
