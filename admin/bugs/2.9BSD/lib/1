Subject: "-ME MACRO FIX REQUEST"
To: 4BSD-BUGS@BERKELEY

Index: lib 2BSD

Help! We are having some software problems with -me but don't really have time
to dig into the code.  Our -me is running on a 2.8BSD system. 
The main problem arewhen using .(l and .)l lists, nested, the indentation following the .)l
does not properly "pop" one back to the right level until the last
nested .)l.
This results in .(l
 text
 .(l
 list
 .)l
 more text
 .)l
 end of lists
appears as Start
 
    indented text
   
        indented list
   
        improperly more text
 
 properly unindented end of lists
 
What is the mod to fix this?
 
Also,  we have a problem with foot notes which appear near the top of a vtroff
page.  If this condition exists, the foot note appears at the bottom of the
page in bold font, we presume due to the fact that the headers (and perhaps
footers) are also bold fonts.
 
Do you have a fix for this?
 
Lastly, delayed text does not seem to be working well on our system.
the macro \*#  (Excuse me, I am writing to you on an IBM not a unix system
the last three chars were backslash,star,pound sign. The Macro should
print a * (star), but we get [1], [2], etc. and the .(d and .)d
text blocks are not printed.
 
Thanks you help is appreciated on these macros.
 
Lastly, a networking question...Because our net access is through a cranky
old IBM, it sends it's ARPAnet headers to net relays in upper case,
I assume the Berkeley software gateway wants strictly uppercase paths
names for the Usenet.  Is this the case?
 
Gratefully,
