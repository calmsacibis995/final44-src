Subject: libc.a optimization
Index: 	lib/c 2.9BSD

Description:
	The compall and derivatives make libc.a about 71K bytes larger
	than it has to be.
Repeat-By:
	Trying to make apl, and getting symbol table overflow from
	the loader in one of the libc.a routines.
Fix:
	For each file assembled with the file /usr/include/sys.s
	run the loader with -r -x flags.
	i.e.
	as - -o t.o /usr/include/sys.s syscall.s
	ld -r -x t.o -o syscall.o
