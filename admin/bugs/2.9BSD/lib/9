Subject: The gethostname routine leaves a file descriptor open.
Index: lib/c/gen/gethostname.c 2.9BSD

Description:
        The gethostname library routine leaves the file descriptor used
	to read /etc/localhostname open.  This reduces the number of
	file descriptors available to the program.
Repeat-By:
        Examination of code.  The file descriptor is kept in an
	automatic variable and so is lost on return from the function.
	The routine contains no close at all.  Or have a routine call
	gethostname repeatedly.  After all file descriptors have been
	used the call will fail.
Fix:
	Add a close after the read.

	gethostname.c
	--- 22,28 -----
			return(-1);
		}
		hostnamelen = read(fd, &hostname, sizeof hostname);
	+ 	close(fd);
		if (hostnamelen < 0) {
			errno	= EFAULT;
			return(-1);
