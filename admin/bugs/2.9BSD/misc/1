Subject: Bug report

Subject: Installing/Operating Documentation in error for rm05 case
Index:   misc/setup/setup.2 2.9BSD

Description:
	The document lists "5168" as the size value to feed into the
	standalone mkfs was building a root on an rm05 type disk drive.
	Although the mkfs and restore seem to work, the resulting
	file system is not stable as the file system actually exceeds
	the partition boundries in the system device driver.

Repeat-By:
	Try and build a system on an rm05 or rm05 lookalike.

Fix:
	Correct the documentation.  The system device size tables
	show that the "a" partition for an rm05 to be 9120 sectors
	long, so the proper number to feed to mkfs is "4560".
