	I got your noet about receiving the login bug but not the init
bug report. I have resent the report. Let me know if it makes it 
through. (This one is important.)
	I am replying to your message via the bugs because I am not
sure about the return address. I'm a rookie on this networking stuff
and the reference to ARPA has me confused about how I should respond.
