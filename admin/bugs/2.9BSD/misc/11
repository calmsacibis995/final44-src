Subject: Building in the TS driver into 2.9 UNIX
Index: misc 2.9BSD

Description:
     We have just created a version of 2.9bsd unix on our pdp-11/44 which
     includes the following in it configuration file:

       TM      1
       TS      1

     First: I only have a TS tape drive, but when I ommitted the TM 1 line
     the new OS would not compile - there were two errors in mch.i. So i
     included the TM entry and it compiled.


     Second: I installed the new unix and booted it after changing /etc/dtab
     to look for the TS drive. All seemed well until i created the entries
     in /dev for ts by executing  MAKE ts0  and MAKE ts1.

     Third: I tried to read a tar tape but could only get the message
     'tar: cannot open /dev/rmt0'. I also tried it with device 1 but
     got a similar message.

     Fourth: I removed all of the /dev/*mt* entries and tried again --
     SAME RESULTS.

     WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG??
Repeat-By:
     See above.
