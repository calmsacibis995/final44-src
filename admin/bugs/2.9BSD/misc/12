Subject: 2.9 Installation Problems.
Index: misc 2.9BSD

My department recently received its copy of the BSD 2.9 release 2
distribution tape. I have had some problems with the installation
of the system and I hope that you can help with some information.
Firstly, I shall describe our installation:-

	PDP 11/44
	1 Megabyte of memory
	No floating point hardware
	2 dz11 multiplexors
	2 rl02 disk drives
	1 ra80 drive attached to a UDA50.

I couldn't find a UDA50 driver in the /usr/src/sys directory.
Can you supply us with a driver or do you know where we can obtain one?

Although we can't use the ra80 I have been trying to build a system for
the following configuration

	PDP 11/44
	1 Megabyte of memory
	2 dz11
	2 rl02

I created the following configuration file

pdp11		44
ident		DCL
maxusers	15
bootdev		rl
timezone	0
dst		3
#
rootdev		makedev(8,0)	#rl0
swapdev		makedev(8,0)	#rl0
dumpdev		NODEV
pipedev		makedev(8,0)	#rl0
swaplo		8240
nswap		2000
dumplo		0
dumproutine	nodev
#
NRL		1
NDZ		2

I ran configure DCL and the edited whoami.h so as to define NONFP
and in param.c I changed HZ from 60 to 50.

A new unix was compiled and installed in /.

The file etc/dtab was changed to

rl  ?	174400	160	5	rlio	;
dz  0	160100	320	5	dzin dzdma	; DZ11 terminal mux
dz  1   160110	330	5	dzin dzdma	; DZ11 terminal mux

When the new unix was booted autoconfigure reported:-

rl  ? csr  174400 vector 160 didn't interrupt
dz  0 csr  160100 vector 320 attached
dz  1 csr  160110 vector 330 attached

There was no problem with the rl interrupt in the GENERIC system.
I checked out the CSR and vector addresses in the files c.c and l.s
and they seem correct. Have you any suggestions as to where we have gone wrong?
(As an aside because we are swapping on rl0 in dev I linked swap to rl0,
is this correct?)

The third problem concerns both our system and the GENERIC system.
When working for a while in single user mode rl0 seems to run out of free space.
Indeed after a few minutes of operation fsck invariably reports:-

/dev/rl0
File System: /
...
** Phase 5 - Check Free List
BAD FREE BLK COUNT
BAD FREE LIST
SALVAGE?

Does this indicate a problem with your rl driver? If so do you have any fixes?

	I hope that you will be able to help
