Subject: Cannot get Makefile to work to install kernal in 2.9 (PDP 11/44)
Index: misc 2.9BSD

     I am trying to install version 2.9 on a PDP 11/44, and while running the
MAKEFILE under /usr/src/sys/MYDIRECTORY, where MYDIRECTORY is the one that was
set up during the install process, the following occurs:

     The compilation of all routines completes normally, but the loading
portion of the Makefile bombs.  I get a UNDEFINED SYMBOL message for _etext,
_spl7, _spl6, _spl5, in that order.

     I checked all the program source, etc, and tried a number of different
combinations within the Makefile, I couldn't get any to work.  I also tried
the version of make in /usr/70, that didn't work either.  By the way, we are
trying to install the NON-separate I/D version, that is, the usual one.

     All the modifications are already in place to the appropriate files, all
I have to do is get through the Makefile to generate a kernal.

     This system should have been up 2 weeks ago, I just spent a week playing
with the Makefile, so I am in rather desparate need of help.  Please advise
what to try next via netmail to the address in the header, or I can be phoned
at the number below.

     My home phone, just in case you need it, is (201) 745-7672.  Call
anytime.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.  (And if you help me
get this running soon, some beer will be on it's way to Berkeley in care of
you!)
