Dear bsd-people,
  I'm running UNIX since september last year. All things work well
but I've a problem with installing LISP. I have send you today
a report by airmail in "sendbug" format together with a "typescript"
protocol. I hope this helps you. I'm sure that I made a mistake be-
cause I do not interpret file "usr/src/ucb/lisp/v7source/sparm.m11"
correct.

BITNET to EARNnet.
  ...and a nice Valentin's day. with best wishes.  Carl
