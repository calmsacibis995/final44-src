Subject: upcoming book
Index: misc 2.9BSD

I'm writing a book about portable C code, and I'd like to get a copy
of the manuals for all major implemetations of C.  I'd like to include
2BSD in this.  Would it be possible for me to get a copy of the current
2BSD manual?  (I just need the parts that are visible from a C program,
namely the system calls, C library, and some idea of what the C compiler
itself looks like, e.g. does it have (void), flexnames, is it tracking the
new ANSI standard?)  A list of which shell commands are there, for the
system(3) call, would be helpful too.

Either machine readable or hardcopy would be fine.

Thanks!

	Mark
