Dear 2.9BSD Support Group

	I am having trouble installing 2.9BSD on a PDP 11-44. I seem to be
missing the files in directory /usr/src/sys/conf.  In particular the shell
program config can not be found anywhere.  Also the system as booted by calling
rl(0,0)rlunix seems to hang up almost immediately as soon as I go multi-user.
A small problem that I have found is that on page 7 of 'Installing and Operating
2.9BSD' suggests making an 8500 block rlo2 system but in genallsys.sh the rlo2
swap space is started at block 8000.  Finally, a small suggestion is to mention in the manual that a sample file exist exists for /etc/fstat.  I wasted half a
day before I happened to see it (since I was running off the console I wasn't
printing out the directory contents).  I am sending this message from my
student's account (as we don't have a computer in the EE department at UCLA
that is tied into the net).  If you could direct any reply's back to this
account I would greatly appreciate it.  I thank you in advance for any
assistance you can give to help me solve this problem.
