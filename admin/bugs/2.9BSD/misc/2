Subject:  Second Request.

Index: misc 2.9BSD

Anyone there?  Help!  The following message was sent last Monday, June 25,
1984.  If you cannot help, please acknowledge.  Thanks in advance.

To Whom it May Concern:

   We (The Department of Computer Science at The University of Mississippi)
recently received the 2.9BSD distribution.  Unfortunately, I have read
errors on both tapes.  I was able to boot off the binary tape, but could
not read the later tar format files.  I could read the second tar tape with
dd, but a second read error in block 0 prevented me from using tar to read
that second tape.
   May we obtain another distribution copy?  Would you like the old tapes?
If so, where should I send them?  Would you like me to send two blank tapes?
Thank you for your time and trouble.
