Subject:  Fourth request for help.
Index: misc 2.9BSD

Anyone there?  The following message was sent June 25, June 30, & July 9
1984.  If you cannot help, please acknowledge.  Thanks in advance.

To Whom it May Concern:

   We (The Department of Computer Science at The University of Mississippi)
recently received the 2.9BSD distribution.  Unfortunately, we have read
errors on both tapes.  We were able to boot off the binary tape, but could
not read the later tar format files.  We could read the second tar tape with
dd, but a second read error in block 0 prevented me from using tar to read
that second tape.
   May we obtain another distribution copy?  Would you like the old tapes?
If so, where should they be sent?  Would you like two blank tapes?
Thank you for your time and trouble.
