Subject: TS11 distribution
Index: misc 2.9BSD

We recently received our 2.9 distribution on a MT/HT bootable tape. We had
originally asked for a TS11 bootable tape but were told that such a tape
would not be available for some time (at least a month or 2). I thought that
i could arrange the loan of a suitable tape interface for my 11/73 so that
i could boot the tape we got, however, this is not the case and i am left
with trying to build a TS11 bootable version of the distribution myself, at
night, on someone else's machine or finding someone who has solved this
problem.
	What is the status of the TS11 version of the dist. tape? Has some-
one out in 2.9land made a TS11 driver for the boot programs and standalone
utilities? If so, can I have it? What best to do?
