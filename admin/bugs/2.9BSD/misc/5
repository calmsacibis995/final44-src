Index: misc 2.9BSD
Index: manual 'installing / operating 2.9BSD' / March 1984

Description:
 section 5.5 'Compiling the kernel' should add:

Autoconfig and ps will not work if file booted from is not named "/unix" .
Before booting a new kernel, do 'mv /unix /unix.old ; mv unix /unix' .

An overlay of size 0 is not checked for by checksys, but will not boot.
Look at the output of 'size unix' , check that the number of overlays
matches the number in Makefile.

 Section 3.3 'Editing system-dependant configuration files' should add:

dmesg : if /usr/adm/msgbuf does not exist, it is not created.
As a result, every 15 min, a new copy of old messages is appended
to /usr/adm/messages .

 Section 4 'Setting up the /usr file system' should warn:

Some sources cannot be retrieved selectively from the distributed tar tape.
For example many files under /usr/src are links to files under /usr/net .
