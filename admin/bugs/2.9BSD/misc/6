Subject: Request to be added to mail list
Index: misc 2.9BSD

	Would you please add our site name to your mailing list of 2.9 bsd
bugs?  Also, we need updates on all past bug fixes, especially for /etc/init
/etc/reboot, and any new additions to the 'ts' driver in /usr/src/sys/dev/ts.c.

	We only have the 1st distribution tape, and need to know when the next
one will be sent out.  Thank you for putting us on the mailing list and
send us ALL (if possible) the fixes since September.  If this seems feasible
could you call or send a note via UUCP that the fixes are on their way?

Thank you very much,
