Subject: Can't compile notes.
Index: 	new/notes 2.9BSD
Apparently-To: ucbvax!2bsd-bugs

Description:
	When trying to compile the notes system, it bombs out compiling
recsio.c with the following message:
	rescio.c:38:DIR undefined func. init
	rescio.c:38: dir undefined func. init

after examining, two other files reference DIR, they are archiver.c and
nfrec.c.  Also, opendir(), readdir(), and closedir() are undefined.

Repeat-By:
	type:
	cd /usr/src/notes
	make -f Ovmakefile base boot (we are on an 11/23 with floating point).

	it whirrrs away for awhile and finally bombs out, as above.
Fix:
	I believe all of these things are defined in dir.h, which is a file
that wasn't included with our distribution.  Can you forward this file to
me?  Is this the only problem?

		Thanks,
