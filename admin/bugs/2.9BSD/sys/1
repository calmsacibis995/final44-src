Subject: symbolic link system calls not compiled in
Index: 	sys/sys/sysent.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	Even if UCB_SYMLINKS is defined, the system calls will not work
	unless UCB_NET is also defined.
Repeat-By:
	Compile the kernel with UCB_SYMLINKS.
Fix:
	In sysent.c, remove the #ifdef UCB_NET/ #endif in the syslocal
	table (the #ifdef's before have already take care of things).
