Subject: Symbolic links won't work if UCB_NET not defined
Index: 	sys/sys/sysent.c 2.9BSD
Apparently-To: 2bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Description:
	ln -s (anything) 

	complains about invalid argument

Repeat-By:
	In a kernel with UCB_SYMLINKS defined without UCB_NET,
	try:
	       ln -s /usr/include/whoami.h test.h

	will fail with:

		invalid argument: /usr/include/whoami.h
Fix:
	At approximatly line 270 of the file sysent.c, the lower half
	of the local system calls are inclosed by a ifdef UCB_NET.  The
	problem is that readlink() and symlink() are also included in
	this block.

	Change the line:

		#indef UCB_NET

	to:

		#if defined(UCB_NET) || defined(UCB_SYMLINKS)
