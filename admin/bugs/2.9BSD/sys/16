Subject: Select bug in 2.9

Subject: Select timeouts broken

Index:	sys/sys/sysent.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	Select calls with timeouts will return immediantly if the timeout
	period is less than 65535.  The low word of the timeout duration
	argument to the system call (a long), is not being copied out
	of user space.

Repeat-By:
	This only matters if you have UCB_NET turned on.

	Do a select for less than < 65535 milliseconds and watch it
	return immediantly.
Fix:
	(sysent.c)
<	4, 0,	select 		/* ..... */

>	5, 0,	select 		/* ..... */

I think this should change the behavior of the network somewhat also,
since all the net daemon timeouts will really be as long
as they are supposed to be.
