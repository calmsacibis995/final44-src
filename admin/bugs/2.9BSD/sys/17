Subject: inode table full problem.
Index: 	sys 2.9BSD

Description:
	I am running an 11/23 and I keep getting this error message on the
console:

inode: table is full.

It seems to occur when our system is busy and especially when uucp or lpd is
running.  Very often I will get a couple pages worth.  Sometimes it crashes
the system.

Repeat-By:
	With 2.9 running on an 11/23 (MAXUSERS set to 3), try sending a couple
long files over uucp and at the same time send a couple of long files to lpr.
Now try compiling, or something.  Almost inevitably, you will get pages of
the messages (this is a drastic way to have the problem occur, it will
occur sometimes with less drastic measures).
