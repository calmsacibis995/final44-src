Subject: Socket header files missing
Index: 	sys/sys/socket.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	The header files used in the socket subroutines are missing from
	the 2.9 distribution tape we recieved. Consequently, it is impossible
	to make a kernel with the network software included. The files that
	were missing are: mbuf.h, socket.h, protosw.h

Repeat-By:
	Turn on UCB_NET in localopts.h
	make unix

Fix:
	Could you uucp-mail me the following header files that were missing
	from our distribution tape? (my uucp address is at the foot of this
	letter)

		/usr/include/sys/mbuf.h
		/usr/include/sys/socket.h
		/usr/include/sys/protosw.h
