Subject: rl probe routine doesn't interrupt
Index: 	sys/autoconfig/uprobe1.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	We have rl01's, but autoconfig doesn't configure them.
Repeat-By:
	Boot our system.  You will get a message like:
		"rl 0 didn't interrupt"
Fix:
	For some reason, the RL_GETSTATUS command does not generate
	an interrupt (this command is also known to be flakey in other
	contexts and can often return an incorrect value).
	
	The fix is simple.  Replace RL_GETSTATUS with RL_NOP (this is
	what 4.2 bsd uses, by the way).  So the line in uprobe1.c/rlprobe()
	now reads:
		stuff(RL_NOP | RL_IE, (&(addr->rlcs)));
