Subject: misspellings in bad sector forwarding drivers
Index: 	sys/{hp,rm,xp}.badsect.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	The three disk drivers doing bad sector forwarding won't compile.
	They all make reference to HP_DRY instead of HP_RDY.
Repeat-By:
	Look at the source.
Fix:
	Change HP_DRY to HP_RDY in three places:

		hp.badsect.c line 534
		rm.badsect.c line 593
		xp.badsect.c line 691
