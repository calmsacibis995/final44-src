Subject: ptys and VIRUS_VFORK
Subject: The pty driver wouldn't compile if VIRUS_VFORK wasn't defined
Index:	sys/dev/pty.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	The pty driver assumes that VIRUS_FORK is defined and tests for a
	constant that it couldn't find.
Repeat-By:
	Don't define VIRUS_VFORK when making a kernel with UCB_NET defined.
Fix:
	The lower half is the fix.
