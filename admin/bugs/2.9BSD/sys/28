Subject: /boot will not autoboot even with UCB_AUTOBOOT defined.
Index: 	sys/stand/bootstrap/boot.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	As delivered, /boot will not perform autoboot, even when
	UCB_AUTOBOOT has been defined in /usr/include/sys/localopts.h.
	Even when recompiled and reinstalled as /boot, it will continue
	to ask for the system to use and reboot Unix single-user.

	/usr/src/sys/stand/bootstrap/boot.c - the source for the C code of
	/boot - contains an #ifdef for UCB_AUTOBOOT to test the bootflags
	passed in high memory, and a #else to always set the flags to
	prompt for the file to boot and come up single-user.
	However, it never #includes /usr/include/sys/localopts.h to
	allow the possible definition of UCB_AUTOBOOT.  

Repeat-By:
	Define UCB_AUTOBOOT in localopts.h, and bootdev = <correct device>
	in your system configuration file.  Rebuild /unix, /boot, and the
	bootblock.  run /etc/reboot, and /boot will always prompt (with a
	": " for the system, and it will always come up single-user.
Fix:
	Add the line 
	#include <sys/localopts.h> 
	to /usr/src/sys/stand/bootstrap/boot.c and remake /boot.
