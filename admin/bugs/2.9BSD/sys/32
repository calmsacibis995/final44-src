Subject: symlink bug
Index: sys/sys3.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	Symlink() always creates a link to "something", even if the original
	file doesn't exist.

Repeat-By:
	link -s xxx xxx (or write a program that uses "symlink()".
	[Fortunately, nothing "fatal" happens.  Attempts to look at the
	file give EWOULDBLOCK errors.]

Fix:
	In sys/sys3.c, function symlink(), after the line

		uap = (struct a *)u.u_ap;

	add

		ip = namei(uchar, LOOKUP, 1);
		if (ip == NULL)
			return;

	This is the exact same way link() does it in sys/sys2.c.
