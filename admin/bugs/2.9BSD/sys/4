Subject: Can't get UCB_AUTOBOOT to work
Index: sys 2.9BSD

/etc/reboot was causing the processor to halt on our 2.9BSD PDP 11/44 Unix
system.  I found that the arguments passed to the reboot system call as
defined in reboot(2) were backwards.  Changing them only caused the system
to intermittently and seemed to ignore the /etc/reboot flags passed.
Do you have a fix for this program and whatever others are involved?

Thank you,
