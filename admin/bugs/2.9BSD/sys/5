Subject: Reboot system call halts the system
Index: sys 2.9BSD

To: 2bsd-bugs
Subject: Can't get UCB_AUTOBOOT to work

	/etc/reboot was causing the processor to halt on our 2.9BSD
PDP 11/44 Unix system.  I found that the arguments passed to the
reboot system call as defined in reboot(2) were backwards.  The reboot
call seemed to ignore the flags passed to /etc/reboot.  After a 'panic:',
when the system should reboot, it just halts the processor.
	Do you have a fix for this program and others
which are involved?

Thank you,
