Subject: Incorrect size specified for RM05 disks
Index: sys 2.9BSD

The procedure (Installing/Operating 2.9BSD - Bootstrapping, March 26,
1984 page 7) gives a root file system size of 5168.  The correct size
is 4560.  This size can be computed from the device man page (xp(4))
and the tables used by the driver(9120/2=4560).  The other sizes appear
correct.
