Subject: lastcomm doesn't work if UCB_LOGIN defined
Index:	ucb/lastcomm.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	If you define UCB_LOGIN, lastcomm  fails to read /usr/adm/acct
	properly. Also reads slowly, i.e. the buffer could be increased.
Repeat-By:
	Define UCB_LOGIN, run lastcomm (doesn't work), recompile it and try to
	run it again.  Still no go.
	
Fix:
	I am not sure this is the best or fastest but it works if UCB_LOGIN
	is not define also.  I am also open for suggestions on optimizing
	reading of /usr/adm/acct.
