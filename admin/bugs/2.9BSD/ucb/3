Subject: Problem in "lastcomm" 
Index: 	ucb/lastcomm.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	lastcomm.c does not include <sys/localopts.h>, even though other
	.h files it includes references to symbols defined therein. 
	In particular, <sys/acct.h> has a #ifdef UCB_LOGIN around part
	of the declaration of the acct struct.
Repeat-By:
	Looking at lastcomm.c
Fix:
	Put "#include <localopts.h>" after "#include <stdio.h>" in
	lastcomm.c
