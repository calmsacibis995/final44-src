Subject: "lpd" failed to print files queued before system reboot
Index: 	ucb/lpr/src/lpd.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	If any files were queued to print at the time the system went
	down, when the system came up large numbers of messages of the
	general form "lpd: daemon file (df12345) open failure <errno=13>"
	would appear in the error file until the daemon was killed.
	Restarting the daemon didn't help.
Repeat-By:
	Queue some files, and before they all print, bring the system
	down (or just kill the daemon), and bring it back up again,
	restarting the daemon with /etc/lpdrestart (as in /etc/rc).
Fix:
	The problem is that lpd runs as whatever group it's started
	with (usually sys, from /etc/lpdrestart).  Lpr is setgid to
	"daemon", and if no lpd is running, and lpr spawns an lpd, that
	lpd also runs as group "daemon".  Lpr creates files with ownership
	of the owner running lpr, and group ownership "daemon", mode 640.
	In the cases that "lpd" is running group != "daemon", it can't
	open the queued files for reading.  The fix is to have lpd
	do a setgid to the "daemon" group just before it does the setuid
	to the "daemon" userid, to insure it runs uid=daemon, gid=daemon.
