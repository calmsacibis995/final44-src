Subject: w command gets segmentation violation
Index: 	ucb/w 2.9BSD

Description:
	The w command will ocasionally get a segmentation violation.
Repeat-By:
	Happens randomly.  Seems to depend on exact state of process
	tables.
Fix:
	Skip ZOMB processes to avoid segmentation violation.
	At line 459:
		/* decide if it's an interesting process */
	!	if (mproc.p_stat==0 || mproc.p_pgrp==0)
			continue;
	Change to:
		/* decide if it's an interesting process */
	+	/* Included SZOMB state to solve random abort problem */
	!	if (mproc.p_stat==0 || mproc.p_pgrp==0 || mproc.p_stat == SZOMB)
			continue;
