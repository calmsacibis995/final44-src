Subject: vi confused by "stty susp '^@'"
Index: 	ucb/ex 2.9BSD

Description:
	On our Lanpar xt52 (imitation of act-IV), thup-arrow character
	is "^Z" . Under csh, using up-arrow stops vi. When the suspend
	character is re-assigned from "^Z" to :^@", strange things happen.
	1. On startup the following messages appear: "missing lhs", followed
	  by cursor moving to line 2, followed by "'file' 37 lines" .
	2. The key BREAK and ^Z are both interpreted as up-arrow.
	3. Contrary to 'printenv', ':set all' reports the terminal type
	   to be dumb.
	The same thing happens on a ann arbor 400e .
Repeat-By:
	stty susp '^@' ; vi file
