Subject: Fixes to sendmail for PDP-11's

Index: usr.bin 2.8BSD

In bringing up sendmail for our PDP-11/44 running 2.8 BSD, I had to
make the following changes.  Since they are not machine specific, they
should probably be put into the distribution:

savemail.c:	4.1
	In returntosender(), change the argument returnto into retto
	(7 char identifier limit)

srvrsmtp.c:	4.3
	If DEBUG is defined, WizWord needs to be declared whether
	or not SMTP is defined.

headers.c:	4.3
	A call to bcopy() should be replaced by bmove() in
	chompheader().  bmove() is provided in the distribution and
	bcopy() isn't in our libc (although it probably should be)

parseaddr.c:	4.1
	a call to printav() in rewrite() was not in an #ifdef DEBUG
