Subject: Hang in 2.9 BSD uucp
Index: 	usr.bin/uucp/cico.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	(This is embarrassing, but I've forgotten just what this fixed.
	As I recall, it was a hang during uucico startup when uucico
	was in background).

Repeat-By:
	Got me -- it was a while ago, but it seems to me that just using
	an RS-232 dialer when in background was enough to do it.
Fix:
	Both 2.9 and 4.2 support the feature that causes the hang.
	Hence the section of code that deals with disabling the feature
	should be "ifdef"'ed for either 2.9 or 4.2:
