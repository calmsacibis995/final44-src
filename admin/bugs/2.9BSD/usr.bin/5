Subject: ven-tel modems don't do L-devices "chat" correctly
Index: 	usr.bin/uucp/aculib/vent.c 2.9BSD

Description:  If you have extra text after the 
	modem-type declaration in L-devices, uucico is supposed
	to use it as a "chat" script for preliminary negotiation 
	with the modem or whatever.  The ven-tel dialer module doesn't
	call the chat script subroutine, so the extra stuff in L-devices
	is ignored if the ven-tel modem is mentioned.
	
Repeat-By:
	Construct an L-devices file that tries to get through a port
	selector to a ven-tel.  No dice.
Fix:
diff -c -r1.1 vent.c
