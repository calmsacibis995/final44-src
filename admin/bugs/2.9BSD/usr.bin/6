Subject: 2.9+ uucpd leaves sockets open.
Index: 	usr.bin/uucp/uucpd.c 2.9BSD

Description:
	The uucp demon, run as a separate process, fails to close
	its handle to an accepted connection after passing it 
	to the parent.  Soon (on an 11) one runs out of space for
	socket connections.
Repeat-By:
	Run the uucpd as a separate program, poll the site from another
	TCP/IP system.  After the close, do a "netstat" on the 
	2.9 system.  You'll see that there's a hostname.uucp connection
	in CLOSE_WAIT.  Do enough of these and you'll be out of socket room.
Fix:
	Change uucpd.c so that the 2.9 code closes the file, just as 
	the 4.2 code does:
