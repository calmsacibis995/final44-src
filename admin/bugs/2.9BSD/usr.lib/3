Subject: PDP-11 sendmail fix in headers.c

Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src/headers.c	2.8BSD	Fix

Description:
	A call to bcopy() should be replaced by bmove() in
	chompheader().  bmove() is provided in the distribution and
	bcopy() isn't in our libc (although it probably should be)
Fix:
	Changed call to bcopy() by call to bmove():
