Subject: sendmail--queue.c made more general

Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src/savemail.c	2.8BSD	Fix

Description:
	Assumed new directory defines are in <sys/dir.h> always.
Fix:
	Added some #ifdefs to determine proper include file.
	Assumes SIGVTALRM only exists in 4.2 (to avoid adding
	a #define BSD4_2 or the like to conf.h)
