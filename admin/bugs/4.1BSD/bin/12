Subject:  egrep stops if reaches a protected file	

Index:	bin/grep/egrep.c   4.1BSD

Description:  
	The command egrep will stop searching through a group of 
	files for the given expression when it comes across a
	file that is protected.

Repeat-By:
	Create three files and protect one of them to be unreadable.
	Type the following, where bfile is the unreadable file:
	 	egrep expression afile bfile cfile
	You will get:
		afile: expression
		egrep: can't open bfile
	Note that egrep will never check cfile for the expression.
