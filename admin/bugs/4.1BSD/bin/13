Subject: security bug in set[gu]id files in 4.[12]BSD

Index:	bin/sh 4.1

Description:
	There is a serious security problem when using set-uid and/or
	set-gid directly-exec'able command files (i.e. those starting
	with "#!").  The problem is best demonstrated by example.
	Consider the file "/usr/local/rootdate", setuid root, containing

		#! /bin/sh
		# Run "date" as root
		date

	The following sequence is used to obtain an interactive
	setuid-root shell:

		$ ln /usr/local/rootdate /usr/tmp/-
		$ cd /usr/tmp
		$ -

	When the shell is run to process the command file its argv list
	is {"-", "-", NULL} so it assumes that it should read the standard
	input.  It also looks for the user's ".profile" file.  (The
	reading of ".cshrc" can be avoided by using "#! /bin/csh -f".)

	In 4.1BSD the problem occurs when the setuid file resides on a
	filesystem on which a user may create a link, e.g. linking from
	"/usr/local" to "/usr/tmp".  In 4.2BSD the setuid file may be
	anywhere because a symbolic link can be used.

Repeat-By:
	See above.
