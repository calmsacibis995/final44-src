Index:	bin/csh 4.1BSD Fix
Description:
	Earlier I submitted a bug report syaing that "unlimit datasize"
	and "unlimit stacksize" don't work because you get a "not owner"
	error, and I suggested that the problem should be corrected in
	the kernel, /sys/sys/kern_resource.c . This is, of course, wrong,
	and I hereby retract that particular report. I now contend that
	the semantics of the csh unlimit command should be bent a bit
	instead. Instead of trying to set the limits to RLIM_INFINITY
	I think you should set the "soft" limit (rlim_cur) to the
	"hard" limit (rlim_max).
Repeat-By:
	Type "unlimit stacksize". Watch error message appear.
Fix:
	Change csh to use rlim_max instead of RLIM_INFINITY for an
	"unlimit" or "limit xxx unlimit" command. Sorry I can't be
	more specific, but I already made the change in the kernel.
