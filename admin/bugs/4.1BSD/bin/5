Subject: 4.1c sh "not found" errors
Index: 	bin/sh/*.c 4.1BSD

Description:

	The command
		echo "see /dev/null; see /dev/null" | sh
	usually says
		sh: see: not found

	In other words, the first "see" is not found, but the second one is.
	The diffs from 4.1 to 4.1c "sh" show only very minor changes, each of
	which I have twiddled without very encouraging results.

	Anybody out there fixed this problem yet?

Repeat-By:
	echo "see /dev/null; see /dev/null" | sh
