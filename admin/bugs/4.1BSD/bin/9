Index: bin/ps 4.1BSD
It appears to me that the virtual size given by ps under 4.1c
Unix is twice as large as it should be.  When Crystal is running,
ps claims that it has more than 9000 virtual blocks.  I went in
with sdb and was unable to find more than about 4.5 Mbyte of
stuff in the program.  Could it be that an extra factor of two
slipped in during 4.1c conversion?  The problem doesn't seem to
exist in 4.1a.
