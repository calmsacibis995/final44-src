Subject: Fsck fixes for Unix domain sockets
To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Index: etc/fsck.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:

	Fsck should remove sockets during preen mode.  When
	the system has crashed because Unix mode sockets
	have been used (see another bug/fix report),  the
	system comes up single user because fsck is nervous
	about socket inodes.  This problem has been observed
	on 4.1c Vax systems and SUN 0.3/0.4 systems.
	
	These fixes were developed with support from IBM.

Repeat-By:

	Attempt almost any operation with a Unix domain
	socket,  and observe the system trying to re-boot.
	The test programs in my submission about Unix
	domain sockets will cause the problem.

Fix:

What follows is a diff against the 2.22 version of
/usr/src/etc/fsck.c dated 3/8/83.
