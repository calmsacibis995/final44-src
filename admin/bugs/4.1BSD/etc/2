Subject: "restor ts 3" extracts files -- 4.1c
To: teklabs!ucbvax!4bsd-bugs

Index:	etc/restor/restor.c  4.1BSD

Description:
	The command "restor ts 3" extracts files, instead of just
	giving a listing.  It is the "s" key that causes this behavior;
	manually skipping to file 3 ("mt fsf 2") followed by "restor t"
	does not extract files, which is correct.

Repeat-By:
	Get into an empty directory -- Warning: this will extract files
	from the tape into this directory.  With something like the 4.2
	distribution tape mounted (because it has a dump(8) file on
	file 3) give the command "restor ts 3".  You will get a listing
	as expected, but it will also extract the files into the current
	directory.
