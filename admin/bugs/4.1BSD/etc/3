	Do you still have anything to do with the Berkeley termcap?
	If not, could you point me at someone?
	
	The question is, in the 4.1bsd termcap. The cs entry for the
	vt100 is 
	
		cs=\E[%i%d;%dr
	while in 4.1C it is
		cs=\E[%r%i%d;%dr
	
	The 4.1c entry doesnot seem to work.
	
	Any idea why it was changed? Or are we using tgoto wrong?

	Somebody added a %r to the vt100 cs termcap entry.
	It should not be there - the cs entry is defined by the vt100.
	
Repeat-By:
	Look at /etc/termcap's vt100's cs entry.
Fix:
	Take out the %r.  It shouldn't be there.
