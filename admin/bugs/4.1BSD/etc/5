Subject: error in dump program
Index:	etc/dump/dumpoptr.c 4.1BSD  Fix

Description:
	the dump program searches the file /etc/fstab to translate
	file system names into device names.  when one file system
	name happens to be the same as a prefix of another file
	system name, dump may select the wrong device!
	the dump program then dumps the wrong file system.
Repeat-By:
	create one file system called "l1" and a second file system
	named "l1backup".  make the appropriate entries in fstab
	with the "l1" entry occuring after the "l1backup" entry.
	now issue the command:
	dump 0u l1
	the device on which l1backup is mounted will be dumped.
Fix:
	the file dumpoptr.c contains the proceedure which searches
	the fstab entries for the desired named file system.
	during the search, it uses strncmp to look for a match
	checking no more than strlen(filesystemname) characters.
	thus, it never bothers to match the NULL at the end of the
	filesystemname string with the NULL which must also be present
	in the name contained in the fstab entry.  
	to correct the problem, one more character must be checked.

	the statement

	keylength = min(strlen(key), sizeof (dt->fs_file));

	should be changed to

	keylength = min(strlen(key)+1, sizeof (dt->fs_file));
