Subject: page mode in tty driver
Index: ideas 4.1BSD Fix
Message-Id: <8304192054.AA01561@UCBVAX.ARPA>

Description:
	I have some fairly simple changes to the 4.1BSD tty driver that put
	page mode (e.g. a subset of the "more" command) into the tty driver.
	They come from CCA originally.  This code allows the user to turn on
	page mode (and specify the screen size) so that the screen freezes
	(like ^S) after n-1 lines of continuous output with no input.  It's
	been in use on at least 4 systems now (cbosgd, cca, utah-cs, and fortune)
	for several months now and is working very solidly.

	The changes are all ifdeffed and should be very easy to put in.
	I would like you to buy this back in 4.2BSD.

Repeat-By:
	Nothing here.

Fix:
	I can send you appropriate mods to some files in /sys/dev/*.c plus
	a new routine for /sys/sys/prim.c.  Also a change to stty is needed
	to set and display this bit.  No other software is affected - when
	in RAW or CBREAK mode page mode is automatically disabled.
