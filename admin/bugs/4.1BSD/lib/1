Subject:  getwd gets confused by soft links

Index:	lib/libc/gen/getwd.c 4.1BSD Fix
Description:
	If you have a soft link pointing at a directory on which you
	mount a file system, getwd will often return a path starting
	at that link, rather than at the real directory.
	(Well, hey, our users got confused!)
Repeat-By:
	Make a soft link in / which points at a directory on which a file
	system is mounted. Cd to a subdirectory in the file system, and
	do a pwd.  Note: this happens only if the soft link happened to
	get into the directory earlier than the real directory name (or
	maybe it's the inode being smaller).
Fix:
	Use "lstat" instead of "stat" in getwd.c .
