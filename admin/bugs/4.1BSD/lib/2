Subject:  c2 eats symbols erroneously

Index: lib/c2 4.1BSD

Description:
	/lib/c2 will, in certain cases (which the compiler never
	generates by itself, it seems) eat labels that are needed.
	A program which demonstrates the bug is in the repeat-by.

Repeat-By:
	main () {
		register int i = 100000;

		while (--i >= 0)
			asm ("jsb foo");
		exit (0);
	}

	foo () {
		/*
		 * The symbol L22: is eaten by c2, even though it is
		 * being used by the jbr generated at the top of the
		 * function (the one for getting stack space).
		 */

		/* asm ("L22:");		/* get around c2 bug */

		asm ("foo:.globl foo");
		asm ("rsb");
	}
