Subject: bug in popen()

Index:	lib/libc/gen/popen.c  4.1BSD  Fix

Description:
	Popen() unconditionally dup2's the child's end of the pipe
	after forking. It then closes the original. If the fd was
	already correct, it ends up with NO fd!

Repeat-By:
	Run the following with & without an arg.
	#include <stdio.h>
	main(argc)
	{
		if (argc < 2)
			close(0);
		fprintf(popen("/bin/cat", "w"), "hello cat\n");
	}

Fix:
	diff /usr/src/lib/libc/gen/popen.c fixed/popen.c
	24,25c24,27
	< 		dup2(hisside, tst(0, 1));
	< 		close(hisside);
	---
	> 		if (hisside != tst(0, 1)) {
	> 			dup2(hisside, tst(0, 1));
	> 			close(hisside);
	> 		}
