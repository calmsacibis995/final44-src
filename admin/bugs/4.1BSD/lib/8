Index: lib/getitimer(2) 4.1BSD
Description:
	The default handling for realtime alarm clock signals is to kill
	the program.  This means that a scheduling delay can prevent a
	process from resetting the signal handling routine and hence
	that a process using the realtime clock has some non-zero chance
	of being killed "at random" by the system.
Fix:
	Default for alarm clock signals should be "ignored"
	Or, don't reset them when caught.
