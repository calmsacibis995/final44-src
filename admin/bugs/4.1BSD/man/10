Subject: manual inconsistency about socket() and friends
Index: man/man2/socket.2 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	There is inconsistency about the socket() sys call between the
4.1c UPM, the 4.2bsd System Manual, and the 4.2bsd IPC Primer. The UPM
and IPC claim socket has 3 arguments; the SM claims 4, and neither is a
proper sub-/super-set of the other.

	The UPM entry also references a non-existent manual page
"socketopt(2)". 

	The IPC Primer doesn't indicate any way to set options on a
socket.

Repeat-by:
	Read the manuals.

Fix:
	Apparently the socket() call now has three arguments; the four
argument version is from 4.1a. It would also seem that the calls
"getsockopt()" and "setsockopt()" exist. These all need to be
documented.
