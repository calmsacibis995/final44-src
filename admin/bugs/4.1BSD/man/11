Subject: 750 boot procedure

Index:	man/reboot.8 4.1BSD

Description:
	The boot procedure for the 750 does not document what the various
	positions of the "reboot action" and "boot device" switches mean.
	From experience, boot device D seems to boot from disk, and one
	reboot action causes a normal reboot; another causes it to attempt
	to dump core to disk first.  But I can't find this documented
	anywhere.  Savecore(8) and reboot(8) (which apparently have not
	been updated since 4.1, according to their dates) claim a copy is
	taken automatically from the end of the swap area, no mention of
	the role of the switches in this.  Presumably there is some similar
	control on a 730 and 780.

	In a related problem, whenever I try to take a dump, I get messages
	about dumping to a negative location on a decice.  I suspect what
	is happening is that the dump routine has the size of the paging
	area hardwired in instead of taking it from *swap.o.  We have
	cut the size of the paging area in half (having found that most of
	it is never used) and this is the only ill effect so far.

	2 or 3 times I've found that the system has "gone away" and doesn't
	respond, although it will continue to echo characters.  It appears
	to be related to the disk - any given port goes away after you ask
	it to touch the disk.  But I can't reproduce it and so far haven't
	gotten any dumps.  (The problem is rare enough not to be a problem,
	and it might even be a hardware problem here.)
