Subject: Command naming convention in man pages -- 4.2

Index:	man/man?/*  4.1BSD  Fix

Description:
	In nearly all manual pages, when a command or subroutine
	name is given at the beginning of a sentence, its first
	letter is in upper case.  Since Unix is case-sensitive,
	giving the correct command or subroutine name should take
	precedence over "thou shalt capitalize the first word of
	a sentence".
Repeat-By:
	Refer to nearly any man page; look for a command or
	subroutine name at the beginning of a sentence.
Fix:
	Establish a standard for this; edit all man pages.
