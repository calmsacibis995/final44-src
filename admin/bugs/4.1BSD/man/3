Subject: ctype(3) inconsistency
Reply-To: sjk@SRIJOYCE
Index: 	man/man3/ctype.h 4.1BSD

Description:
	The manual claims that "isprint" includes space ...

	isprint        c is a printing character, code 040(8)
		       (space) through 0176 (tilde)

	But the macro definition doesn't include space ...

	#define isprint(c)	((_ctype_+1)[c]&(_P|_U|_L|_N))

Repeat-By:
	Obvious.
Fix:
	Change the macro or change the manual, probably the latter.
