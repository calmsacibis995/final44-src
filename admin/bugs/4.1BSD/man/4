Index: man/man0/changes  4.1BSD  Fix

Description:
	The version of /usr/man/man0/changes that was distributed
	with 4.1c (as of Feb 13 01:11) seems to have regressed to
	a version that contains errors that were not in the version
	distributed with 4.1 (as of Sep 1981).

Repeat-By:
	Do a diff between the version distributed with 4.1 and that
	recently distributed with 4.1c.  Many typos, etc. are back
	in the 4.1c version.
	The two versions can readily be distinguished as follows:
	4.1 (good) version contains the string "Understand".
	4.1c (bad) version contains "versteht".

Fix:
	Replace /usr/man/man0/changes with the version distributed
	with 4.1 circa Sep 1981.

Description:
	CORRECTION -- I submitted a report in which I incorrectly
	identified this file as "changes" and not "changes.4-81".
	My apologies for this mistake.

	The version of /usr/man/man0/changes.4-81 that was distributed
	with 4.1c (as of Feb 13 01:11) seems to have regressed to
	a version that contains errors that were not in the version
	distributed with 4.1 (as of Sep 1981).

Repeat-By:
	Do a diff between the version distributed with 4.1 and that
	recently distributed with 4.1c.  Many typos, etc. are back
	in the 4.1c version.
	The two versions can readily be distinguished as follows:
	4.1 (good) version contains the string "Understand".
	4.1c (bad) version contains "versteht".

Fix:
	Replace /usr/man/man0/changes.4-81 with the version distributed
	with 4.1 circa Sep 1981.
