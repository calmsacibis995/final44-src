Subject: select/setitimer

Index:	man/{select,getitimer,setitimer}.2 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	The documentation for select and getitimer should cross reference
	each other in the SEE ALSO section.  There should be a
	/usr/man/man2/setitimer.2 which is a link to or sources getitimer.2.
Repeat-By:
	whereis setitimer
	shows no manual page
Fix:
	As in Description.  These two system calls have very similar
	function - in fact, I was using select to do what setitimer
	was designed for (a sub-second-resolution sleep).  They ought
	to cross reference each other.

	I trust you'll also fix the bugs Steve Bellovin pointed out in
	setitimer.  The documentation forgets to mention the first
	argument; also, setting it to zero to turn it off doesn't work.

	It's ironic that, even though setitimer was designed to be used
	as a timer and select wasn't, it's more convenient to use select
	because you don't have to mess with alarms.  Too bad select returns
	too soon.
