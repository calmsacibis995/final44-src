Subject: getitimer man page awful
Index: man/man2/getitimer.2 4.1BSD Fix
From: Chris Kent <kent@BERKELEY>

Description:
	This manual page is awful. The timer value description is
	out of date (itimer_{value,interva;} don't exist!), and
	the difference between a "value" and an "interval" isn't
	explained.

Repeat-By:
	Read the page.

Fix:
	Apparently, the name of the structure elements changed...
	Also, it seems that the "interval" is the automatically
	reloaded value of the timer, and the "value" is the time to 
	wait before firing once. This should be made clear.
