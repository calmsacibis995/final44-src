Subject:  getrlimit(2) man page typo

Index:	man/getrlimit.2 4.1BSD Fix
Description:
	The man page for getrlimit(2) says the name for infinity is
	RLIMIT_INFINITY, but <resource.h> has RLIM_INFINITY. Personally
	I prefer RLIMIT for consistency, but what the hell.
Repeat-By:
	N/A
Fix:
	s/RLIMIT_INFINITY/RLIM_INFINITY
