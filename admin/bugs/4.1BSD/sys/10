Subject:  4.1c improperly auto-configs RM05's

Index:	sys/vaxmba/hp.c 4.1BSD

Description:
	The unix.generic and unix kernels I generated for a 750
	with RH750 and two RM05's incorrectly identified the second
	RM05 as a CDC 9775.  Drive 0 was correctly identified.
Repeat-By:
	Boot 4.1c on a 750 with RH750 and 2 RM05's.
