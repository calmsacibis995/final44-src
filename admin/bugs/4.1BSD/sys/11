Subject:  Exclusive open lock not cleared

Index:	sys/sys 4.1BSD

Description:
	The 4.1c kernel does not properly clear the exclusive
	open lock if the file that is lock is also being held
	open by another process which has no locks on the file.
Repeat-By:
	sleep 1000 < foofile		# hold file open

	exclusively open the file and then close it
	try to exclusively open the file again, it
	will either block or return EWOULDBLOCK if you
	asked not to block.  The following program can
	be used to exclusively open the file.

	#include <sys/file.h>
	main(argc, argv)
	int	argc;
	char	**argv;
	{
		int	fd;

		if((fd = open(argv[1], FRDWR | FNBLOCK | FEXLOCK)) < 0)
			perror(argv[1]);
		else
			close(fd);
	}
