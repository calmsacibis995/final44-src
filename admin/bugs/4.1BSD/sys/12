Subject: more info on crash dumps

Index:	sys/swap*.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	This is more info on the crash dump problem.  It turns out that
	the problem was indeed caused by our reducing the paging area
	from 33440 sectors to 16000.  dumplo in swap*.c was set to
	16000 - 10*2048, which is < 0.  Thus the error message when
	attempting to get a crash dump.

	Our system has been "going away" for a few days now.  I am almost
	100% convinced it's a hardware problem with the disk.  The symptom
	is that any disk access hangs the process - typing a name at "login"
	accesses /etc/passwd, for instance.  A related problem is that the
	system sometimes goes into a state where any access to /usr/spool/uucp
	(e.g statting the dir or referencing a file in it) causes the process
	to sleep at -15 priority waiting on an address around 60000 hex.
	(The kernel namelist only goes up half that high, so I have no
	idea what it is.)  This reproduced reliably, but rebooting make it
	go away.  fsck found problems in the /usr/spool filesystem (but
	on a different inode number); also, that filesystem has been running
	short on inodes - it was down to around 200 free, and has run out
	several times in the past few days.
Repeat-By:
	n/a
Fix:
	I don't know about the crash.  However, I would like to see, in
	addition to the documentation I requested earlier, each swap*.c
	to contain a comment explaining that
		33440 - 10*2048
	is the location (in sectors) to begin the dump, and allows for
	dumping of 10 MB of memory.  Most of us could do with dumping a
	lot less memory!
