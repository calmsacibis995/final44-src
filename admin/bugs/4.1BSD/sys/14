Subject: Values returned by getrusage don't conform to documentation
Index: sys/kern_clock.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	The manual page for getrusage(2) claims that the values
	ru_ixrss, ru_idrss, ru_isrss are in kilbyte*seconds.
	Inspection of sys/kern_clock.c shows that these values
	are kept in kilobyte*ticks where a tick occurs every
	1/HZ seconds.  The kernal call `getrusage' doesn't bother
	to average these values over 1 second intervals.

	If you really intend that these values be in kilobyte*seconds
	then it is a mistake to make them integers - they should be
	float.  For quick commands with low memory requirements
	roundoff will always cause an integer value to be zero.

Repeat-By:
	Not applicable.

Fix:
	Change ru_ixrss, ru_idrss, ru_isrss to be float.  Keep
	the values internally as kilobyte*ticks but have `getrusage'
	transform them to kilbyte*seconds.  I agree its important
	to insulate programs from the underlying HZ clock rate.
