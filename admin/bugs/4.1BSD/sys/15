Subject: can't configure VAX730-only kernel
To: ucbvax!UCBARPA.4bsd-bugs
Index: sys/vax/mtpr.h 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	A system configured with only {cpu "VAX730"} in the config file,
	when compiled, results in the symbol IUR being undefined.

Repeat-By:
	Take GENERIC, delete the VAX780 and VAX750 lines, config it and
	try to compile it.

Fix:
	A quick workaround is to define VAX780 and VAX750, but this
	results in a lot of needless code being included.
	
	I haven't investigated it thoroughly, but it seems that adding
	the definition of IUR to vax/mtpr.h, #ifdef'd on VAX730. None
	of the other register definitions seem germane.
