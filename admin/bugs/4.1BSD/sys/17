Subject: <RESET> on h19 causes logout

Index: sys 4.1BSD

Description:
Ever since 4.1c came up, hitting the <SHIFT><RESET> on h19 terminals
causes the system to hang up on you.  This occurs even in local mode.
Not being able to reset one's terminal is a bug, and since it was
possible under 4.1b to reset the terminal with dying, I would
respectfully suggest it can be fixed.
		Ken

Repeat-By:
	Log in on an h19 and hit <SHIFT><RESET>.
