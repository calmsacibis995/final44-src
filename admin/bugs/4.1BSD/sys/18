Subject:  CDC 9775 partition table error
Index: 	sys/vaxmba/hp.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	(Detailed description of the problem, suggestion, or complaint)
	There is a bug in the distributed (4.1c) CDC 9775 partition table.
	The original table claims 843 cylinders, numbered 0..842, but
	the device actually only possesses 842 cylinders, numbered
	0..841.

Repeat-By:
	procedure to repeat the problem.
	Try to read the "bad block" table with bad144.
	We encountered the problem with FORMAT(8v), with
	9775 disks on a up (Emulex SC21) formatter -- it couldn't write
	the bad block table.

Fix:
	The fix to the sizes[] table is:
	1077760, 0,		/* C=cyl 0 thru 841 */

	377600,	547,		/* F=cyl 547 thru 841 */
	701440,	294,		/* G=cyl 294 thru 841 */

	Also, remember to fix the entry in /etc/disktab.
	Change the nc#843 to nc#842.

	Enjoy!
	 -Mike
