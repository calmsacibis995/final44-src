Subject: standalone bootrl compiled wrong
Index: sys/stand 4.1BSD fix
From: Chris Kent <decwrl!kent%Shasta@SU-Score>

Description:

	The Makefile entry to build bootrl is incorrect. It compiles
with confra.o instead of confrl.o; thus attempts to boot an rl11 on a
750 always yield "Unknown device".

Repeat-by:
	
	Just try to build it and boot it!

Fix:
	s/confra.o/confrl.o/
