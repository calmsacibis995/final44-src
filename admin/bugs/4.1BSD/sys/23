Subject: boot doesn't understand symbolic links
Index: sys/stand/boot.c? 4.1BSD
From: Chris Kent <kent@BERKELEY>

Description: 
	The boot program doesn't understand how to interpret symbolic
links at boot time.

Repeat-by:
	Make /vmunix a symbolic link to the actual kernel you want to
run and try to boot. Boot reports "bad format" and gives up.

	Using symbolic links is a win if you have multiple experimental
kernels around and would like to keep track of what's what, but don't
want to have ps, w, uptime, rwhod, etc. be confused.
