Subject: vmtotal() computes wrong total memory in use.

Index:	sys/vmsched.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	The t_rm and t_vm fields in the vmtotal structure are usually too big
	 (more than the total real memory on our system in the case of t_rm).
Repeat-By:
	Use adb to examine the field.
Fix:
	The problem is in routine vmtotal() (of course).  If the state
	 field of the proc structure is non-zero, then p_rssize is
	 totalled into total.t_rm.  However, if the process is a
	 zombie, p_rssize is not valid (overlapped by the times
	 structure).  Similarly, p_dsize+p_ssize are totalled into t_vm.
	 The fix is to not do this for zombies.
	 This fix has not been tested yet, but seems obvious.
