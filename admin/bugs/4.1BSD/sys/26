Subject: bug in ht driver

Index:	sys/dev/ht.c|sys/vaxmba/ht.c 4.1BSD  Fix

Description:
	There is a bug in the ht driver that causes UNSafe to be set.
	This causes a subsequent operation on ANY drive to abort.

Repeat-By:
	Attempt to open a drive not on-line. Attempt to do anything
	subsequent to that drive or any other drive.

Fix:
	Remove the following lines from ht.c:htcommand().
	I show them commented out.

/* This causes UNS to be set if !MOL, and is unnecessary!
 *	if (bp == &chtbuf[HTUNIT(bp->b_dev)] && bp->b_command == HT_SENSE) {
 *		htaddr->htcs1 = HT_SENSE|HT_GO;
 *		mbclrattn(mi);
 *	}
 */
