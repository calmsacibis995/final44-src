Subject: Fix for Interlan driver breaking after a ubareset

Index:	sys/vaxif/if_il.c 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	After a ubareset, all the packets sent by that host get thrown out
	in ilrint() with a bad type field.  Turns out that the interlan
	goes into "insert source address" mode after the ubareset.
	Evidently the CISA cmd in ilinit() does not work if the device
	is ONLINE.  From inspection of current code on monet this is
	still a problem in 4.1c.
Repeat-By:
	Issue a resuba() call.  ruptime shows all hosts up execpt for
	this one.  Etc.
Fix:
	Set it offline first in ilinit(), which is called by ilreset().
	Here's the relevant portion of ilinit().

	/*
	 * Turn off source address insertion (it's faster this way),
!	 * and set board online.  Former doesn't work if board is
+	 * already online (happens on ubareset), so we put it offline
+	 * first.
	 */

	addr->il_csr = ILC_CISA;
	while ((addr->il_csr & IL_CDONE) == 0)
		;
