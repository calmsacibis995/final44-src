Subject: TCP retransmission problem

Index:	sys 4.1BSD

Description:
	We observe from our end when testing file transfer with UCB-ARPA
	that a substantial number of spurious retransmissions occur from
	UCB-ARPA.  We suspect that the TCP retransmission timeout calculation
	at UCB-ARPA is unable to cope with faraway hosts where round-trip
	time is about 1 second.  The software should be able to cope with
	round trip times up to at least 5 seconds.
	
	Our hosts are 4-5 hops away from the ARPANET and are on our own
	long-haul net, which is why we observe this problem.  We have
	a continuing effort to make our implementations work with all others
	and are trying to wring out everyone's implementation.
Repeat-By:
	If you need a test account on one of our systems, we can provide one.
	We have a 4.1BSD with a modified UNET 2.0; we also run UNET on
	Onyx iron and DCN on various small PDP-11s.

	Please send us the correct "Index" field for reporting various network
	problems.
