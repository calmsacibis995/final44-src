Subject: Bug (?) in read in 4.1c
From: Paul Asente <asente@BERKELEY>
Index: sys 4.1BSD

The program

main()
{
	int n;

	n = read (0, 0, 32);
	printf ("Read returned %d\n", n);
	if (n == -1) perror ("Read");
}

produces

Read returned 0

when run, even with a large input file.  Shouldn't it return -1 and set
EINVAL or EFAULT or something like that?
