Subject: 4.1c dir.h problem

Index: 	sys/h/dir.h 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	There is no directory equivalent of the macro 'fileno'. This
	equivalent is needed in order to find the file descriptor
	number of a directory. The file descriptor number is needed
	so that ioctl calls can be made with directories. For example,
	if a program needs to have directories closed on an exec, it
	needs to call ioctl (fd, FIOCLEX, 0) and therefore needs to
	know the file descriptor number for the directory.

Fix:
	Add the following code to /sys/h/dir.h outside of the #ifdefs for
	the kernel :

		#define  dirno(dirp)  ((ptr)->dd_fd)
