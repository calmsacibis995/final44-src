Subject:  Another SIGCHLD botch in 4.1cBSD

Index: sys 4.1BSD

I have found another Berkeley code botch that affects System V
emulation users; the "C shell" /bin/csh has the same bug that
affected the telnet daemon, so csh users will see strange "wait"
system call behavior from the System V emulation.  Specifically,
a wait() will eat up all terminated children and report that
there are none (sounds gruesome, doesn't it) rather than return
a child PID.  This causes "make" to report "Bad WAIT status" and
"cc" to hang in an infinite loop after the C preprocessor finishes.

I have a fixed version of /bin/csh currently installed on BRL-VGR
under the name /usr/new/csh (one of the files that "chsh" lets
you change your login shell to); there was a one-line edit to
/usr/src/bin/csh/sh.exec.c (currently the edited source is in
/vld/gwyn/csh/sh.exec.c).  Instead of setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN,
it needed to be set to SIG_DFL when execing a command.

I appreciate your assistance in user-testing of the new software.
Other recently edited files you may have missed:

/usr/[35]bin/cc			# note: /usr/5bin now preferred
				# over /usr/3bin (synonyms)
/lib/cpp5
/lib/cpre
/lib/ccom5
/lib/c25
/usr/include5/*			# temporary versions

These constitute a System V C compiler (actually, /lib/ccom5 is
still the Berkeley phase at present) exclusive of "as" and "ld"
which are still Berkeley's (and are expected to remain Berkeley-
compatible even if System V versions are installed somehow).  It
is not clear yet whether the Berkeley compiler will be replaced
for non-System V users, but I suspect not.  Let them suffer!

It would also be worthwhile copying the files in /lib and /usr/lib
owned by "gwyn" (found by "cd /usr/lib; ls -l | fgrep gwyn" etc.).

Fun and games!
