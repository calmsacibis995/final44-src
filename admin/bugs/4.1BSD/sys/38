Subject: Syscall panics on 4.1

Index: sys 4.1BSD

     We have been getting "panic: syscall" on our 4.1BSD system which uses
UNET networking.  We suspect the pty handler; all dumps show init in the
process of starting or shutting down a job.  We recognize that 4.1 is a
rather dated system (we run the original 4.1 release) but would like to
know if there are any known problems that cause a syscall panic.  
     One would expect a syscall panic only if the kernel returned control
to the user with the machine state incorrect in some way.  Is there any
way to cause this by abuse of the sleep/wakeup mechanism.  Any advice
would be appreciated.

p.s.  If you guys fix this I'll tell you how to put ICMP Source Quench
handling into 4.2. jn
