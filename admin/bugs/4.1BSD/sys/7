Subject: Cryptic behaviour from chdir()/open()
Index: sys/sys/ufs_nami.c? 4.1BSD
From: Chris Kent <kent@BERKELEY>

Description:
	There seems to be a rather odd behaviour in nami. I will
describe it as best I can, but since I can only cause it to happen in a
particularly small set of circumstances, I don't fully understand it
yet.

It began when we tried to compile uucp; creat() calls to creat the
temporary files which are then linked to were failing with ENOENT. The
person working on the compile tried many things, and became suspicious
of the chdir call. He replaced
	chdir(Spool)
with
	chdir("/usr/spool/uucp/");	/* note trailing / */

and things began working again. Removing the trailing / causes things
to break. It turns out that changing 
	chdir(Spool)
to
	chdir(Spool); chdir(".");
also fixes things. Thus it would appear that some ending condition in
namei() (?) is munged.

Repeat-by:
	Simple programs work fine; I can't construct a program that
fails. However, all the uucp family programs fail in the same way. 
I have looked for aliases to chdir in uucp sources that might cause
this, but have not found anything. Similarly for creat().
