Subject: rwho/ruptime/rwhod byte order bug -- 4.1c
Date: Thu Sep  8 14:26:47 1983

Index:	ucb/netser/rwho/{ruptime.c,rwho.c,rwhod.c} 4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	The integer values in struct whod are not converted to/from
	network byte order, despite the statement that they are in
	the RWHOD(8C) manual section.  As a result, rwho information
	coming from/going to a machine with different host byte order
	is garbled.
Repeat-By:
	Execute "rwho" or "ruptime" on a SUN, and observe the
	uptime, load averages, and user login time data originating
	from a VAX.
Fix:
	I have modified versions of ruptime.c, rwho.c, and rwhod.c
	which I can send; I did not do so because I suspect this is
	a well known problem which has already been fixed.  Please
	let me know if you want copies of my fixes.
