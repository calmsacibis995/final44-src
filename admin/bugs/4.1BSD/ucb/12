Subject: Re: grep 'RE botch' error

Index:	ucb/grep 4.1BSD Fix

Description:

> There is still a bug though: while [ is a special pattern operator to grep,
> a single [ as in the example causes my 4.2BSD grep to go into a loop issuing
> the "RE botch" error over and over. So while the error message is legitimate,
> the ungraceful nonrecovery is not.

Repeat-By:
	grep \[ /etc/passwd

Fix:
	Is to "ucbgrep.c"  As usual, the trade secret status of the code
	involved precludes a clearer posting.  The fix is the addition
	conditioned on "OLDVERSION" below; it goes at the end of the
	function "compile".

		    cerror:
			fprintf(stderr, "RE error\n");
		#ifndef OLDVERSION
			exit(2);
		#endif
		}
