Subject: Bug in tail.c stdin pipe determination affecting net use

Index:	ucb/tail.c 4.1 Fix

Description:
	Check for stdin being a pipe is made before any argument file
	is reopened as fd 0, incorrectly causing tail to think its
	working on a pipe in that case.  Very irritating cause it makes
	pipe useless via rsh unless you do a kludge like
		rsh host tail file1 '</dev/null'

Repeat-By:
	arpa tail /usr/adm/messages
	It hangs.  Same tail.c on 4.1, 4.1a & c.
Fix:
	Move these two lines to after the 'if(argc>2)' clause.
	lseek(0,(long)0,1);
	piped = errno==ESPIPE;
