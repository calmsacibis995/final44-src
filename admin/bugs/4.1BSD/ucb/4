Subject: Please expand tail's teeny buffer size 

Index:	ucb/tail.c 4.1 Fix

Description:
	As distributed tail can only buffer about 4K bytes.   This is
	ridiculously small on a vax and severely limits the usefulness of
	a very useful cmd.   Make it big!  We made it about 32K but it
	could stand to be bigger.   Probably should #ifndef it on pdp11.
Repeat-By:
	tail -500 /usr/adm/shutdownlog
	Not many lines.
Fix:
#define LBIN 31745		/* was 4097 -- fjl 2/18/82 */
	or bigger, say 64K.

Also requires change to MAKE to add tail.c to the files which don't
get the -d2 Flag.
