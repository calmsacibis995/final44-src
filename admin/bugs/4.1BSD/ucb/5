Subject: argv handling bug in ruptime.c, rwho.c  4.1c

Index:	ucb/netser/rwho/{ruptime.c,rwho.c}  4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	argv handling allows 0 to be passed as an argument to
	strcmp(), which on some machines may cause a seqmentation
	fault when strcmp() tries to access *0.
Repeat-By:
	Compile code on a SUN, then invoke it with at least one
	option (so argc >= 2 on entry).  This will cause a
	USER BUS ERROR; an adb trace ($c) shows strcmp() called
	as strcmp(0, ...).
Fix:
	I can send my mods to fix this; I haven't done so because I
	suspect the problem has already been fixed.  A log of my mods
	follows:

	Fixed argument handling -- 
	    Would formerly allow null pointer to be passed to strcmp(),
		which can cause core dumps on some machines (from trying
		to access *0).
	    Now allows combined options, e.g. "-al".
