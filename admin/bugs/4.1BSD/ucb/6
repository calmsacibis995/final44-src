Subject: hostname restrictions in rwhod  4.1c

Index:	ucb/netser/rwho/rwhod.c  4.1BSD  Fix
	static char sccsid[] = "@(#)rwhod.c	4.7 82/12/24";

Description:
	Excessive restrictions on the character set allowed in a
	host name; e.g., '-' is not allowed.
Repeat-By:
	Have a network site hostname with a '-' (or any other
	punctuation) in it, e.g., "sun-one".  The rwhod daemon at
	other sites will not accept rwho/ruptime data from this site
	(when a receiving daemon is compiled and run with -DDEBUG,
	it will give "rwhod: malformed host name from %x\n" error
	messages when packets from sun-one are received).
Fix:
	The following allows what seems to be a more reasonable
	character set:

	In the routine verify() in rwhod.c:

	< 	if (!isascii(*name) || !isalnum(*name))
	< 		return (0);
	---
	> 	if ( ! isascii(*name) )
	> 		return (0);
	> 	if ( ! (isalnum(*name) || ispunct(*name)) )
	> 		return (0);
