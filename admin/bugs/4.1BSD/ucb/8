Subject: Lastcomm's documentation.

Index: ucb 4.1BSD
    The lastcomm command in 4.1c has been changed to print different info
but the manual page hasn't been changed.  It seems to be printing the
command times in minutes instead of seconds which is a mistake because
it far less informative.  It also prints F, S, X etc after the command
name without any indication of what this means.
