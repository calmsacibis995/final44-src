Subject: Bug fix -- rexecd, 4.1c

Index:  ucb/netser/misc/rexecd.c  4.1BSD Fix

Description:
	TERM is not set in the environment by rexecd, leading to
	possible remote command failure due to
	"TERM: undefined variable" error.
Repeat-By:
	I do not know how to produce this problem, but similar
	code in rshd does cause problems as follows, and presumably
	remote commands using rexecd would also:

        The following conditions must be met:
              1. root's shell on remote host is /bin/csh
              2. $TERM is referenced in ~root/.cshrc
        Then, execute any remote command using the rshd server, e.g.,
              % rsh <host> date
        or    % rcp xxx <host>:zzz
        Both will give "TERM: undefined variable" errors; the rsh will
        succeed anyway, but the rcp will fail.
Fix:
        Add setting of TERM to environment for rexecd, ala login.c:
        (setting TERM to be empty cures the problem, although this
        may not be the optimum fix)

	static char sccsid[] = "@(#)rexecd.c	4.8 83/02/21";
      
        char  username[20] = "USER=";
        char  homedir[64] = "HOME=";
        char  shell[64] = "SHELL=";
      + char  term[64] = "TERM=";
        char  *envinit[] =
      !     {homedir, shell, "PATH=:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin", term, username, 0};

NOTE:   The rshd code is similar in that it also did not set TERM;
        a separate report for rshd has been submitted.
