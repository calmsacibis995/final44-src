Subject: sdb won't properly index a static array of structures

Index: usr.bin/sdb 4.1BSD

Description:
	Sdb doesn't handle static arrays of structures properly.
	When asked to display a member of any element of such an array,
	it (incorrectly) displays the same member of the 0th element
	of the array.

	This seems only to happen if x is static; it works fine
	otherwise.  Also, indexing works OK with static arrays whose
	elements are not structures.
Repeat-By:
	Compile the following program with cc -g; run it, then invoke sdb
	on the resulting core dump and enter
		s[0].a/
		s[1].a/
		s[2].a/
		s[0].b/
		s[1].b/
		s[2].b/
	The results displayed will be the sequence 1,1,1,11,11,11.

	/* test program to demonstrate the problem */

	static struct { int a; int b; } s[50];
	main()
	{
	s[0].a=1; s[0].b=11;
	s[1].a=2; s[1].b=12;
	s[2].a=3; s[2].b=13;
	abort();
	}

	/* end of test program */

	By deleting the keyword "static" from the program and
	repeating the above procedure, you can verify that the
	problem is confined to static arrays of structures.
