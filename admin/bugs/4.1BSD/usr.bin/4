Subject: DS macro in {n,t}roff fails
Reply-To: sjk@SRIJOYCE
Index: 	usr.bin/troff/??? 4.1BSD

Description:
	Both "nroff" and "troff" bomb when they encounter a .DS macro;
	see next section for an example.  This happens on both our 4.1a
	and 4.1c systems, haven't checked on other systems except ucbarpa,
	on which it does work okay.

Repeat-By:

	Run "nroff -ms" on this small fragment, the text following the
	.DS is truncated:

	.TL
	Changes to diff3
	.PP
	.DS
	diff3 [-ex3EX] file1 file2 file3 [m1 m2]
	.DE

	Note, however, that the page trailer does print properly before
	?roff exits.
