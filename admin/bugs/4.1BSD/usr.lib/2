Subject: misspelling in dictionary

Index: usr.lib/spell 4.1BSD

at least since 4.1c came up, there are two misspellings in /usr/dict/words.
They are
	conser6ative
and
	conservadmsm	(presumably "conservatism")
I don't know if there are others, but you might consider getting the 
dictionary again, just to be sure.
