Index:	usr.lib/atrun	4.1

Description:
	a file created by at and run by atrun will not run a shell script
	specified by name rather than by contents

Repeat-By:
set up a shell script in some directory not designated in PATH in
your .login file
say "at <time a few minutes hence><return><name of script><return><control-D>.
This will create a file in /usr/spool/at ending with
	/bin/csh << 'xxFUNNYxx'
	<name of script>
		xxFUNNYxx
When the stated time arrives, nothing will happen even
if you've made sure that the script is mode 775 or greater
For reference, say "at <a few minutes hence> <name of script>".
This will create a file in /usr/spool/at ending with the
entire contents of your script, which will be run at the
stated time.
