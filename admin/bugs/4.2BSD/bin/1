Subject: if statement does not work when run from a terminal.
Index: 	bin/csh 4.2BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Description:
	Foreach, while and if statements work with no difficulty when run 
	from scripts.  However, the if statement, when run interactively,
	simply does not work, as the other functions do.
