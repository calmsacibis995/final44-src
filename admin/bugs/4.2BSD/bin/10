Subject: Bus error from tp
Index: bin/tp 4.2BSD

Description:
	I needed some files from a magtape created by tp(1) by someone
	in 1979 and got a "Bus error" when I ran "tp mt" or "tp mx".
	Recompiling and running under dbx, showed the run bombs during
	a strcpy() in subroutine encode() in source file tp1.c .  Apparently
	the subroutine had realloc'ed an array and got things wrong.
Repeat-By:
	"tp mt"  on a tape with a 100 files or so archived on it.
Fix:
	I don't really know what the program thought it was doing,
	but I got my tape to read by changing tp1.c's original
	malloc(1000) to malloc(100000) so that the array(s) didn't
	have to be realloc'ed.
