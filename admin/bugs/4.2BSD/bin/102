Subject: 4.[123]bsd mismodes temporary files (with fix)

Index: bin/sh/io.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	In creating temporary files, /bin/sh uses mode 0666.  This means that
	information in an owner-readable-only shell script may be readable by
	others when the information is copied to a temporary file.

Repeat-By:
	Creating a file named "try" that contains these lines:

		( sleep 20 ; cat ) << EOF
		The script this text is part of will be made mode 0700
		to keep this information private.
		EOF

	then executing these commands:

		umask 022
		chmod 700 try
		try & (sleep 5 ; ls -l /tmp/sh* ; cat /tmp/sh* )

	and noting that the mode of the temporary file would allow anyone to
	read the information you had sought to make unreadable by changing the
	mode of "try" (if their timing was good).

Fix:
	Here's a fix for the 4.1bsd version of "sh/io.c", conditioned on
	"OLDVERSION":

		tmpfil()
		{
			itos(serial++); movstr(numbuf,tmpnam);
		#ifdef OLDVERSION
			return(create(tmpout));
		#else
			{
				register int	fid;

				if ((fid = creat(tmpout, 0600)) < 0)
					failed(tmpout, badcreate);
				return fid;
			}
		#endif
		}
