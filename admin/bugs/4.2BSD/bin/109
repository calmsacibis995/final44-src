Subject: /bin/sh won't start if environmental variable with "." exists
Index: bin/sh 4.2BSD

Type:	bug
Priority: low

Description:
	If an environmental variable with the character '.' in it is
	created in the csh, then attempts to start up a /bin/sh will
	bomb.  This happens for /bin/sh scripts as well as trying to
	run /bin/sh directly.
