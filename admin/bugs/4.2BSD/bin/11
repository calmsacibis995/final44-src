Subject: arguments to adb :r command are damaged (4.[12]BSD)
Index: 	bin/adb/runpcs.c 4.2BSD	fix

Description:
	Arguments after the first supplied to the :r command of ADB
	have their first character dropped.
	
	(Original bug report by cmcl2!rna!dan, 30 Jan 84.)
Repeat-By:
	% adb /bin/echo
	:r abc def ghi

	should print: abc def ghi
	actually prints: abc ef hi
Fix:
	The bug is in doexec() in runpcs.c.  The body of the
	major loop is:
		throws away spaces
		copy an argument
		throws away spaces
	the problem being that the two different sets of code for
	throwing away spaces are incompatible in such a way as to
	discard one extra character each time.  My fix is to
	move some code out of the loop; by turning the do loop
	into a while loop one could get rid of a redundant test
	but I didn't bother.
	
	The same bug seems to lurk in the 4.1BSD version of adb;
	probably the same fix would work.
