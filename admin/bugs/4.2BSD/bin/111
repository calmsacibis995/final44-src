Subject: 4.?bsd lint fails to catch "(unsigned) 0x80000000 >> 1" bug (with fix)

Index:	bin/lint 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The "lint" command fails to catch a portability problem involving
	constants such as "(unsigned) 0x80000000 >> 1".
Repeat-By:
	Compile and run the one-line C language program
		main() { printf("%x\n", 0x80000000 >> (unsigned) 1); }
	on both a 4.[12]bsd system and a 4.3bsd sytem.
	Note that the 4.[12]bsd output is
		c0000000
	while the 4.3bsd output is
		40000000
	Note also that no version of lint on any system warns
	of the portability problem.
Fix:
	Here's a change to the 4.1bsd version of the function "conval" in the
	file "trees/mip.c".  The change is conditioned on "OLDVERSION".
		...
		case RS:
			i = val;
	#ifdef OLDVERSION
			p->tn.lval = p->tn.lval >> i;
	#else /* !OLDVERSION */
			if ( u ) {
				if (pflag && p->tn.lval < 0)
werror("4.2 and 4.3bsd differ on >> of unsigned constant with high bit set");
				p->tn.lval = ((unsigned) p->tn.lval) >> i;
			} else	p->tn.lval = p->tn.lval >> i;
#endif /* !OLDVERSION */
		break;
		...

The fix should indeed go in; here are the diffs to the version of "trees.c"
you sent recently:

*** OLD/trees.c	Thu Apr  9 15:33:57 1987
--- NEW/trees.c	Thu Apr  9 15:33:49 1987
***************
*** 699,706 ****

It looks as if both 4.2BSD and SVR2 mishandle
	(unsigned) 0x80000000 >> 1
(common ancestry will tell :-)) and only 4.3BSD handles it right.
Since 4.3 and SVR2 are different, my guess is that a warning is appropriate--
perhaps the warning should mention SVR2 rather than 4.2, though.
