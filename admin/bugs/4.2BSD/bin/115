Mike,

	I forgot the name of chmod earlier today, and it took some doing
to find it.  The summary line of the documentation does not mention
either access control or protection.  It just says that it changes the
"mode" of the file.  Hence apropos is not very helpful.  Perhaps
you could change the summary to be more useful.  Thanks.
