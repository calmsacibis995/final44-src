Subject: vhangup fails for tty[pq]* on 4.1a
To: ucbvax!4bsd-bugs@hpda.UUCP, bugs.4bsd@net
Index: bin 4.2BSD

A background process started from an rlogin is able to continue to
output onto its control tty after the rlogin completes; when another
rlogin session commences on that tty, it is subject to receiving as
much random trash as the prior process wishes to send.  I suspect that
this is caused by the failure of forceclose (called by vhangup (called
by init)) to revoke permissions on sockets.
