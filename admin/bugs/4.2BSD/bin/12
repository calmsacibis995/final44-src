Subject: B option of tar not as advertised
Index: bin/tar.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	I tried to extract a large tar file residing on one tape and
	placing the data directly on another.  That is I created a
	symbolic link under the name "data1" pointing to /dev/rmt1 (say)
	and then did "tar xvBf /dev/rmt5 data1" to extract the data
	without the tar header.  Unfortunately I ran out of tape because
	the output records were written in 512 byte records, wasting
	a large amount of space in interrecord gaps.
Repeat-By:
	The above experiment.
