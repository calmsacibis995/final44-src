Description:
Csh screws up when 'source'ing a file which contains an error.

To reproduce:
Find a file full of csh commands that is longer than 1024 characters (NOTE:
that is our blocksize, you may have to exceed your blocksize if it is larger).
Insert the following before the first command:

set verbose
illegalcmd

Now 'source' the file. Not surprisingly, csh reports 'illegalcmd: command not
found'. What is surprising, however, is that it then resumes 'source'ing at
character offset 1024 into the file, usually in the middle of a command.
(Hey, maybe this is an undocumented 'error recovery' feature!)

To fix:
Sorry, I don't care enough.
