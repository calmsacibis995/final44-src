Subject: Hanging when interrupting a cshell line with `command` in it.
To: bsd-bugs@UCBKIM

    I have noticed that if I try to interrupt a cshell command which
contains backquotes ``, before the command in backquotes has finished
the command hangs and ignores interrupts and ^\ and the only thing I can
do is kill the process (by hanging up or logging in to another terminal
or ~^Zing if I'm fortunate enough to be rlogged-in).
My most common examples are:
    more `ls -t`
or
    cat `which xxx`
but it happens with many others.
