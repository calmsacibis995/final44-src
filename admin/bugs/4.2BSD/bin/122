Return-Path: <rehmi.umcp-cs@UDel-Relay>
Index: bin/as 4.2BSD

When a reference is made to a register with a displacement, as in
	movc3	$6,-4(pc),0(pc)		# in Vax, copies self forward
the '0(pc)' is converted to '(pc)', which is an illegal addressing
mode for the pc. This is a rare, subtle, and forgivable bug, but
it is a bug nonetheless. O well.....
