Subject: uucp security glitch
Index: bin 4.2BSD

I sent a letter to Mark Horton, who advised me to send a letter to this address.

There's a minor security glitch in "uucp".  If any old user executes "uucico"
and asks for debugging output, they get it--and the debugging output includes
the telephone number used to call the remote machine, the login name, and the
password sent to the remote machine.  This information is in theory supposed to
be protected by being stored in the "L.sys" file which is set up to be read-only
by the "uucp user."

Thanks for your time and attention.
