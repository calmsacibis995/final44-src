Subject: system crash in dbx
Index: dbx 4.2BSD
Index: bin 4.2BSD

Description:
        Our new VAX-11/750 with L008 module crashes with a
        panic: munhash whenever dbx is used.  What is
        a panic: munhash?  Do you think the problem is due
        to the new style 750 or some other hardware problem?
        Have you seen this problem before?
Repeat-by:
        running dbx
