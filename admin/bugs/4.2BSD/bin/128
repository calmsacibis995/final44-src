Subject: Ctags doesn't get all functions
Index: bin/ctags 4.2BSD

Description:
	For some reason, ctags simply stopped looking for functions in
	mip/pftn.c in the Portable C compiler. After 'nidcl', no functions
	appear in the tags file. That is, no functions appearing after
	'nidcl' in pftn.c are listed in the tags file. There are others
	that are in alphabetical order after 'nidcl' listed in the tags,
	but only if they come before it in the source. There doesn't
	seem to be anything unusual about this point in the file pftn.c,
	except that the value returned by the function 'types' (the first
	one after 'nidcl') is specified by a macro.
Repeat-By:
	ctags /usr/src/lib/mip/pftn.c
