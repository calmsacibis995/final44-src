Subject: changes to fields in awk are lost when the record is printed.
Index: 	bin/awk/tran.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Assigning a new string value to a field variable is lost if
		print
	or
		print $0
	are used to output the new line.
Repeat-By:
	The following awk script which should print the sum of the
	first two fields in the third field does not work under
	versions of awk released after 4.1a
{
	$3 = sprintf("$%.2f", $1 + $2 )
	print
}
Fix:
	The problem is in setfval() and setsval() in tran.c. It looks
	as if string values are now initialized to EMPTY instead of
	null. Both these routines compare nval to 0 to decide
	whether or not the record requires further processing. The
	fix is to replace the comparison against 0 with a comparison
	against EMPTY.
	in setfval() and setsval() in tran.c change :

	if ((vp->tval & FLD) && vp->nval == 0)
		donerec = 0;

			to :
	if ((vp->tval & FLD) && vp->nval == EMPTY)
		donerec = 0;
