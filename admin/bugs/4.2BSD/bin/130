Subject: Several bugs found regarding tabs
From: Paul Asente <asente@BERKELEY>
Index: bin/tset 4.2BSD

The new tset checks if the terminal needs to have tabs changed to
spaces after it determines the delay for tabs.  This clobbers the delay
field.  Solution:  move the call to setdelay for tabs (dT) to after the
check for printing tabs (tgetflag("pt")).  This exists in several
places.

Both ls and more check the value of XTABS by (... & XTABS).  Since
XTABS is a 2 bit field, the correct test should be 
(... & XTABS == XTABS).
