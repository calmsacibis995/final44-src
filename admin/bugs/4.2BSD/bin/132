Subject: f77 DO-loop bug
Index: 	<f77 command> 4.2BSD
Index: 	bin 4.2BSD

Description:
	There is a bug in the f77 implementation of DO-loops.
	The following program will not produce any output,
	UNLESS it is compiled with the optimizer (i.e., the optimizer
	actually REMOVES a bug ... wow).

Repeat-By:
	c  program to demonstrate f77 do-loop bug

		i = 0
		max = 72

	c  the following loop should print the integers 1 thru 72, one per line

		do 10 i = i + 1, max
			print *, i
	10	continue

		end
