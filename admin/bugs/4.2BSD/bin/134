Subject: Terminal needs to do an intelligent tset
Index: ~terminal/guest/remote
Index: bin 4.2BSD

Description:
	Terminal doesn't do an intelligent tset -- it simply sets the terminal
type to "network", which is sort of a pain in the neck.  In particular, to log
in to a site at LLL, I need to go through arpa, where I must log in as
terminal.  Now, emacs users set their terminals to "dumb", and their .login
files understand that "dumb" means that the login is coming through an emacs
port, and sets terminal characteristics appropriately.  When this information
is lost because terminal doesn't propagate terminal characteristics across the
net, it is a real pain.
Repeat-By:
	log in as terminal.
