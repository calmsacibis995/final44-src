Subject: init bugs in 4.1absd
Index: bin/init 4.2BSD

Description:
	We had a problem with the process init which, out of blue, emitted
the message: "init: /dev/ttyxx, getty failing, sleeping" and once in a while,
init logged the operator off the system.  We tried to fix the problem, however
couldn't t find the bug.  Any suggestions or bug fixings for that problem from
you folks would be very much appreciated.  By the way, the op sys version we
got is 4.1absd.

P.S.:  The problems kept on happening.
