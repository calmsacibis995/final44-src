Subject: bug in more; bugs in editor, nroff/vroff
Index: bin 4.2BSD

On a terminal that has highlighting or underscoring, if a file is
viewed with  more  and the last character is underscored, the terminal
is left in an underscoring or reverse video state.  At least, this
happens with the tvi's and the Z19 that we have here, with the version
of  more  we have on these machines (brahms, cartan).  I similarly find
that when the last character of a line is underscored, the tvi will
underscore any blank spaces at the beginning of the next line.

I sent this note to John Foderaro, who said to send it to you, but
not to expect to see it corrected in my lifetime.  Oh well.

Incidentally, I also have a 257 line letter about editor bugs (and
changes in the editor that I think would be nice to have) that I just
sent Mark Horton, and a similar 831 line letter about nroff/troff
that I sent Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs a few months ago.  If you'd
like, I'll send you copies.
