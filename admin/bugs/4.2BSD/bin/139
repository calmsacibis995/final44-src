	Subject: Bug in "time" command of csh.
	    If I execute the command:
	
	time echo | lisp
	
	I only get a time reported an average of 1 out of 3 times and the
	"percentage of machine used" figure ranges from 7000% to 14000%.
	
	I have reproduced this on arpa so it isn't just a problem with Kim
	and it happens both with /bin/csh and /usr/new/csh.
