Subject: /bin/as .fill does not work

Index:	bin/as	4.2BSD

Description:
	The .fill pseudo-op fills in the requested amount of data but
	does not increment the location assignment counter on pass two,
	causing the locations (r_address) in the relocation_info table
	to be wrong.
Repeat-By:
	Assemble a program that contains a relocatable symbol after a
	.fill statement - the loader will relocate the wrong word:

		.globl	foobar
		.data	0
	here:	.fill	8,4,0
	addr:	.long	foobar

	This will result in the first longword at symbol "here" to be
	relocated by the amount that should have been added to the
	longword at symbol "addr" and the longword at "addr" will not be
	relocated at all.
Fix:
	In as/asparse.c, make the following change in the "case IFILL:"
	part:
		430,432c430,431
		< 	if (passno == 1) {
		< 		dotp->e_xvalue += fill_rep * fill_size;
		< 	} else {
		---
		> 	dotp->e_xvalue += fill_rep * fill_size;
		> 	if ( passno == 2 ) {
