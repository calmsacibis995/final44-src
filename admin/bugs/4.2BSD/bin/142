Subject: possible csh bug in 4.2
Index: bin  4.2BSD

I'm not sure if you have this one yet.

Synopsis:		quoted '*' leaves high bit on

the following command generates errors.

	% echo 'hi*'/*junk
	hi*/: Name contains byte with high-order bit set
	%

note the quoting of the first *.  You have to have both asterisks to
make this one show up.  One won't do it.

On a vanilla 4.2 csh you get "hi*/: Not Owner".
