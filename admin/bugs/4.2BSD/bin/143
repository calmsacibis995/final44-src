Subject: /usr/new/csh
Index: bin 4.2BSD

Description:
	/usr/new/csh does not expand aliases. 
	This would certainly be a nice feature, since many commands are
	always referenced by their aliases. In a class lab environment,
	students are often not even aware that they are using aliases.
Repeat-By:
	% /usr/new/csh
	% alias this_is_my_command echo good morning
	% this_is_my<ESCAPE KEY>
Fix:
	Have /usr/new/csh searh aliases first for a command pattern match.
