Subject: f77 compiler bug

The following program does not compile via the command: f77 -i2 -O program.f
	double precision dtemp,dnum
	double precision a(100)
	do 470 k=1,nm1
470	dtemp=a(2+k)*dcos(dnum*k)
	end

It DOES compile under the command: f77 -i2 program.f
or under the command: f77 -O program.f

By the way, it is not my program.  I am NOT guilty of such lack of
taste as to use f77 with the i2 switch, indicating backwards compatability
with vintage 1960 software...
