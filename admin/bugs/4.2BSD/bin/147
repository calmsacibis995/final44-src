Subject: Bug in ftp daemon rename cmd, 4.1c
Index: bin 4.2BSD

If the file to be renamed doesn't exist, the appropriate error reply is
sent to the user ftp.  Then, the next cmd sent to the daemon will cause
an error.  This is because of an error in the yacc grammar:
	rename_cmd  ::= rename_from rename_to
	rename_from ::= RNFR check_login SP pathname CRLF
	rename_to   ::= RNTO SP pathname CRLF
	rename_to   ::= EPSILON    /* needs adding			*/

When the bad pathname causes the rename cmd to abort (and no RNTO sent),
the rename_cmd production is not fulfilled.  Thus, an epsilon production
is needed for rename_to.  It should set $$ = 0 as the attribute to
the rename_to epsilon production.  Since the rename_from failed, it returns
a 0 also ($$ = (int)from).  So, one last change was necessary.  This one
is in rename_cmd.  The renamecmd will be called if $1 and $2 are set.  On
a failure of rename_from, $1 is 0, and it will give a Bad sequence reply.
Making this 'else' clause into 'else if ($1)' will mean that only a valid
rename_from can elicit the Bad sequence message.  The ftp cmd that causes
the epsilon production to reduce to rename_to will not give any reply
and go back to parsing at the cmd level.

rename_cmd:	rename_from rename_to
	= {
		if ($1 && $2)
			renamecmd($1, $2);
		else /* make this 'else if ($1)'			*/
			reply(503, "Badd sequence of commands.");
		.....

rename_to:	RNTO SP pathname CRLF
	= {
		$$ = $3;
	}
	/* this is the epsilon production needed			*/
	|
	= {
		$$ = 0;
	}

Note that the rename_cmd production is not fulfilled until another command
is sent to the ftp daemon which causes the reduction on the epsilon
production.  Since there will always be another command sent (at least a BYE),
this will not cause any problems.

Since this is the only nonterminal in the list of 'cmd's, this is the only
problem of this sort (meaning, USER-PASS-{ACCT} won't have this problem).
