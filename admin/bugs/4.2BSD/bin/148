Index: bin 4.2BSD

Description:	Touch won't touch zero-length files (no, not even with a
		10-foot pole).

Fix:		Since creat'ing a zero-length file doesn't update the mod
		time, you have to write a byte, rewind, read the byte,
		then do the creat. (You could unlink the file first instead,
		but that would require directory write access.)

Question:	Why not just use utime()?! Am I missing something?
