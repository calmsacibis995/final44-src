Subject: make dies after a limited number of compiles
Index: 	bin/make 4.2BSD

Description:
	Make loses track of file descriptors when making very large programs,
	and eventually a compiler will die due to an inability to open a
	temporary file - f77 seems to be the most common cause, although
	it probably bothers other compilers also.
Repeat-By:
	attempt to 'make' a program that has many subroutines in separate
	files and a command that must be exec'd (by the shell - ie has a 
	metacharacterin it) for each one.  After about 15 subroutines have 
	been compiled, the compiler will complain about inability to open 
	temp files.
Fix:
	in make/dosys.c, function doshell(), carefully vforks, then in the
	child closes all of the file descriptors and dismantles the data 
	structure built describing them.  Since it hasn't done the exec yet,
	this destroys the data structures in the parent also, while the parent 
	still has the files open.  When the parent later wants to look in the 
	same directory, it finds no entry in its data structures that says it 
	has it open, so it opens it again.... until it reaches MAXFILES

	The fix is simple - remove the call to doclose just before the exec, and
	instead in make/files.c, function srchdir(), add a fcntl( ,F_SETFD,1) on
	the open of the directory to invoke the automatic close in child on 
	exec.

	In addition, by making this same change (delete the call to doclose),
	the fork in doexec can be replaced with a vfork for efficiency.  
	(This is the last reference to doclose(), so it can be deleted too.)

	diffs follow:
