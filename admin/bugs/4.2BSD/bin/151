Mike Muuss,

Your TCP's retranmsission timer appears to optimized for connections on your
local net, and doesn't adapt itself to the real connection. While doing
some file transfers, almost every tcp segment you sent me got retransmitted,
some of them 6 to 8 times! The internet path I was using had 2 gateways
in the way, and the round trip time was about 3-4 seconds on the average.

Speaking of FTP. No matter which brl-vgr address I open the command connection
to, when I do a RETR your server FTP opens a connection on the Class C
address. Got that? If I open the FTP command connection to 128.20.1.1, your
server FTP will open the data connection from 192.5.21.6. The port numbers
are right, but my user ftp will of course be looking for something from
the 128.20.1.1. That explains why I had such bad luck with ftp a few
days ago.

More some other day.

Ed
