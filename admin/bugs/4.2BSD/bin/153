Subject: egrep
Index: bin 4.2BSD

A bug was found when we tried to use egrep on three files where one
of the files was protected.  Instead of typing an error message for
the protected file and doing egrep on the other two files, it typed
an error message and didn't do an egrep on the file after the protected
file.  It should be noted that when this was done with grep and fgrep,
the bug did not occur.

To see this bug in action, create three identical files and protect one
to be unreadable.  Then run egrep on them with the protected file in the
middle.  An example of this is as follows:

==> directory listing shows that bfile is unreadable

<1> ls -l *file					
-rw-r--r-- 1 andrea       80 Sep 22 13:19 afile
---------- 1 andrea       80 Sep 22 13:20 bfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 andrea       80 Sep 22 13:20 cfile

==> contents of 'afile' - 'bfile' and 'cfile' are the same

<2> cat afile
this is a test file
to see what happens when
egrep is used on a protected
file

==> execution of egrep command

<3> egrep this afile bfile cfile
afile:this is a test file
egrep: can't open bfile

==> execution of grep command - this is the way egrep should also work

<4> grep this afile bfile cfile
Can't open bfile
afile:this is a test file
cfile:this is a test file
<5> 


It can be seen that this is a bug with egrep since the same thing
does not happen when running grep or fgrep.  egrep should not 
stop when it comes across an unreadable file, it should continue
on to the rest of the specified files the same way grep and fgrep
work.
