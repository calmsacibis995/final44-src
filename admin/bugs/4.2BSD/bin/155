Subject: ``write'' failed to exit on ^D ^? ^\ 
Index: bin 4.2BSD

I wrote to arch on arpa from arpa.  ``w'' indicated that he
was rlogin'ed to renoir.  He did not write back.  After a couple
of lines, write did not exit with end-fo-file, interrupt, or quit.
These were just echoed on the screen.  A ``stop'' followed by a
terminate signal was necessary to get out.  This occurred on two
``write's''  Writing to myself, however, worked fine.
