Subject: ``at'' still not working
Index: bin 4.2BSD

I sent two bug reports over the last month and have gotten no
reply and no apparent fix.  Perhaps the bug reporting program
is not working -- I'll use straight mail this time.

``at'' generates the file that is sent to /usr/spool/at and cron
seems to start up /usr/lib/atrun every 15 minutes that removes the
spooled file.  However, the results never appear.  I believe that
there may be more than one error.  First, there may be problems
surrounding the fact that two shells (sh and csh) are involved.  Which
one runs the spooled file (csh would get syntax errors)?  Second,
when my command to be ``at''ed is ``date > ~/fileattime'' and
I (rather than /usr/lib/atrun) run the spooled file through ``sh''
(sh < spoolfile), ``sh'' complains that it can't create ~/fileattime.
But ``sh'' shouldn't be complaining because that input within
the spooled file is sent to /bin/csh via the ``<<'' re-direction.
This I don't understand.  By using full pathnames I have been able
to execute the spooled file correctly.  However, that same spooled
file doesn't have any effect (due to errors?) when run by /usr/lib/atrun.

thanks for the help and good luck,
