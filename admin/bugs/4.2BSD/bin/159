Subject: Security incident involving rlogin
Index: bin 4.2BSD

Description:
	A user dialed into machine (D) and then logged into a second machine
	(C) with rlogin.  Then C crashed.  The user hung up the phone.  Later
	another user dialed into D and found himself in the middle of the first
	user's account and session.  Apparently D did not terminate the session
	on loss of carrier on the dialin as it should have.
Repeat-By:
	rlogin to another machine and have it go down while you are trying
	to use it.  Then hang up the phone.
