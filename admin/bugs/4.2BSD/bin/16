Subject: opaque assembler msg from cc
Index: 	bin/cc 4.2BSD

Description:
If I have a buggy program which redefines a variable (see attached short demo)
the message comes from the assembler, referring to a line number in a file
that is deleted by cc, and NOT giving the name of the symbol in question.
This happens, with different wording, on both vax 4.2, and Sun 1.0.
The compiler should surely catch this and give a more intelligible message.
As it is, the user has to understand that "as:" means assembler, know how to
generate a .s file, rerun cc to do that, and then edit the .s file to turn the
line number into the symbol name.  Clearly not a step toward a high-level
programming language environment.

main(argc, argv)
