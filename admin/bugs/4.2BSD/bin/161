Subject: more
Index: bin/more.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The "more" command calls "stty" even when output is redirected.
	It also leaves terminals such as VT100s in "underscore mode"
	if the last printing character output is underscored.

Repeat-By:
	To reproduce the first bug, present these commands to "csh":
		stty tostop
		more /etc/passwd > /dev/null &
	and note the
		+ Stopped (tty output)
	message.

	To reproduce the second bug, hop on a VT100, present these commands
	to "csh":
		awk 'BEGIN { printf "a%c_\n", 8 ; exit }' | more
		date
	and note that all input and output is being underlined.

Fix:
	As usual, the trade secret status of the code involved precludes a
	clearer posting.  The first conditionally compiled section of code
	deals with the first bug; the second with the second.  These changes
	are for the 4.1bsd version of the program.
