Subject: csh can send bus error messages to stdout
Index: bin/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	In an interactive shell, "Bus error (core dumped)" (and
	presumably other such messages) are send to standard error.
	However, if a program called from a shell script bus errors,
	the message is sent to the script's standard output.  This
	behavior seems counterintuitive.  (I kept wondering "Where is
	that core file coming from?  There wasn't any error."
	Yes, there was.)

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Mon Jul 21 17:31:25 1986 [with annotations]
	% cat > t.c
	main() { char *t = 0; *t = 999; }
		[this provokes a bus error on most machines, VAXen
		included.  You might have to provoke it some other
		way.]
	^D
	% cc t.c
	% a.out > /dev/null
	Bus error (core dumped)			[as expected]
	% cat > t.csh
	#! /bin/csh -f
	a.out
	^D
	% chmod a+x t.csh
	% t.csh
	Bus error (core dumped)			[as expected]
	% rm core
	% t.csh > file				[no reply]
	% ls
	a.out		file		t.csh
	core		t.c		typescript
						[core file silently appears]
	% cat -n file
	     1	Bus error (core dumped)		[message went into file]
	% exit
