Subject: anonymous ftp bug report
Index: bin 4.2BSD

Doing an NLST while ftped as anonymous appears to have no effect.
(Or to be more precise it has the effect:

ftp> cd /pub/imagen
---> CWD /pub/imagen
200 CWD command okay.
ftp> pwd
---> XPWD
251 "/pub/imagen" is current directory.
ftp> mget *
---> PORT 36,18,0,204,29,93
---> NLST *
ftp>

or

ftp> cd /pub/imagen
---> CWD /pub/imagen
200 CWD command okay.
ftp> ls
---> PORT 36,18,0,204,29,96
200 PORT command okay.
---> NLST
150 Opening data connection for /bin/ls (36.18.0.204,7520) (0 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
ftp>

This makes it quite inconvenient to retrieve the contents of a
directory which has been placed in /pub/imagen for me.  Is this a bug
or a feature?  Or am I wrong about the problem?  This is a 4.2bsd
system, by the way.  Other (non-unix) systems I have used anonymous ftp
with do not have this property.  If it really is intentional, perhaps
the "restrictions apply" message upon login should state that this is a
restriction, or give a pointer to where the restrictions are spelled
out.
