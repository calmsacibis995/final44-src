Index:	bin/expr.y 4.2BSD Fix

Description:

	Subject: array bound bug in expr(1)
	Newsgroups: net.bugs.v7

	In the function ematch(), expbuf is declared with the #define'd
	constant ESIZE (= 256).  But, the function compile is called as
	follows:

		compile(p, expbuf, &expbuf[512], 0);

	The wired-in 512 should be changed to ESIZE.

	This bug is present in at least V7, System 3, and 4.1BSD.
