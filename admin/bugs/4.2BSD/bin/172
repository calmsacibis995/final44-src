Subject: awk can wait indefinitely on opened pipes.
Index: bin/awk 4.2BSD

Description:
	Awk(1) does not set file descriptors opened via popen(3) to
	close on exec. Awk calls popen() to open pipes when the "|"
	operator is specified.  Later awk closes pipes by calling pclose(3)
	which in turn calls wait(2) to synchronize its child. The wait() blocks
	indefinitely if two or more pipes have been opened. This is because
	there is more than one instance of a file descriptor
	associated with the pipe, namely the proper one and those inherited by
	subsequent pipes.
Repeat-By:
	echo anything | awk 'BEGIN{print "hi" | "cat"; print "world" | "tr"}'
	will hang in wait.
Fix: Set all opened file descriptors obtained via popen() and fopen()
	to close on exec.  This will ensure that child processes will
	not inherit unnecessary file descriptors associated with previously
	connected pipes.
