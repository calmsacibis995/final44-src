Subject: tp bus error fix
Index: bin/tp/tp1.c 4.2BSD

Description: 
	With any reasonable size tp format tape you get a bus error.
Repeat-By: 
	Mount a tp format tape with a hundred or so directory entries.
Fix: 
	Around line 180 of tp1.c change the test:

		if (nptr = realloc(nptr, 2 * size) == 0) {
	to
		if ((nptr = realloc(nptr, 2 * size)) == ((char *) 0)) {
	
	You also might want to add declarations for malloc() and realloc()
	to tp.h to keep lint happy.
