Subject: /bin/mail considers locked mailbox files unsafe.
Index: 	bin/mail.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	There is an unfortunate interaction in /bin/mail
	between safefile () and lock ();
	Safefile is called with the mailbox file not locked by this
	delivery process.
	The file may be locked by some other delivery process,
	and therefore have two links.
	Safefile demands that the file have only one link.
	
Repeat-By:
	This is triggered by simultaneous delivery of more than one
	message to the same Mailbox.

Fix:
	The cure is to lock the mailbox file before checking if it is safe,
	and changing safefile to expect exactly two links.
