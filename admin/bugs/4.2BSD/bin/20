Subject: diff -r -l doesn't work correctly
Index: bin/diff/diffdir.c 4.2BSD
From: John Romine <jromine@uci-750b>

Description:
	Diff doesn't list differences in files more than one subdirectory
	deep when using the -r & -l options.
Repeat-By:
	Run "diff -r -l d1 d2", where directories d1 and d2 have a
	subdirectory containing a file which differs.  Diff won't list it.
Fix:
	In diff/diffdir.c, routine calldiff(), add this conditional
	around the two close statements. (near line 356)
