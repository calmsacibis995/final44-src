Subject: multiple text segments
Index: bin/as 4.2BSD

Description:
	The use of multiple text segments appears to prevent jeql and similar
	instructions from being expanded correctly all the time.  It
	generates "Branch too far" messages with all conceivable assembler
	options, even when the branch and destination are clearly less than
	1K apart (and in the same segment).
Repeat-By:
	The assembly program which is known to exhibit this behaviour is
        approximately 1400 lines long, and available on request.
