Subject: tiny ``ls'' bug

Index: bin/ls 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	``ls'' has too small a field width for the inode number
	printed with the -i option.

Repeat-By:
	run ``ls -li'' on the H partition of a full RA81, in a
	directory with inode numbers > 99999.

Fix:
	Change the %5d column to a %6d column -- that should handle
	up to about a 2 gigabyte file system....  (Just for fun: at
	2048 file bytes per inode times 1,000,000 inodes => 2.048
	gigabytes, which is a little more than four and a half full
	RA81s.)
