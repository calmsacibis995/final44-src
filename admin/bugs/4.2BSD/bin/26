Subject: make won't compile if "unix" is not defined

Index: bin/make/main.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Whoever added the MFLAGS-setting code to make forgot
	several "#ifdef unix"es.  The declaration for ``op''
	is in such an ifdef, but two uses of it are not.

Repeat-By:
	inspection

Fix:
	Either make MFLAGS get set whether or not unix is defined,
	or add #ifdef unix/#endif pairs around the decrement in
	``case 'f':'' and around the code that calls setvar("MFLAGS",...).
	Also, it's not necessary to do a full-blown strcmp() before
	setting *options to '\0': just check whether op==options+1.

Chris
