Subject: In cc, large double constants are treated wrongly.

Index:	bin/cc 4.2BSD

Description:
	In cc, double constants that are larger than the maximum
	possible value generate no warning, but compile to the wrong value.

Repeat-By:
	main() {
		double x=1e100;
		printf("1e100=%g\n", x);
	}

	gives: 1e100=1.70141e+38
