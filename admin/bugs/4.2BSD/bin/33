Subject: pr can't handle a full page of data - overflows buffer
Index: 	bin/pr.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	A printer page can hold 66 lines of 132 characters.  But if you
	try to use 'pr' for that much data, it overflows it's buffer and
	screws up.
Repeat-By:
	In the following script, 'awk' creates 528 lines of 14 characters each,
	numbered from 10001 to 10528.  'pr' is used to format it and output
	it with 128 characters/line, 66 lines/page: 
		-8 => 8 column output,
		-t => no headers or trailers,
		-w128 => 128 columns wide
	The first line of output from 'pr' should begin with _________10001
	but it does not.

	#	illustrate pr bug
	awk 'BEGIN { for (i = 10001; i<=10528; i++ ) \
		print "_________" i }' < /dev/null | \
		pr -8 -t -w128
Fix:
	The buffer size currently is 6720=66*112, raise it to 9000 to
	handle a full page (it would be better to compute the size
	dynamically, but I'm satisfied with a full page).
