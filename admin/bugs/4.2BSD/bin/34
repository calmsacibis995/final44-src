Subject: diff -h incorrectly sets the exit status
Index: 	bin/diff 4.2BSD

Description:
	I get an exit status of 0 from 'diff -h' when there are differences
	I can't remember if I submitted this,
		sorry if this is the 2nd submission
Repeat-By:
	#! /bin/csh -f
	#	compare 2 unequal files
	echo 'line 1 file 1' >! /tmp/difft1
	echo 'line 1 file 2' >! /tmp/difft2
	#	diff -h => different and exit status = 0
	diff -h /tmp/difft1 /tmp/difft2
	echo $status
	#	diff    => different and exit status = 1
	diff    /tmp/difft1 /tmp/difft2
	echo $status
