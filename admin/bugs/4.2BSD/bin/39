Subject: "csh -c" thinks '#' is comment
Index: 	bin/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	csh incorrectly interprets '#' in a command argument as a comment
character if the stdin is not a tty.  

Repeat-By:
	Compare the output of
		csh -c "echo a # b"
		csh -c "echo a # b" < /dev/null
	or try
		rsh <somehost> echo a # b

Fix:
	The bug lies either in the way intty is set (in sh.c), or in the
test for comments that relies only on intty (in sh.lex.c).  I don't know
a working fix -- I tried several that had evil side effects.
