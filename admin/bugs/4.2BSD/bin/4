Index:	bin/adb/runpcs.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	doexec() strips off the 1st char of every arg after the 1st one
	before passing them to the pgm.

Repeat-By:
		adb /bin/echo
		:r foo bar zap
	yields:
		foo ar ap

Fix:
	Now if it were in C and not cpp I might have a real one.
	I just substituted our 4.1a version (sid 4.1) and it works fine.
