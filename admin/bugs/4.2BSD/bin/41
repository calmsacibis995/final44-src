Subject: improvement to 'w file' command
Index: 	bin/sed 4.2BSD

Description:
	To process the 84.2 buglist tape, I ran the makefile to
	create all the pretty printed bug reports.  To process
	the large everything file, I wrote a small sed script
	to divert everything through the first _______ line
	to a separate file 'next' and pass the rest of the file
	to standard output.  The script worked but I had to wait
	until the entire run was finished to read the file 'next'
	because the output to that file was buffered and only
	flushed at close on exit.
Repeat-By:
	The above.
Fix:
	In file sed1.c add the line

	    fflush(ipc->fcode);
	
	after the lines:

	    wcom:
	    case WCOM:
		    fprintf(ipc->fcode, "%s\n", linebuf);
