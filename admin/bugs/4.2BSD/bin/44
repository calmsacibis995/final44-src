Subject: The "exec" csh builtin leaves extra file descriptors open
Index: bin/sh.? 4.2BSD

Description:
	The last four file descriptors

Repeat-By:
	If you run the following program from csh by saying 'exec a.out',
	you will find that the last 4 file descriptors are open.
	They shouldn't be.

main ()
{
	int fd, tmpfd, nfds;

	nfds = getdtablesize();
	for (fd = 0; fd < nfds; ++fd)
		if ((tmpfd = dup(fd)) >= 0) {
			printf ("%2d open\n", fd);
			close (tmpfd);
		}
	exit (0);
}
