Subject: 'make' reading of standard input
Index: 	bin/make 4.2BSD

Description:
	All attempts to have 'make' take its input from the standard input
	failed:

	cat Makefile | make -f -       as well as     make -f - < Makefile

	while,		make -f Makefile   worked like a charm.

Repeat-By:
	As above.
Fix:	Good question.
