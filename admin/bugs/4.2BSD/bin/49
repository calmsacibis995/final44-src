Subject: rm -i is too lax
Index: 	bin/rm 4.2BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Description:
	rm -i only queries "rm: remove file?"
	If the file itself is not writable, it does not go on to
	ask "override protection 400 for file?"
Repeat-By:
	Take write permission off of a file.
	Type rm - and answer 'n' to override.
	Type rm -i and answer 'y'
	Note the absense of the question on override.
