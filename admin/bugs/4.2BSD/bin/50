Subject: tar allows absolute pathnames
Index: 	bin/tar.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When writing a tape, tar allows the user to specify the
	directory to be tar'ed as an absolute pathname.  This can make
	restoring the files difficult since they must be restored to
	exactly the same place.

	Tar should allow only relative pathnames.
