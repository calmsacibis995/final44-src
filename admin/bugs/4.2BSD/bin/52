Subject: diff bug

Subject: diff can crash if one input file is a prefix of the other
Index:	bin/diff/diffreg.c 4.2BSD

Description:
I found a bug in diff, believe it or not.  If one of the files
being compared is a prefix of the other, the sort() routine inside diff
gets called with 0 items to sort, and the code doesn't handle that case
properly: it ends up using the value of a register variable (m) without
having set it.  If the register happens to have 0 or 1 in it on entry,
diff manages to work anyway, but if there is a larger value it may
screw up or crash.

Repeat-By:
I'm not sure you can make it crash on the VAX.  Try putting a
breakpoint at sort and note that it gets called with 0 elements to
sort if either file is a prefix of the other (in terms of lines).
(That is, try creating files like this:
	% cat > file1
	a
	b
	^D
	% cat > file2
	a
	^D
and run diff on them.)
Now step through the sort() code or examine it, and note that m is used
without having been set in this case (i.e. when n=0 on entry).

Fix:
I patched it by adding the line
	if (n == 0) return;
as the first executable code in sort().
I haven't traced through the code to be certain there isn't anything
else wrong.
