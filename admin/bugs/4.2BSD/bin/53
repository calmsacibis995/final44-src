Subject:  history command in csh infinite loops on "negative" arguments
Cc: leblanc@ucbdali

Index:       bin/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	Giving the command "history -<arg>", where <arg> is anything, to the
	csh causes an infinite loop.  It can be easily interupt'ed however.
Repeat-By:
	Type the following (to the cshell):
		history -a       (anything after a "-" seems to work)
	and it hangs there.
