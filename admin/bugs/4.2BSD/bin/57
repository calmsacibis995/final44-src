Subject: adb args
Index: bin/adb/runpcs.c 4.2BSD

Subject:
	Arguments after the first supplied to the :r command of ADB
	get the first character lopped off.
Description:
	When giving more than one argument to the :r command of ADB
	the first character of each subsequent argument is dropped.
Repeat-By:
	adb /bin/echo
	:r hello this example
	/bin/echo: running
	hello his xample
	process terminated
Fix:
	Haven't had time to wade to ADB's Bourne/A68'isms. Presumably
	in runpcs.c the first character gets throw away while looking
	for io redirections.
	For now, of course, supply a extra first character to be thrown
	away.
