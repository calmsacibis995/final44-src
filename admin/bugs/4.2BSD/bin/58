Subject: bug in tar command
Index:	bin/tar.c  4.2BSD  Fix

Description:
   When /bin/tar is creating and cant enter a directory,
   it may proceed as if the chdir() had been successful,
   archiving files from the actual directory as if they
   resided in the intended directory.

Repeat-By:
   	mkdir One 
   	cd One 
   	date > two 
	mkdir Three 
   	date > Three/four 
   	chmod 000 Three 
   	tar cvf /tmp/five two Three 

Fix:
   In putfile(), immediately after learning that
   file type is IFDIR, test for enterability.
   (in tar.c sccs version 4.17, add after line 442):
	if (access(shortname, 1) < 0){
		perror(shortname);
		return;
	}
