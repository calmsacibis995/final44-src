Subject: The csh "nice" command is busted
Index: 	bin/csh/sh.time.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The "nice" command, when given a numeric argument only, sets
	the niceness of the shell to +19 because for non-superusers
	the sequence   nice(20); nice(-10);   the second nice() has no
	effect.  Even for super-users the over-all result may not be
	what is wanted if the previous niceness is negative!
Repeat-By:
	In the csh compare the result of:
		nice +3 ps gl
	with that of:
		nice +3
		ps gl
Fix:
	See the following transcript:
