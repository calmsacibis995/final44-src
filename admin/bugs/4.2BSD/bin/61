Subject: ps doesn't work with -k flag
Index: 	bin/ps.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The ps program doesn't work on kernel core image
	files (i.e. images produced by the savecore program).

Repeat-By:
	ps -axlk /usr/crash/vm{unix,core}.85

Fix:
	The -k option must have been broken since 3.0BSD, since
	there wasn't any code in ps to do virtual to physical
	address translation.  Fix was to steal vtophys() from
	adb and add to ps.  There are too many lines of diff output
	to be practical, so the revised program is in

		monet:~tef/ps.c

	Take it if you want it.
