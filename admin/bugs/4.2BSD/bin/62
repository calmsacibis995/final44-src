Description:
	The following program shows there is a problem with the
	relational operation between elements of float arrays and
	double arrays. I sent this bug report in a year ago, but
	apparently it did not reach its destination, wherever that
	may be.

Repeat-By:

	#include	<stdio.h>
	double	dd[2] =	{ 0.0, 3.0 };
	float	ff[2] =	{ 0.0, 1.0 };
	main(){
		int i=1, j=1;
		if( ff[i] >= dd[j] ) printf( "not OK\n" );
		else printf( "OK\n" );
	}
