Index:	bin/cc	4.2BSD

Description:
	according to Kernighan & Ritchie, p. 46:
	"If e1 and e2 are expressions, then
		e1 op= e2
	is equivalent to
		e1 = (e1) op (e2) "
	Similarly, see p. 191.

	However if i is an int and d is a double,
		i *= d
	is not equivalent to
		i = (i) op (d)

Repeat-By:

compile and run this program -

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
int i = 8, j;
double d = 0.8;

j = i;
printf(" %d %d\n", i, j );
j = (j) * (d);
i *= d;
printf(" %d %d\n", i, j );
}
