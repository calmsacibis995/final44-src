Subject: csh quits silently if .. isn't readable
Index: bin/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
Repeat-By:
The C shell quits silently if the parent directory (or anything back to the
root) isn't readable when it starts up (and if it isn't a login shell).  This
can happen when you su to someone who can't read your working directory; the
su fails silently.

Here's why:
The Cshell's dinit() calls getwd() (defined in /usr/src/libc/libjobs/getwd.c),
which notices the problem, writes an error message to file descriptor 2, and
exits.  However, file descriptor 2 is closed by initdesc() before getwd()
acts.  The whole thing is a mess because you're trying to be compatible with
version 5 on up with respect to file descriptors, so I daren't suggest a fix.
