I don't know if anyone's mentioned this before, but it seems to be pretty
annoying (in the sense of unexpected behavior).  The C shell says that '#'
introduces a comment (remainder of line is ignored) whenever the shell's
standard input is not a terminal, rather than when the shell is not
interactive.  As a consequence, command arguments containing '#' may screw
up when passed to 'csh -c command args ...'  I found this out the hard way
when using the spell command in Gosling's emacs.  The compile-it function
apparently calls a C shell (at least when your environment SHELL variable
says that's your shell), and my file-name would get truncated silently
UNLESS I did an interactive compile-it.

It really seems that comments should be recognized only in non-interactive
shells which aren't started with '-c'.  Does anyone have a reason not to
do this?
