Index: bin/login.c 4.2BSD

In /usr/src/cmd/login.c, check the 2nd instance of TIOCLSET.
(The first is an ifdef, the second is an ioctl.)  In my copy (which
I think has not changed in that part from 4.1BSD) the 3rd parm passed
to the ioctl is 0.  It should be a pointer to a location containing 0.
The symptom of this was than when I made another change to login,
suddenly several bits (nohang, etxack, and intrup) were getting set
when people logged in, and nohang caused the system not to send SIGHUP
when they logged out.

We are still having a similar problem on our dialup - the process
doesn't get a SIGHUP (nor does the DZ notice that carrier is gone)
until the next person dials up.  Our dialup is a VENTEL 212+ and I
suspect that the dialer is interactively raising carrier thinking
someone wants to dial out or some such thing.
