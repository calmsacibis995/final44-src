Subject: /bin/sh is very old

Index:	bin/sh 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The /bin/sh distributed with 4BSD is incredibly old - it's
	basically unmodified from UNIX/32V.

	I realize that nobody at Berkeley uses sh, I don't use it either.
	However, it is a good thing to put into makefiles and shell
	scripts, and there are people around (especially inside AT&T)
	who use it instead of csh, or who use the Korn shell.  There
	have been some good things put into it, for example, /etc/profile
	(a feature which csh could use too.)
Repeat-By:
	The particular bug came up when we tried to bring up the Korn
	shell on a Sun, which is 4.2 but isn't a VAX.  ksh tries to figure
	out what kind of system it's on automatically and compile itself
	accordingly with the right flags.  This results in code in the
	makefile like this:
		if test $(FIXDATA); then do one thing; else do another thing; fi
	where $FIXDATA is either the null string or "1".  On a VAX it's 1,
	so this works.  But on a Sun it's null, and when make invokes
	sh -e, if an if fails, the shell exits instead of doing one of
	the branches.  This terminates the make.
Fix:
	Just get a more recent shell.  If the next BSD is going to require
	a System V license anyway, there's no problem.  Doug Gwyn (gwyn@brl)
	has a complete System V emulation package for 4.2BSD which includes
	a ported System V shell; perhaps it's easiest to get his.
