Subject: bug in ps.c version 4.28

Index:	bin/ps.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	MAXTTYS == 256 is not always large enough,
	not so much because there this many actual ttys,
	but because ps classifies rather broadly when
	looking for ttys in /dev directory.  Diagnostic
	is "tty table overflow".  Problem doesnt occur
	when U option creates /etc/psdatabase since
	more precise classification is used.
Repeat-By:
	Find a system with 300 or so devices in /dev
	and no /etc/psdatabase file.  Then just say "ps".
Fix:
	#define MAXTTYS 512
