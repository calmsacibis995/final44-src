Subject: Division bug in  dc .
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Index:	bin/bc 4.2BSD

Description:
	In  dc , it is possible to get completely different results
	just by appending a trailing zero after a decimal fraction.

Repeat-By:
	% dc
	20k
	.0009999998 .99999950 / p	/* Wrong answer using trailing 0 */
	.00090000025000012500
	
	.0009999998 .9999995  / p	/* Right answer not using trailing 0 */
	.00100000030000015000

Fix:
	Replace  dc  with GNU's  dc .
