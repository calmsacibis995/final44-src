Subject: Code generation bug in eqn 
Index: 	bin/eqn 4.2BSD

Description:
	eqn sometimes restores the wrong font after an in-line equation.
	In particular, it restores the font to whatever font (and, I think,
	size) were in force at the end of the previous input line, rather
	than those that were in force immediately before the equation.
	In the example below, note the line break in the middle of the
	italicized phrase "Taylor series".  After the subsequent equations,
	the font is set to italic, not roman, although roman was in force
	at the time of the words "such as".

Repeat-By:
	The following eqn/troff document illustrates the problem:

.EQ
delim $$
.EN
[\f3Caution:\fP  Using $e$ in two ways:
   1.  Base of natural logs, $2.71828 ...$.
   2.  In Turing, to indicate a power of ten, \*(Eg $0.456e-12$. ]

Want approximation to the sum of an infinite series, such as a \f2Taylor
series\f1.  Way to compute many functions, such as $e sup x$, $sin ~x$, etc.
.sp 0.5
.EQ
e sup x ~=~ 1~+~x~+~x sup 2 /2!~+~x sup 3 /3!~+~...~+~x sup n /n!~+~...
.EN
.sp 0.5
Converges for all values of $x$.  But if $x$ is large, need many terms before
convergence, and numerator and denominator both huge \(em may overflow.


Fix:
	Seems to require radical surgery on eqn's code generator.
