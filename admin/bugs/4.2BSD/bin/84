Subject: C compiler does not zero fill on right shift of unsigned const

Index: 	bin/cc.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The following program demonstrates how the C compiler does not
	do zero filling of an unsigned constant
	when doing a right shift.  This bug is not in the Computer
	Center's 4.2 machines, but does appear on ucbernie.  The
	contents of an unsigned variable are shifted correctly; the
	problem seems only to affect constants.  The program

	#include <stdio.h>
	main()
	{
		unsigned u = ~1;
		printf("%o %o %o\n", u, u >> 1, ((unsigned) (~1)) >> 1);
	}

	on ucbopal produces the output

	37777777776 17777777777 17777777777

	and on ucbernie produces

	37777777776 17777777777 37777777777

Repeat-By:
	On ucbernie, do

	cd ~jak ; cc BUG.c ; a.out
