Subject: int/long confusion in ls
Index: 	bin/ls.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	There are a couple of places in ls.c where ints are assumed
	to be the same size as longs.
Repeat-By:
	Port ls.c to a 16 bit machine.
Fix:
	In formatd(), "nkb" should be a long.
	The routine getdir() should be declared as returning a long
		and referenced correctly in formatd().
	In getdir(), "nb" should be a long.
	In gstat(), "pnb" should be a pointer to a long.
