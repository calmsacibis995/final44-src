Subject: RE botch in "sed"
Index: 	bin/sed 4.2BSD

Description:
	When given certain invalid regular expressions, "sed" goes
	into an infinite loop typing "RE botch, 17".

Repeat-By:
	% ls *.c | sed 's//.c$/'	[sed 's/.c$//' was intended]

	Apparently a null regular expression with 's' is the problem.
