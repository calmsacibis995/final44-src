Subject: 4.?bsd date, ac, and wtmp(5) clash on how to change time

Index:		bin/date.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The 4.?bsd section 5 manual page for wtmp says that ". . .the
	typewriter names `|' and `}' indicate the system-maintained time
	just before and just after a date command. . ."  And the ac command
	does indeed look for these two characters.  However, the
	characters '|' and '{' are what's actually written by the date command.

Fix:
	Rather a religious issue, yes?  Perhaps "ac" should be set up to accept
	either '{' or '}', and then again perhaps not.  If "date" is doing
	things differently from System V, perhaps its behavior should be made
	to match that of System V, and then again perhaps not.  Opinions?

Is System V an AT&T Bell Laboratories trademark?
