Subject: too long filenames
Index: bin/tar.c 4.2BSD

Description:
Repair bug which left input files open when their name was to long to
allow them to be dumped.  This could ultimately result in a complete
failure of tar if too many such files were found.
Repeat-By:
	Try to tar a file with a path greater than NAMSIZ
Fix:
RCS file: RCS/tar.c,v
retrieving revision 1.1
diff -c -r1.1 tar.c
