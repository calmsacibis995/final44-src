Subject: 'as' - assembler - TNAMSIZE (max length of temporary files) too low
Index: bin/as 4.2BSD
Date: 06 Jul 85 07:23:54 EST (Sat)
From: Stephan v. Bechtolsheim <svb@Purdue.EDU>

Description:
	We had a case where we use a directory for temporary files
	like /usr/src/local/bin/xxx/tmp and that together with the
	pascal compiler which then would generate names of the form
	/usr/src/local/bin/xxx/tmp/P00000 would cause trouble
	in the assembler.

Repeat-By:
	See above.
Fix:
	Increase TNAMESIZE in as.h (we did this here and it works)
