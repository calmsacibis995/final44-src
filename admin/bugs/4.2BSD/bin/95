Subject: inews security hole

Index:		bin/inews.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The set-user-ID "inews" command opens ".signature" files when its
	effective user ID is that of the owner of the "inews" command.
	This means that
		1.  ".signature" files that are in protected home directories
		    will not be appended to articles.
		2.  unsavory users can
			ln -s some-file-only-readable-by-news-user ~/.signature
			postnews
			...
		    and end up posting an article containing information they
		    aren't supposed to be able to read.  (This is only a major
		    problem on systems where, for example, the "news" user and
		    the "uucp" user are one in the same--the above technique
		    can be used to, for example, read the "/usr/lib/uucp/L.sys"
		    file.)

Repeat-By:
	See above.

Fix:
	Change the line in the function "input" in the file "inews.c" that
	(in the 2.10.3 beta release of inews) reads:

		if (infp = fopen(bfr, "r")) {

	to read:

		if (access(bfr, 4) == 0) {
			if ((infp = fopen(bfr, "r")) == NULL) {
				(void) fprintf(stderr,
    "inews: \"%s\" left off (must be readable by \"inews\" owner)\n", bfr);
				goto finish;
			}

	And add the label "finish:" in the indicated place:

	.
	.
	.
	finish:
	(void) fclose(tmpfp);
	if (SigTrap) {
	.
	.
	.
