Subject: limit -h doesn't work in csh
Index: 	bin/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	Finding out and setting your limits to the hard limit
	does not work in csh.  csh(1) claims that
		limit -h
	will report the hard limits.  It actually generates a
	"no such limit" error message.  This is true if given
	an argument, too, e.g.,
		limit -h datasize
Repeat-By:
	type "limit -h" or "limit -h datasize" to csh.
