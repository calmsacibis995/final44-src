Subject: rm -r does not create long ( > 2048 chars) paths right.

Index: bin/rm.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description: Improper use of realloc() in precedure append().

Repeat-By: Cannot generate the error because MAXPATHLEN defined
	   by the system is < the number of bytes allocated by
	   the first call to malloc.

Fix:

	256c256
	< 		pathsz = n + 2048;
	---
	> 		pathsz = pathsz + n + 2048;

	Note: MAXPATHLEN in sys/params.h is defined as 1024.
	This makes the assignment of pathsz = n + 2048 and
	any calls to realloc kind of unnecessary.  But if 
	MAXPATHLEN is ever made > ~2048 this bug could rear
	its ugly head.
