Subject: Error-checking error in login
Index: 	bin/login/login.c 4.2BSD

Description:

	If ttyn is the null string (i.e. "", not 0), that bug is never
	caught, and login proceeds as if everything is peachy.  Yet
	the eventual "chown" and "chmod" calls on ttyn produce bizarre
	results.  Both system calls blithely and silently decide that the
	null string really means the current working directory, so "." is
	chowned to the current user and chmodded 622 (unusable).
	At this point, /etc/utmp is also FUBAR.

Repeat-By:

	Somehow make a tty entry null.  For instance, a comment (or some extra
	trash) after a tty entry in /etc/ttys will destroy thefollowing entries.

Fix:

	Add a check for the null string when we check for NULL.
