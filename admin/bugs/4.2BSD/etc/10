Subject: a couple of /etc/sa problems
Index: 	etc/sa.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	2 problems,

	1) sa -u produces rubbish output
	2) commands that exit with AFORK set potentially have rubbish
	   added to their names (after the '*' that indicates AFORK)

Repeat-By:
	1) just run sa -u
	2) run any options on sa & look at output for commands with
	   names like 'sh*n'.

Fix:
	1) fix the printf at line 636 of sa.c 4.3 (in procedure doacct,
	   just after 'if (uflg) {'), it's basically rubbish.  Var 'x'
	   is a long, being printed as %6.1f, which is main source of
	   trouble, but also, all the %6d's should be %6ld, and the
	   %.14s should be %.*s, where the arg for the * is NC (which
	   is 10, not 14)

	2) at line 628 of sa.c 4.3, where the '*' is inserted (in doacct()
	   again) the line
			*cp = '*';
	   should really be
			*cp++ = '*';
			if (cp < &fbuf.ac_comm[NC])
				*cp = 0;

ps: sam's comments about times being in minutes instead of seconds
are irrelevant, that's what they are supposed to be (according
to the manual, and all previous versions of sa).  That is one of
the few 60's in all the source code that's not related to HZ.
