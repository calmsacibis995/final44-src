Subject: Apropos doesn't expand nroff strings
Index: etc 4.2BSD

Description:
	The apropos database is generated from the online manuals
	in a way which does not always work.  In particular, if the
	manual's NAME field contains nroff string variable references
	those will remain unexpanded in the apropos database.
Repeat-By:
	Create or edit a manual page.
	Add the following line to the beginning of the nroff file.
	    .ds N will\ not
	Insert a reference to this string variable in the .sh NAME
	Field of the manual like this.
	    .sh NAME
	    program \- This \*N work right as before.
	Notice that the manual page looks like:
	    progam(1) - This will not work right as before
	Rebuild the apropos database.
	Type: 'apropos program'.  Notice that the line looks like:
	    program(1) - This \*N work right as before.
