Subject: Bugs fixes for routing daemon
Index: etc/in.routed 4.2BSD

Description:
	1) Routed would not broadcast information to gateway interfaces
	   that were configured for no trailers (via ifconfig).  New
	   bits that were added to the if_flags for ifconfig conflicted
	   with usage of the bits internal to routed.  Other symptoms
	   may be caused by the same problem.
	2) Routed did not sanity check hop counts or address information.
Repeat-By:
	1) Attempt to use gateway with trailers disabled.
	2) Unknown.
Fix:
For (1) - turn off kernel flags bits not relevant to routed:

------- interface.h -------
42a43
> #define	IFF_FROMKERNEL	0x1F		/* only kernel flags allowed */

------- startup.c -------
105c105
< 		ifp->int_flags = ifs.if_flags | IFF_INTERFACE;
---
> 		ifp->int_flags = (ifs.if_flags&IFF_FROMKERNEL) | IFF_INTERFACE;

For (2) - clear MBZ fields in inet_canon; check for negative metrics
in receive packets.

------- af.c -------
100a101
> 	register int i;
102a104,105
> 	for (i=0; i < sizeof(sin->sin_zero); i++)
> 		sin->sin_zero[i] = 0;

------- input.c -------
107c107,108
< 			if (n->rip_metric >= HOPCNT_INFINITY)
---
> 			if (n->rip_metric < 0 ||
> 			    n->rip_metric >= HOPCNT_INFINITY)
