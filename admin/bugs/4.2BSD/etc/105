Index: etc 4.2BSD

The tab initialization sequence in the termcap for the Ann Arbor
Ambassador which is distributed with 4.2BSD is incorrect.  The problem
is that this sequence does not set a tab at column 0; a tab in column 72
with line wrap set will move the cursor to column 8 of the next line,
while it should move it to column 0.  When the RESET key on the
Ambassador is hit, tabs are set properly.
