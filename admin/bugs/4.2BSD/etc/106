Subject: bug in tset : net.unix-wizards
Index: etc 4.2BSD

[ ]	when using the -m option, tset does not properly handle terminal types
	in /etc/ttytype with '-' in the name.  For example:

	An entry in /etc/ttytype ...

		aaa-48 tty60 

	and the commands in your .profile ...

		TERM=what-ever-terminal-you-use-for-dialup
		tset -Q -s -e^H -k^U -m "dialup:?${TERM-intext}"
		export TERM TERMCAP;

	will yield TERM=dumb and TERMCAP=``dumb settings'' when you
	login.

	PROPOSED FIX:

	The problem lies in stypeof() in tset.c.  stypeof is the routine that
	reads /etc/ttytype.  This fix ONLY works if the field separator in
	/etc/ttytype is white space (the way I feel it should be).
