Subject: ra80 disktab bugs
Index: etc/disktab 4.2BSD

Description:
	Just in case this doesn't make it to you through some other
	channel, I thought I'd pass on Pat Parseghian's comments on the
	ra80 disktab.  Someone on the unix-wizards list had complained
	that it didn't work, and she responded:

		... In the 4.3 disktab (version 4.11, date 5/31/86) the
		entry for the RA80 is incorrect (I just ran into the
		same problem).  The RA80 has 546 cylinders, not 559.

Repeat-By:
	Try to newfs an 'h' partition on an ra80.

Fix:
	[From Pat:]  Make the following changes to /etc/disktab:
		:nc#546:
		:pc#236964:
		:pe#187640:
		:pg#187054:
		:ph#105560:
	I have made the h partition successfully; I haven't tried e or g.
