Subject: tftpd doesn't check file permissions properly
Index: 	etc/tftpd.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The tftp daemon runs as root and is only supposed to let you
	access files with public read.  However, it only checks the
	file itself, not the path to the file.
Repeat-By:
	chmod 700 /sys
	tftp localhost
	get /sys/sys/tty.c
Fix:
	I fixed it by doing a setgid(-2), setuid(-2) before checking access
	permissions.  It's hard to check the entire path by hand because
	of symbolic links; you really have to run as someone who will only
	have public permission to the file.  -2/-2 is not guaranteed to be
	restrictive enough, but it was a quick fix.  Perhaps a uid/gid should
	be reserved for this purpose.

	Sorry, no diff of the fix.  Our tftpd has changed far too much for
	other reasons for it to be useful.
