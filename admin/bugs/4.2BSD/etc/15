Subject: catman refuses to do manl or mann
Index: 	etc/catman 4.2BSD

Description:
	The command "/etc/catman l" silently does nothing.
	This is because catman insists that all names be *.[0-9]
	followed by an optional letter.
Repeat-By:
	rm -f /usr/man/catl/*
	/etc/catman l
	ls /usr/man/catl

	The ls will show that /usr/man/catl is still empty.
Fix:
	Change catman to allow *.x, where x is the name of the
	section being processed.

			/*
			 * Make sure this is a man file, i.e., that it
			 * ends in .[0-9] or .[0-9][a-z]
			 */
			tsp = rindex(dir->d_name, '.');
			if (tsp == NULL)
				continue;
		>>>>	if (!isdigit(*++tsp) && *tsp != *sp)
				continue;
			if (*++tsp && !isalpha(*tsp))
				continue;
