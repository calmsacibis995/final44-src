Subject: Yet another ifconfig bug: can't set address and option at same time

Index:	etc/ifconfig.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Even with Tom Lyons' fixes, it did not work when setting
	the address of an interface the 1st time and also setting
	a flag.  Problem was that the SIFADDR ioctl can change the
	value of the flags, e.g., RUNNING and BROADCAST, but a later
	option setting will use the original value of flags.

Repeat-By:
	E.g., in /etc/rc.local, for an interlan, do:
		/etc/ifconfig il0 `hostname` -arp
	You should get an interface that's UP but not broadcast or running,
	which breaks a number of things (like rwhod).

Fix:
	This is to sid 4.5 on monet.  Add this code to the end of setifaddr().
-------------
	/* 
	 * SIFADDR ioctl above can change the flags value if it is
	 * the first time the address has been set.  Must get the
	 * new flags so that we don't store outdated ones later on.
	 */
	if (ioctl(s, SIOCGIFFLAGS, (caddr_t)&ifr) < 0) {
		Perror("ioctl (SIOCGIFFLAGS) 2");
		exit(1);
	}
	flags = ifr.ifr_flags;
