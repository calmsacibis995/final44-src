Subject: Byte order conversion error in remote login deamon on 4.2bsd
Index: 	etc/rlogind.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	In the routine doit() in rlogind.c at line 141 there is a
		fromp->sin_port = htons((u_short)fromp->sin_port);
	Shouldn't it be ntohs() instead of htons() since fromp was
	received from accept() which means that it is in the the network byte
	order. From what I can tell the reason for this conversion would
	be to be able to do:
		if ( ....... ||
		    fromp->sin_port >= IPPORT_RESERVED ||
		    ..... 
	later on in doit().

Repeat-By:
	NOTE: this "bug" causes no problem since ntohs() and htons() both
	switch two bytes.
Fix:
	Change htons() to ntohs().
