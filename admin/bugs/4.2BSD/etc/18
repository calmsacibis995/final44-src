Subject: Garbled error message in swapon(8)
Index: 	etc/swapon.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When one of the syscalls returns -1, the routine hand-generates
	an error message.  One of the arguments to printf is missing,
	resulting in a garbled message being printed on the console.
Repeat-By:
	Execute "swapon -a" manually.  Since it was presumably run automatically
	already by /etc/rc, the manual execution will fail, since the
	swap devices will be busy.  One good message and one bad one
	will be printed for each swap device in /etc/fstab.
Fix:
	Replace the offending message generation with a call to perror(3).
	"diff old new" yields the following:
	28,31c28
	< 				extern errno;
	< 				extern char *sys_errlist[];
	< 				printf("%s: %s\n",
	< 				    sys_errlist[errno]);
	---
	> 				perror(fsp->fs_spec);
