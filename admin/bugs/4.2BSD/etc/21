Subject: routed sets flag bits incorrectly
Index: etc/routed/startup.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Routed sets its internal flags wrong for interfaces.  The flags 0x1
	to 0x10 are the same as the kernel flags, but the other flag bits are
	never masked out.
Repeat-By:
	Set the 'trailers', and '-arp' configuration flags for a hardware
	interface with /etc/ifconfig, then start routed.  routed will get
	confused and delete the routing entry for that interface. 
Fix:
	Mask out the flag bits which are not the same as the kernel flags
	bits.  (i'm not certain of the line numbers.)
