Subject: sa has truncation errors beyond reason
Index: 	etc/sa.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	sa now stores times as seconds; as many (most) processes use
	up considerably less than a second of user or system time,
	sa's results are meaningless.
Repeat-By:
	run 2 billion cat < /dev/null > /dev/null 's
	and one troff. troff will come up first on the sa sorted list,
	even though the accumulated cat's should have considerably more
	total time -- they don't, as each one's time was truncated to 0.
Fix:
	Store accounting numbers as 60's (the way it used to be) or some
	other fraction of a second. Using 60's is expensive (but would
	fix the problem where sa prints everything out as 1/60'th
	what it should be.) [ed's note: another fix is to store times
	as 60ths in a long again, instead of two longs *burp* ]
