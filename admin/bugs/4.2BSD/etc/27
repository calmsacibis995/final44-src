Subject: getty ignores the 'ck' (crtkill) flag in gettytab
Index: 	etc/getty/subr.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Even if the ck flag was set in gettytab, the CRTKIL flag
	was never being set in the local mode word.
	Looks as though someone forgot to put the code in, since
	it is just like to ce and cb code (crterase and crtbs)
Repeat-By:
	make a gettytab entry with a :ck: entry
	login 
	stty everything
	crtkill won't be set
Fix:

> 	if (CK)
> 		f |= CRTKIL;
