Subject: Group membership lists are not always set right by rshd
Index: 	etc/rshd.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The code to set up the group membership lists is mis-ordered.
	If a user is in the group that rshd runs under (typically 0),
	he will never recieve permissions for that group as they
	are revoked by the setgid() immediately following.
Repeat-By:
	Edit /etc/group to give yourself access to the group that
	rshd runs under (typically group 0).  Then do an rsh
	command "rsh xxx groups" where xxx is the name of the machine
	and surprise! it does not show your membership in the group.
Fix:
	The fix is simply to reverse the order of the calls to
	setgid() and initgroups(), as per the following diff.

  		pwd->pw_shell = "/bin/sh";
  	(void) close(f);
#ifdef	PUCC
  	(void) setgid(pwd->pw_gid);
  	initgroups(pwd->pw_name, pwd->pw_gid);
#else	PUCC
  	initgroups(pwd->pw_name, pwd->pw_gid);
  	(void) setgid(pwd->pw_gid);
#endif	PUCC
  	(void) setuid(pwd->pw_uid);
  	environ = envinit;
  	strncat(homedir, pwd->pw_dir, sizeof(homedir)-6);
