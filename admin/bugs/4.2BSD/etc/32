Subject: telnetd cannot use all of the ptys
Index: 	etc/telnetd.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	/etc/telnetd can only use /dev/ptyp*, 16 devices, even though
	the kernel is configured for 32 and the other 16 have entries
	in /dev as ptyq*.  Several users running script or Emacs with
	subprocesses can prevent other logins over the network.

Repeat-By:
	Make sure that /dev/ptyq[0-9a-f] exist; if not,
		su
		cd /dev; MAKEDEV pty1
	Also, make sure that entries for ttyq* exist in /etc/ttys.
	cd /tmp
	Keep typing "script" until a "ps" shows that you're using
	ptyq0 (you may need to be root to do this if the system is
	unloaded, since it takes a bunch of processes.)  Then, 
	"telnet localhost" and you'll get "telnetd: All network
	ports in use".
Fix:
	telnetd should check all potential ptys before giving up.
	Even though /dev/MAKEDEV can only make 48 ptys, it seems
	reasonable to support up to 64.  For example, /usr/ucb/script
	looks for /dev/pty[pqrs][0-9a-f]
	
	After recompiling and reinstalling telnetd, you'll either
	have to reboot or find some other way of terminating all
	telnet sessions in progress, before you can successfully
	restart telnetd.
