Subject: rwhod rejects messages from hosts with "-" in their names
Index: 	etc/rwhod/rwhod.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Rwhod goes through a number of tests on received messages to
	make sure they are valid.  However, the test on the hostname
	from the message is too strict; it only accepts letters and
	digits.  However, RFC810 specifically allows '.' and '-' in
	host names.  Thus, there are hosts which are not recognized
	by rwhod.
Repeat-By:
	[Must be root to do this test]
	(1) Set your host name so that it contains a "-", e.g., "ucb-arpa".
	(2) restart /etc/rwhod
	(3) Observe that "ucb-arpa" is never listed by ruptime or rwho
Fix:
	This fix brings rwhod closer to conformance with RFC810; it now
	should accept all legal host names, although it still accepts some
	illegal ones ("3PO" is illegal but was accepted before; ".FOO" and
	"FOO-" are illegal and are now accepted -- but who cares?)
	
	Line numbers may vary.  There is only one occurance of "isascii"
	in rwhod.c, though.
