Subject: rexecd closes off stdin before exec'ing command
Index: 	etc/rexecd 4.2BSD (sccsid 4.11, dated 4/11/84)

Description:
	A bug was introduced into rexecd when it was converted to run
	with the inet super-daemon.  Originally, the first argument
	to the routine doit() is a socket and must always be closed
	before execl()ing the specified command.  With the new version,
	the inet daemon dup2()s the socket to standard input (descriptor
	0), but rexecd still does a close() on the first argument of
	doit() and so closes off standard input.  The result is that
	programs run with the new rexecd cannot read from standard input
	(except for /bin/csh which does some really weird things).
Repeat-By:
	Create a new user "news" with password "netnews" and login
	program /tmp/try2.  Use the following program as try2:

		#include <stdio.h>

		main()
		{
			register int	i, fd;
			char		buf[BUFSIZ];

			fd = creat("/tmp/junk", 0644);
			while ((i = read(0, buf, sizeof buf)) > 0)
				(void) write(fd, buf, i);
			(void) close(fd);
			exit(0);
		}

	Then execute the following program:

		#include <sys/types.h>
		#include <netdb.h>

		char	buf[] = "Hello world\n";

		main()
		{
			int		fd;
			char		*host;
			struct servent	*rexecp;

			host = "your host name";
			rexecp = getservbyname("exec", "tcp");
			fd = rexec(&host, (u_short) rexecp->s_port,
				"news", "netnews",
				"command", (int *) 0);
			if (fd < 0) {
				perror("rexec");
				exit(1);
			}
			(void) write(fd, buf, sizeof buf);
			(void) close(fd);
			exit(0);
		}

	The file /tmp/junk should have the words "Hello world" in it.
Fix:
	Replace
		(void) close(f);
	in doit() about line 177 with
		if (f > 2) (void) close(f);
