Subject: pstat -t code is ugly

Index: etc/pstat.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The pstat -t code appears to have a bug in its handling of systems
	without ptys.  The code reads

		pty:
			if (nl[SPTY].n_type == 0)
				goto pty;

	which is obviously wrong.  Soemthing else I just noticed is
	that it assumes 32 ptys, which is wrong on our system.

	Also, the code is ridiculous!  Why duplicate the read-and-print
	loop for every device?  Suggested fix is to have a routine to
	find the ``nXX'' and ``XX'' (XX==device) labels, read them and
	the tty structures,

		printf("%d %s line%s\n", n, devname, n == 1 ? "" : "s"),

	and then print out the interesting info.
