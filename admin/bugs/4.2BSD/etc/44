Subject: XON/XOFF problems with vt125
Index: etc/termcap 4.2BSD

Description:
	The vt125 terminal has a nonstandard feature of sending
	multiple XOFF's as its buffers rapidly fill.  This confuses
	the kernel which only expects one.
Repeat-By:
	cat /etc/termcap on a vt125 terminal at 9600 baud.
	Your terminal should soon freeze up.
Fix:
	Here's our vt125 termcap entry that seems to have eliminated
	the problem.  Chances are it will still occasionally
	bite you in graphics mode unless appropriate delays are
	inserted by your graphics filter.  You can manually send
	a ^Q (XON) character to free things up if this happens.


#
# adjusted vt125 entry featuring visible bell and two plane clear
# also deleted padding delay because xon/xoff already used and
# null characters moved cursor! (at least in visible bell string)
#
# 9/22    cr and nl delay inserted to avoid second and third XOFF
#	  as buffer fills to 116 and 128 characters.  am turned off
#	  as well to force cr/nl after about 80 chars. -- stew
