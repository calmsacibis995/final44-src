Subject: rlogging out blows away all processes attached to your terminal
Index: 	etc/rlogind.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	As its final act before "exit"ing, "rlogind" does a kill(0, SIGKILL).
	This is *extremely* antisocial, especially if you have done a "uucp"
	which starts up a "uucico".
Repeat-By:
	"rlogin" to a machine, start up a background job, and log out.
Fix:
	Get rid of the kill(0, SIGKILL) in "cleanup"; the "vhangup" there
	sends a SIGHUP, which is sufficient.
