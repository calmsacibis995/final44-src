Subject: rlogin breaks shells under new process group scheme
Index:	etc/rlogind.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Rlogind leaves a control process running as root in the process
	group of the login after it forks.  The recent tightening of
	security with regard to process groups will not allow the user
	to set himself into a group that has a root process in it.
	This behavior causes certain invocations of the shells to break.

Repeat-By:
	1.  Rlogin to an account that uses /bin/sh as the login shell.
	2.  Invoke /bin/csh.
	3.  Exit /bin/csh.

	You will now be hung.
Fix:
	In the function doit(), just prior to calling protocol(), insert
		setpgrp(0)
	to get the control process into a relatively save process group.
