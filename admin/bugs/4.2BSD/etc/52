Subject: rwhod doesn't allow dashes in host names
Index: 	etc/rwhod/rwhod.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	rwhod doesn't allow a dash to appear in hostnames.  Dash is
	a legal character in names.
Repeat-By:
	Try running rwhod on a network with hosts with dashes in their names.
Fix:
	At about line 210:

verify(name)
	register char *name;
{
	register int size = 0;

	while (*name) {
+		/* didn't used to allow dashes in names!   -gildea 7 aug 85 */
|		if (!isascii(*name) || !(isalnum(*name) || *name == '-'))
			return (0);
		name++, size++;
	}
	return (size > 0);
}
