Subject: gettytab should have a %H specifier
Index: 	etc/getty/main.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Some sites like to have the host name printed in uppercase in
	getty's initial message.  It would therefore be nice if the
	im string in gettytab supported a %H spec which was like %h
	but converted the hostname to uppercase.
