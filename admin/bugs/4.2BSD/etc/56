Subject: telnetd 4.2 Fix

Index:	etc/telnetd.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Fix various telnet daemon bugs:
	(1) was dropping bytes when input buffers couldnt
	be emptied before next select.
	(2) binary option shouldn't put the controlling pty
	into RAW mode, this is a function of the slave tty.
	This was breaking TN from some TOPS-20 sites that
	default to binary mode for emacs meta key users.
	(3) some "fatalperror" messages were written to closed
	file descriptors.

Repeat-By:
	Byte drop problem could be seen by, for example, "od /vmunix",
	or any program producing continuous sustained output.
	
Fix:
	Apply the "diff -e" below.
