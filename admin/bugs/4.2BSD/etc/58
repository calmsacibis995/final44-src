Description:
	It is possible under ftp to defeat the checking for null
	passwords in /etc/passwd.  This allows users to login
	without a password to access the system.

Repeat-By:
	ftp to a machine with a null passwd for some user (cory won't
	work).  Give the user name.  When asked for a passwd, respond
	with "@".  It will log one onto the machine as that user.

Fix:

diff ftpd.c ftpd.old.c
224c224
< 		if (! *(pw->pw_passwd) || (strcmp(xpasswd, pw->pw_passwd) != 0)) {
---
> 		if (strcmp(xpasswd, pw->pw_passwd) != 0) {
