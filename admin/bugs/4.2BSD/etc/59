Subject: inconsistent return codes in /etc/rdump

Index: etc/dump/dump.h  4.2BSD

Description:
	Return codes from dump and rdump are defined
		X_FINOK   1
		X_REWRITE 2
		X_ABORT   3
	It is obvious that X_FINOK means success and the
	others indicate different degrees of failure.
	However, the functions dealing with remote tapes,
	(in dumprmt.c) return 0 for success and 1 for failure.
	This inconsistency is not simply resolved by
	merely changing dumprmt.c function returns, since those
	functions are also used by /etc/rrestore command.
	I suggest you redefine dump return codes like this
		X_FINOK   0
		X_ABORT   1
		X_REWRITE 2
	Then no change will be needed in dumprmt.c or rrestore.
	Also, you should mention the return code values in
	dump manual page.		--Genji
