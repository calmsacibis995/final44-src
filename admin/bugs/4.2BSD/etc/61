Subject:  dump at 6250 bpi miscounts amount of tape used

Index:	etc/dump/dumptape.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	dump stops writing on a tape volume long before the real end
	of tape, and uses more volumes than it estimated.  The estimated
	amount is fairly accurate, but the tape length used is not accounted
	for the same way.  In particular, the inter-record gap is estimated
	at 0.3" for 6250, but the value used is hardwired at 0.7" in dumptape.c
	and dumprtape.c (which is the 800 and 1600 bpi value).

Repeat-By:
	Dump a filesystem of larger than 145 megabytes, using the non-rewind
	tape drive at 6250 bpi.  When it asks to change tapes, look how close
	it got to the end of the tape (almost 500 feet left when I tried it).

Fix:
	in routine flusht(), files dumptape.c and dumprtape.c, increment asize
	by the proper amount.  It would be best to compute this once and use
	a global variable, but for now, this works:
