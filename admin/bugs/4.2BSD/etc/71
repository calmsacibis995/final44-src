Subject: small bug in init
Index: etc/init.c 4.2BSD
From: Richard Johnson <raj@uci-750a>

Description:
	The init program uses the assumption that if after running getty
	that fork returns in less than 1 minute, then getty failed.  This
	is not always true.
Repeat-By:
	Pick a terminal and keep logging in and back out again making sure
	you never stay logged in for more than 1 minute.  After about 5 times
	of logging in and out again, the console will produce the bogus
	message "init: getty failing; sleeping...".
Fix:
	Reset the time of the last try at running getty on a line to zero
	when you know for sure a person has logged out on that line.
	The only fix needed is at the end of the routine "rmut".  After this
	fix has been installed, the only way to produce the message is by
	Control-C'ing getty over and over.  This is not worth worrying about.

	The line numbers for "bk_init.c" are correct for the original berkeley
	source but the ones for "init.c" can't be trusted.
