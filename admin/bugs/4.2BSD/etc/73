Subject: Bad choice of service port

Index:	etc/rexec 4.2BSD

Description:
	The "rexec" service uses TCP service port 514.  Service ports
	are restricted to the range 0..255; see RFC790, p. 7, and
	many non-UCB systems cannot communicate with this illegal
	service port.  This prevents us from doing file backups with
	"rdump" from a 4.2 based system (a Sun) to a system with better 
	tape drives that doesn't happen to run 4.2BSD.
Repeat-By:
	Examine the table used by "getservbyname".
Fix:
	Pick a new number.  Values from 64-131 are intended for
	"host specific functions".   77, assigned to "any private RJE
	server" is probably a good choice.
