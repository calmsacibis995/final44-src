Subject: Process group not reset in daemons
Index: etc/*d 4.2BSD

Description:
	All daemons go to the trouble of reseting the controlling tty,
	but never bother to reset the pgrp with a "setpgrp(0);"
	The process groups are reused later by csh, and a user could
	accidentally send a signal to the daemon.
	This doesn't happen when it is started from rc, but if it
	is started by hand (from the shell), it will eventually happen.
Repeat-By:
	Start /usr/lib/lpd up on 16 heavily loaded machines by hand, and wait
	several days.  At least one will die within the first week.
Fix:
	After the controlling tty is cleared, do a
		setpgrp(0);
