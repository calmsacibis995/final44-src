Subject: cd /usr/adm; if [ ! -r msgbuf ] ; then echo "messages cancerous"; fi

Index:		etc/dmesg.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	If "/etc/dmesg" is run by "cron" and the file "/usr/adm/msgbuf"
	is missing, the file "/usr/adm/messages" grows rapidly (and
	erroneously).

Repeat-By:
	Removing "/usr/adm/msgbuf" and waiting a day.  (Note well: I
	advise taking my word for it rather than doing this.)

	The problem comes about because "/etc/dmesg" fails to check to see
	if "/usr/adm/msgbuf" exists.

Fix:
	The real fix is to correct "/etc/dmesg".  Here's the universal
	fix, though--one that can be applied even if you have a binary-
	only license.

	If your "/usr/lib/crontab" file has a line like

		0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /etc/dmesg - >>/usr/adm/messages

	then add a line like

		8,18,28,38,48,58 * * * * touch /usr/adm/msgbuf

	You can schedule the "touch" command less frequently if you
	like, at the cost of some spurious output in "/usr/adm/messages"
	if "msgbuf" ever disappears.
