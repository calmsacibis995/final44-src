Subject: 'dmesg -' acts like 'dmesg' if '/usr/adm/msgbuf' does not exist

Subject: 'dmesg -' acts like 'dmesg' if '/usr/adm/msgbuf' does not exist
Index:	etc/dmesg.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	'dmesg -' is supposed to summarize the kernel messages that
	have accumulated since the last time 'dmesg -' was run.  If the
	file '/usr/adm/msgbuf' does not exist then 'dmesg -' acts just
	like 'dmesg', putting a copy of the entire message buffer on
	the standard output every time it is run.  No indication of
	failure is returned or printed by 'dmesg -' when it fails to
	find '/usr/adm/msgbuf'.

Repeat-By:
	Remove '/usr/adm/msgbuf' on an active system where 'dmesg - >>
	/usr/adm/messages' is run every ten minutes by 'cron'.
	'/usr/adm/messages' will grow by several megabytes a week.

Fix:
	I changed 'dmesg' so that it tries to create '/usr/adm/msgbuf'
	if that file does not exist, and to complain to the standard
	output if the file cannot be opened.  I also changed the places
	where a 'clever' coder had relied on the fact that a read or a
	write on a file descriptor of '-1' has no effect.  Here are the
	differences:

	--------------------------------------------------------------

	This modified version of 'dmesg' at least creates the summary
	file -- I haven't tried forcing the error report yet.

	A small point:  someone should also change the code and
	documentation to force the summarization flag on 'dmesg' to be
	'-s' instead of just '-'.  This would bring it in line with the
	other system programs which create summary files (e.g. 'pac',
	'sa').
