Subject: Spurious termcap entries slow things down
Index: 	etc/termcap 4.2BSD

Description:
	Many termcap entries spuriously include nl and cr entries.  They
	are only supposed to exist for terminals for which nl != ^J or
	cr != ^M respectively.  This slows up vi and curses-based programs
	(and any other program which does addressing right) since they
	use tputs() to print out the nl and cr strings if they exist, but
	use putchar if they don't.  This is quite a bit of exra overhead,
	especially considering it is completely unecessary and is, actually,
	wrong (see termcap(5)).

	If you don't believe me (and you should, after all), ask Mark
	Horton.

Repeat-By:
	Examine the h19 entry.  Note that it has nl=^J.

Fix:
	vi /etc/termcap
	:g/nl=^J:/s///
	:g/cr=^M:/s///
	:wq
