Subject: fsck misfeature

Index:	etc/fsck 4.2BSD

Description:
	fsck creates files whose names begin with #.
	# is the shell's comment character.
	As a result, any attempts to manipulate the contents
	of the lost+found directory after a serious crash
	results in problems.

	Note, the usual trick to subvert this is to use names
	like *6154 to match #6154.  However, ksh expands the
	globbed string when you refer to it in the history.
Repeat-By:
	Have a horrible crash of your system, where lots of things
	get put in lost+found.  (If this is inconvenient, just hunt
	through the various lost+found directories and look for one
	with something in it.) These files have names like #6154.

	cd to the lost+found directory.

	Type
		ls
	and watch what is printed.  Now suppose #6154 is a directory.
	Type
		ls #6154
	and notice that what is listed is ., not #6154.
	Type
		ls *6154
	to get around this.  Now, if you're in the Korn shell, type
		ls -ld ESC_	(pre the ESC key at the appropriate time)
	It expands to
		ls #6154
	and it lists . as before.
Fix:
	Change fsck to use some other character instead of # for the
	files it creates, e.g. % or i would be good, or just don't create
	any character there.

	Alternatively, allow # comments embedded in shell scripts
	only if the # is preceded by a tab or newline.

	The Korn shell might consider not globbing history substitutions.
