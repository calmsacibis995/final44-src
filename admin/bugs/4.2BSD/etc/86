Subject: Stderr from rc scripts is lost
Index: 	etc/rc* 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	In the startup scripts, /etc/rc and /etc/rc.local, most stdout
	is redirected to /dev/console, but stderr is not.  If any of the
	programs invoked by the scripts produce messages on stderr -
	savecore(8) does for one - these messages are lost.
Repeat-By:
	Write a "hello, world" program that uses stderr and run it from
	/etc/rc.local.  No message appears.
Fix:
	In /etc/rc and /etc/rc.local, for each program that can generate
	messages on stderr (ie not all the echo(1)s), change
		>/dev/console
	to
		>/dev/console 2>&1
