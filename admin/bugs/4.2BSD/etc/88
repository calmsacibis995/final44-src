Subject: bug in /etc/dmesg (4.2 BSD, VAX 11/750)
Index: etc/dmesg.c   4.2BSD

Description:
  If the kernal msgbuf area gets to be exactly 4088 bytes long
(i.e. the declared length of the buffer), dmesg marches off into
oblivion, eventually core dumping.  In the process, /usr/adm/messages
grew about 500 Kb in 8 hours.

Repeat-By:
  Hah!  This is the first time I've seen this happen in 1 year
of running 4.2 BSD, with plenty of kernal errors being reported.
You might be able to repeat the problem by judicious banging on
tape drives.  That's how I got it to stop, before installing fix.

Fix:
  This fix is untested.  Looks like same problem could happen if
/usr/adm/msgbuf gets to be exactly 4088 bytes, so that fix is thrown in
too.  There's got to be a better fix.
