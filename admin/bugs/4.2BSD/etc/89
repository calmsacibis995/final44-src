Subject: DUMP/RESTORE Peckage.
Index: 	etc/dump 4.2BSD

Description:
  The DUMP/RESTORE programs got the following serious bugs:
1. The DUMP can't handle End-of-Tape in an normal way.  The DUMP program
   should run untill encountering EOT, and then change to a new real,
   like any normal OS.
2. The RESTORE bugs section says that the RESTORE might get confused when
   restoring file's systems that were dump when they were active.  This should
   be corrected, since it is impossible to shut-down the system every 2 days
   for backups.
3. The DUMP rewinds the tape after it finishes.  This should be removed, so
   more than 1 file system would be dumped on one tape (the tapes are very
   expensive).
Fix:
  Thanks in advance, and I hope that I'll get the patches before the end of
the week.
