Subject: quotacheck dies with 'Too Many Files Open'
Index: etc 4.2BSD

Description:
	/etc/quotacheck -a
	on a file system with two disks (ra81s,VAX750) and
	all the logical disks configured, simply runs out of
	file descriptors. This is particularly annoying in
	the rc.local file.
Repeat-By:

	/etc/quotacheck -a
	on a disk with sufficient logical volumes
	(it fails for us on /dev/rra1g)
Fix:
	in the routine chkquota() simply close file descriptors
	before returning. I did this by changing all occurances
	of return(x) to RETURN(x) added the local 'int retval'
	and created '#define RETURN(x) retval = x ; goto done ;'
	and then added a postscript which closed the file descriptor
	in any case and return(retval). It's not ideal but required
	minimal code reading and it does work as the file descriptor
	is local to the routine.
