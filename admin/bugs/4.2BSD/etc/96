Subject: New quotas sometimes don't 'take'
Index: etc 4.2BSD

Description:
	Have not had a chance to full investigate but was
	hoping someone else fixed this one. After using
		edquota -p proto user
	either no quota is set (as reported by 'quota -v')
	or some quotas are set (or sometimes all quotas are
	set.) Seems to be much more reliable if more than one
	user on the line but not completely so. Repeating the
	edquota command sometimes fixes it sometimes annoyingly
	adds just one more logical disk quota so has to be run
	repeatedly. Eventually it ALWAYS works.

	I have tried doing sync's before and after and ran
	quotacheck to try to straighten things out to no real
	avail.

Repeat-By:
	A little random in behavior but 'edquota -p user'
	where there are several disks for which quotas are
	defined seems to have the highest hit rate.
Fix:
	This is the hard part, could be anywhere: Utilities to
	set quotas, to read back quotas, concurrency problems
	(eg. disk not properly synchronized) or kernel error.
	I don't know [yet.] As I said above, only nuisance in
	nature unless your administrative policies state disaster
	if a user gets improper disk quotas.
