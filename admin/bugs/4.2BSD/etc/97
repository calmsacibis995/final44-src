Savecore gets the size of the dump (dumpsize) from the wrong version of
the kernel.  The running kernel at the time savecore is run is a fresh
one.  Since dumpsize is set during the dump, the value savecore gets
(from the running kernel) is always zero.

Just move the fetch for dumpsize so that it gets it from the dumped
system (on the swap space).
