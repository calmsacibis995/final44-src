Subject: 4.2BSD catman(8) fails on large manual +FIX
Index: etc 4.2BSD

PROBLEM:
    /etc/catman -w gives message "?TMP" and creates an empty
    /usr/lib/whatis.

REPEAT-BY:
    /etc/catman -w did it for us.  It is dependent on the number of
    manual entries, and the size of their NAME sections.

DIAGNOSIS:
    Catman runs /usr/lib/makewhatis, which uses ed(1) to massage a
    bunch of header lines from the manuals.  Ed is running out of buffer
    space somewhere.  "?TMP" is one of those `self-explanatory message's
    from ed.

FIX:
    The same function can be performed with sed(1), and doesn't need to
    use a buffer.  I have also made it include the "local" and "new"
    manual sections in the whatis database, though I'm not sure I
    should.  In the diff listing below, replace "<TAB>" with a tab
    character.
