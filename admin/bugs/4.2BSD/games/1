Subject: Segmentation violation in trek.
Index: 	games/trek/events.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	trek faults and dumps core from the 3rd call to bmove
	in file events.c (at about line 355).
Repeat-By:
	Good question.  I can't make it happen (and I don't really
	want to plow through all the code to figure it out) with
	regularity.  It seems to occur after I've been playing for 
	a while and have captured some klingons and then try the
	impulse engines.  This usage of the impulse engines sometimes
	selects the particular case that the call to bmove is in, which
	causes the seqmentation fault.
Fix:
	The particular call to bmove that is at fault is:

	    bmove( Now, i, sizeof( Now ) );

	The problem with it is that bmove expects its first arg to 
	be an integer and Now is a struct.  The intention was prob-
	ably to have the address of Now be passed instead of Now 
	itself, so this call should read:

	    bmove ( &Now, i, sizeof( Now ) );

	This fix seems to work (and also makes more sense).
