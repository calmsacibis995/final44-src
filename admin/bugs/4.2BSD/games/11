Subject: Rogue bug 
Index: 	games/rogue 4.2BSD

Description:
	I was on experience level 8, dungeon level 11.  Game was well
	balanced, except for a gross lack of scrolls.  Had accumulated
	lots of potions, staffs, wands, and rings.  Lots of food. Then
	I ran into a nymph who "stole 3 darts."  Immediately thereafter
	I noticed my inventory list had been screwed up...arggg!  All
	potions, staffs, wands, and rings were gone.  NOT ONLY THIS, but
	the inventory list ended with:

			w) 7 darts
			w) A dart

	Surely, two "w" entries is a bug.  Also, before I noticed the
	inventory screw up (and immediately after the nymph encounter) I
	had thrown one of the darts.
