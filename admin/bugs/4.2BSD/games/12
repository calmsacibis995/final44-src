Subject: rogue verses sysline
Index: 	games/rogue 4.2BSD

Description:
	The game of rogue requires that the screen be at least 24 lines long.
	This limit should be decreased to 23 so that people running
	sysline on the 24th line can still play rogue.
Repeat-By:
	Try to run rogue using a termcap entry that reserves the 24th
	line of the screen for sysline.

Subject: rogue screen size limitations too stringent
Index: 	games/rogue 4.2BSD

Description:
	Rogue requires that the screen be at least 24x80.  This should
	be decreased to 23x78.  Descrease the lines to 23 because some
	people run sysline on the 24th line.  Descrease the columns to
	78 because a supdup network connection eats the last two columns.
	Neither of these situations can be considered cheating.
Repeat-By:
	Try to run rogue over a supdup connection or with a sysline on
	the 24th line.
