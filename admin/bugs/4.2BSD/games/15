Subject: bug in rogue
Index: 	games/rogue/?? 4.2BSD

Description:
	Rogue seems to arbitrarily save games and mess up inventories.
	It is not a common occurrence (it happens maybe 1 out of 20 games,
    and then only after several levels).  
    The most common problem is that rogue just decides to save itself 
    in the default save file with no message to the user.  The game 
    is then restorable, but the same thing continues to happen.  
    This is not a problem with the load average stuff because we don't 
    have it installed here at Wisconsin.
	The other problem is that inventories periodically mess up.  This
    seems to happen right along with the save problem.  Large holes
    of blank lines suddenly appear in the inventory, or else about 1/2
    of the pack just disappears.

Repeat-By:
	Hmmm.  This seems to happen at random.  If you want a save file that
	exhibits the bug, I'd be glad to send it to you.
    Or, if you send us the source code, we'd be more than glad to find the
    problem and fix it.


thanks, brian@wisconsin.
