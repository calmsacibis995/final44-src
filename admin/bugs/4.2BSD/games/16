Subject: snake should not avoid score

Index: games 4.2BSD

This bug report for /usr/games/snake includes three fixes.

[1]	An addressing problem with a string, causing the screen to freeze
	on some terminals.

[2]	Random number generation assumes a 16-bit integer;
	it should use the local machine's word size.

[3]	The snake should not avoid the score in the upper left hand corner;
	people can win by specifying a terribly small screen and hiding
	in the upper left hand corner, jumping out when the snake makes a
	mistake.

Fixes in the following diff listing are labeled by the three above bugs.
