Subject: compat
Index: games/compat 4.2BSD

Description:
	Many many problems with compat:
		(1) floating point doesn't work
		(2) environment not passed correctly
		(3) old style directories not supported
Repeat-By:
	Try running the following in compatability mode
		(1) cc (with a file which has floating point code)
		(2) printenv
		(3) ls
Fix:
	If you want a much better compat, contact me.  I use it alot
	for one application around here.
