Subject: In cribbage, flushes are not counted.
Index: 	games/cribbage 4.2BSD

Description:
When counting hands, flushes are not counted (neither 4 or 5 flushes).
This results in not only losing the points for the flush but in
a penalty of two additional points which is particularly vexing.
Repeat-By:
Playing cribbage, throwing cards into the crib at the first opportunity
to form a flush.
