Subject: Rogue gets confused
Index: games/rogue 4.2BSD

Description:
	Rogue gets very confused if you empty out your pack and then try
	picking items up again.  Items get duplicated, others disappear,
	movement leaves little turds on the screen and sooner or later
	the game hangs and/or drops you out into the shell.
	Much more annoying, it gave the same behavior, or a close facsimile,
	with no apparent provocation in the middle of a rather successful
	game.  I stepped into a room on level 9 and the game died.
	When restarted from the saved file, a scroll ? had appeared
	in the doorway and any movement or even inventorying dropped
	me out into the shell; dropping an object gave a scrambled inventory
	list and dropped me into the shell again.  This behavior is
	similar to that induced by emptying one's pack, but rather more annoying
	since it was not deliberately induced.
Repeat-By:
	Empty your pack.
