Subject: backgammon has RUBOUT==SIGINTR hardwired
Index: 	games/backgammon 4.2BSD

Description:
	Recognizes DEL/RUBOUT directly, instead of checking which
	character is USED for interrupt.  VERY annoying -- I've
	never worked on a UNIX system where DELETE is really the
	standard interrupt character, and as it stands I get knocked
	out of backgammon whenever I make a typo and try to correct it.
Repeat-By:
	% stty intr ^c quit ^b erase '^?'
	% backgammon
	    (hit DELETE)
Fix:
	ioctl() call to get local editing characters, and then compare
	against the INTR character rather than DEL.
