Subject: CANFIELD cheats
Index: games/canfield 4.2BSD

Description: 
	Canfield does not correctly run through the hand.  After one
	pass through the hand, I am supposed to have seen every card
	in it.  On the contrary, I have frequently gotten new base
	cards on the foundation on the third or fourth pass through
	the hand.
	
	Also, the tableau is supposed to be shown THREE cards at a
	time.  No fair saying I owe $3 each time ... the last time
	I read Hoyle, it gave MARKEDLY different rules for the game
	than this program enforces.
Repeat-By: 
	Try playing it!!!!
