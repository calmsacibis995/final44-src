Subject: Rogue occasionally dies.
Index: 	 games/rogue 4.2BSD

Description:
	Occasionally rogue gets into a state where motion in a certain
        direction causes it to stop and leave a savefile. It is possible
        to restart from these files but trying to move in that direction
        causes it to stop again; it IS possible to move somewhere else,
        quaff potions, etc.
Repeat-By:
	Unknown but if anyone is interested I have 2 savefiles with this
        problem.
