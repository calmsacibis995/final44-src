Subject: Suggestion for crash recovery
Index: 	ideas 4.2BSD

Description:
	When Unix crashes, it may be a while since the last sync.  File that have
	recently been written to may not have information out yet.  The superblock
	may be wrong.  However, when Unix starts up again, it can determine the
	contents of core at the time of crash and save those contents in a file.
	I recommend that the equivalent of a sync be done (maybe optionally) during
	this time to try to bring the disk to a consistent state without losing
	information.
Repeat-By:
	The situation that is most irksome is leaving the editor a few seconds
	before the crash; the file often ends up empty after the crash.
