Subject: Type-ahead problem in "vi" on heavily loaded system.
Index: ideas 4.2BSD

Description:
	On a heavily loaded system, users have tendency to over-type
	commands because say, after typing ^F the screen doesn't
	move within 15 seconds, the user type
	^F again, thinking that vi has not received the previous one.
	Eventually vi move the screen past the desired place and the
	user has to type ^B which he might over-type again.
Repeat-By:
	Try to use vi when the system is heavily loaded.
Fix:
	It would be nice to have an option to display the unprocessed
	commands (the buffered character vi has received but
	not processed) on the right lower corner of the screen so
	the user knows exactly what vi is going to do. If this
	cannot be done fast enough, just showing the number of 
	pending characters would also help. Or just make a sign
	or something to indicate that there are unprocessed
	commands pending.
