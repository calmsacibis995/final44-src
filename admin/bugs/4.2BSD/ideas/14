Subject:  4.2 BSD Signals:  A Proposal
Index: ideas 4.2BSD

REFRESHER.

On 4.1 and earlier UNIX systems, signal handlers had several attributes:

*)  After a signal was caught, the handler was reset to SIG_DFL.

*)  If the process was executing a (kernel) sleep() at "low" priority,
    and a signal was processed, the system call would abort, returning
    an error code (-1), with errno = u.u_error = EINTR (interupted
    system call).

On 4.2 BSD UNIX, these two aspects of signal handling were altered
(along with some other, nice improvements, which are not germane).

1)  The signal handler remains "installed" until explicitly changed.

2)  System calls which may (kernel) sleep() at "low" priority will
    be silently restarted after processing an incomming signal.
    The signal handler will have no idea if this is happening or not.

PROBLEM.

Clearly, programs written for the old style signal interface will have
a fair amount of difficulty coping with difference #2 above, if they
depend on signals (especially timer signals) interrupting a system
call.  Network software which wishes to run timouts around network
reads will have to longjmp() in the signal handler, rather than
being able to depend on just returning, with an EINTR to be returned
from the read/write sys-call that timed out.  Editors and shells
will have to expect their I/O to be restarted after SIGINT, etc.
(You would not believe the crud that Berkeley had to do to /bin/sh
to make it still capable of re-printing $PS1 after a SIGINT (^C, etc).).

Certainly, change #1 is "mostly harmless";  the number of programs
which will break is minimal -- the timing windows which this change
fixes were something that no mortal programmer would dare depend on.

However, change #2 is truely problematic:  Certainly, there are advantages
to the new style signal interface, and programs which are written with
this style of operation in mind should work out well.  However, no matter
how hard we try, few of us will be able to afford the luxury of running
4.2 BSD on *all* our machines.  Those of you planning on purchasing
a Cray-2 (as we are), will have to contend with System-V UNIX (at least
to start with).  Many other vendors will be non-4.2 BSD, and it is too
late to stomp them all out (pitty, no?).  And somehow, those venerable
old PDP-11s just keep on refusing to quit!

THEREFORE, the problem of program portability rears it's ugly head.
4.2 people (true believers) will, of course, deisre to import quality
software from elsewhere ("expensive, yes, extravagant, no"), without
having to re-write all the signal code.  Others may wish to be able
to use 4.2 code on their own system ("rotsa-ruck").  Being in the
former camp, I would like to offer the following solution:

PROPOSED SOLUTION.

In proc.h, SOUSIG (1 bit in p_flag) is defined to mean "this process is using
the old signal mechanism".  This piece of information is used in two ways:

1)  To determine resetting of default signal handling after traps
	(in sys/kern_sig.c and sys/kern_xxx.c).

2)  To determine restartability of interrupted ("slow") system calls
	(in kern_exit.c, sys_generic.c, sys_inode.c).

By adding another bit to the p_flag word called SDFLSIG and assigning
it function #1 (above) to this new bit, and then redefining the meaning
of SOUSIG to JUST function #2 (above), +and+ by adding a new sys-call
(#151, sigrestartable()) which permits the user to manipulate the
state of the SOUSIG bit, then a solution can be achieved.

For programs which do not use the new sys-call, standard 4.2 functionality
occurs.

Programs which wish to avoid having their sys-calls restarted may say:

	sigrestartable( 0 );

and get the 4.2 interface, with continuously installed signal handlers,
but with sys-calls returning the old familiar EINTR.

Calling sigrestartable() with a non-zero argument restores the 4.2 BSD
style restartable sys-calls, so that one can "live in both worlds"
by switching back and forth.  The sys-call is as fast as getpid(),
so pairs could reasonably be used around old-fashioned code if one
desires to "blend" signaling style within a single program.

STATUS.

This evening, I installed the change I proposed above, into 2 of our 780s.
Effort to change:
	h/proc.h		2 lines
	sys/init_sysent.c:	1 line
	sys/syscalls.c:		1 line
	sys/kern_sig.c		14 lines
	sys/kern_exec.c		1 line
	sys/kern_fork.c		1 line
	sys/kern_xxx.c		1 line

To the best of my ability to test it, this new system call operates
exactly as I have described above.

QUESTION.

What does the UNIX-community-at-large think of this strategy?
If people feel that this is a reasonable solution to the 4.2 signal
"problem", DPK and I will arrange to reproduce many copies of a
1-page document describing how to install this code into your 4.2
kernel, and distribute them at UNIFORvM in Washington DC next week.

On the other hand, if a better proposal can be brought forth,
I am willing to withdraw this proposal and implement something
else, assuming that it offers a solution of similar generality,
elegance, and simplicity (pardon the self-admiration).

CREDIT.

The motivation for addressing this problem at this time came from
a program which Doug Kingston has been working on.  His struggles,
his requests, and his constructive feedback were instrumental in
shaping the form of this solution.  Together we evaluated 7 or 8
different solutions to this problem, before the present solution
was arrived at.

SOURCE CODE.

Just in case you desire to try this change yourself, here is the code:

h/proc.h (2 changes):

change comment to:
#define	SOUSIG	0x0100000	/* old signal semantics: no restart (BRL) */

add at the bottom:
#define SDFLSIG	0x2000000	/* reset signals to default handling (BRL) */


sys/init_sysent.c (2 lines from the bottom):

	1, sigrestartable,		/* 151 = sigrestartable (BRL) */

sys/syscalls.c (1 line from the bottom):

	"sigrestartable",	/* 151 = sigrestartable */

sys/kern_xxx.c (3 lines from the bottom):

from:
	p->p_flag |= SOUSIG;
to:
	p->p_flag |= SOUSIG|SDFLSIG;

sys/kern_exec.c (80% into the file):

from:
	u.u_procp->p_flag &= ~(SPAGI|SSEQL|SUANOM|SOUSIG);
to:
	u.u_procp->p_flag &= ~(SPAGI|SSEQL|SUANOM|SOUSIG|SDFLSIG);

sys/kern_fork.c (50% into the file):

from:
	rpp->p_flag = SLOAD | (rip->p_flag & (SPAGI|SOUSIG));
to:
	rpp->p_flag = SLOAD | (rip->p_flag & (SPAGI|SOUSIG|SDFLSIG));

sys/kern_sig.c (in psig(), 85% into the file):

from:
		if (p->p_flag & SOUSIG) {
to:
		if (p->p_flag & SDFLSIG) {

and, after
#define	cantmask	(mask(SIGKILL)|mask(SIGCONT)|mask(SIGSTOP))
near the front of the file, add this routine:

sigrestartable()				/* BRL-specific */
{
	register struct a {
		int	restartable;
	} *uap = (struct a *)u.u_ap;

	/* BRL syscall to permit non-restartable signal behavior */
	if( uap->restartable )
		u.u_procp->p_flag &= ~SOUSIG;	/* Restartable */
	else
		u.u_procp->p_flag |= SOUSIG;	/* Non-restartable */
}

HAPPY HACKING!
