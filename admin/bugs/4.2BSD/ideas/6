   Since the full names of files to be individually restored must frequently
be found by running dumpdir and digging through the result (thus giving the
inode #'s of the desired files) it would be very useful if there were a
variant of restor that would take inode #'s directly rather than having to
look them up in the dump tape's directory.

Funny, that's what restor USED to do, in version 6 UNIX (RE accepting inode
numbers of files to be restored)!  Thus we see the evils of changing software
without maintaining backward compatability (or without considering the wisdom
of the original designers)...
