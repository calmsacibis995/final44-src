Subject: Nroff underlining
Index: ideas 4.2BSD

A user here has a terminal that does not have a "backspace" capability
(EPSON MX-80).  He wants to use nroff underlining and is wondering
if this is possible.  What is needed is for nroff to output a
line with the underlines followed by carriage return only and
the line of text instead of the underscore/backspace/character
that is sent now for each character.

He has tried telling nroff that he is using tn300, 300s and 450
terminal types, none of these terminals are supposed to be
able to backspace.  Nroff still outputs backspaces with these
terminal types specified.

Any suggestions?
