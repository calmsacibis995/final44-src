Subject: Declaration of inet_addr in <arpa/inet.h> is wrong.
Index: 	include/arpa/inet.h 4.2BSD

Description:
	The declaration of inet_addr in <arpa/inet.h>,
struct	in_addr inet_addr();
	does not match the actual declaration of the routine,
u_long
inet_addr(cp)
	register char *cp;
Repeat-By:
	Examination.  A program that includes <arpa/inet.h>
	and then uses inet_addr will usually core dump.
Fix:
	Make the declaration in <arpa/inet.h> match the real one.
