Jeff -

	In the file /4.2/usr/sys/netinet/ip.h, the macro definitions of
IPOPT_CLASS and IPOPT_NUMBER do not match the Internet Protocol specifications
in RFC 791.  In particular, the class field should be 2 bits long and the
number field should be 5 bits long.  These are the current macro definitions:

#define	IPOPT_CLASS(o)		((o)&0x40)
#define	IPOPT_NUMBER(o)		((o)&0x3f)

	I would expect them to be defined as:

#define	IPOPT_CLASS(o)		((o)&0x60)
#define	IPOPT_NUMBER(o)		((o)&0x1f)

	Also, the bit definitions for the possible classes (IPOPT_CONTROL,
IPOPT_RESERVED1, IPOPT_DEBMEAS, and IPOPT_RESERVED2) appear to be positionally
1 bit off.  They are defined as follows:

#define	IPOPT_CONTROL		0x00
#define	IPOPT_RESERVED1		0x10
#define	IPOPT_DEBMEAS		0x20
#define	IPOPT_RESERVED2		0x30

	I would expect them to be as follows:

#define	IPOPT_CONTROL		0x00
#define	IPOPT_RESERVED1		0x20
#define	IPOPT_DEBMEAS		0x40
#define	IPOPT_RESERVED2		0x60

	Is this worth investigating?  (These are the same definitions used in
4.1c ).

Since none of these masks is used anywhere within 4.2 it hardly matters.
But then again, someday somebody might use them.
