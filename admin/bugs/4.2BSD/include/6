Subject: macros in param.h
Index: 	include/sys/param.h 4.2BSD

Description:
	#define	btodb(bytes)	/* calculates (bytes / DEV_BSIZE) */ \
		((unsigned)(bytes) >> DEV_BSHIFT)
	#define	dbtob(db)	/* calculates (db * DEV_BSIZE) */ \
		((unsigned)(db) << DEV_BSHIFT)

	The above macros explicitly cast the argument to integer.
	I don't know enough about the VAX kernel to know if this is
	necessary, but I think these macros normally take longs as 
	arguments.

Repeat-By:
	Port to a 16 bit machine.
Fix:
	I don't really know, I suspect that it should be changed to 
	"unsigned long" since the VAX supports that type.
