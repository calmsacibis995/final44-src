Subject: <fcntl.h> is incomplete

Index:	include/fcntl.h 4.2BSD

Description:
	I presume "fcntl.h" was stuck in for System(III|V) compatibility,
	since 4.2BSD has compatible "open" and "fcntl" calls; however,
	some definitions are missing from "fcntl.h", namely O_CREAT,
	O_TRUNC, and O_EXCL.

Repeat-By:
	Try compiling some System V program which uses those modes in
	an "open" (but doesn't use the S5 tty driver or any S5-specific
	functions).

Fix:
	Either make "fcntl.h" a symlink to "sys/file.h", or copy the
	missing definitions from "sys/file.h".
