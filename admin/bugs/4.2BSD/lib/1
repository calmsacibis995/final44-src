Subject: ctime doesn't handle negative times in 4.2
Index:	lib/libc/gen/ctime.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	For negative GMT times, which in the USA can be positive local
	times, ctime prints out garbage.  Matter of fact it is so garbaged
	that the year has a ^A in it!   In particular, this is a problem
	with local times of 0.  gmtime() turns out to be the culprit.

Repeat-By:
	main()		/* in timezones west of greenwich */
	{	int zero = 0;
		printf("%s", ctime(&zero));
	}
Fix:
	This happened cause the types of all the "time" variables in ctime.c
	have been changed from long in 4.1 to unsigned long in 4.2.  Note that
	sys/types.h says that time_t is long, as do all the man pages.  Plus I
	seem to remember seeing somewhere in the Unix docco that negative
	times are supposed to "work."  And finally, 7fffffff is year 2038, and
	I expect Unix will be long dead by then, even if the world isn't.

	All you really have to change are the types in gmtime() itself:
206c206
< unsigned long *tim;
---
> long *tim;
209c209
< 	unsigned long hms, day;
---
> 	long hms, day;
