It is inconvenient that the default handling for
alarm clock signals is to kill the program and that
the default is reset each time a signal is recived.
Thios precludes use of the realtime alarm at rapid
real-time rates, since scheduling delays may prevent
a program from setting up to catch the signal quickly
enough.
