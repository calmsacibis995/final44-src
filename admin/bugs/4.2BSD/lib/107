Subject: bum unsigned to double conversion in 4.?bsd C compiler (with fix)
Index: lib/pcc/table.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	A variable of type unsigned (or unsigned int, or unsigned long) is
	misconverted to type double (or float) if the variable's high-order
	bit is on.

Repeat-By:
	Compile the following:
		#include <stdio.h>

		unsigned	u;
		double		d;

		main() {
			u = ~0;
			d = u;
			printf("%f\n", d);
		}
	Note the output:
		-1.000000

Fix:
	As is so often true, AT&T's corporate secretiveness precludes a clearer
	posting.  Note also that other folks almost surely have better fixes for
	this bug.  These fixes are for the 4.1bsd versions of the relevant
	files.

	Dealing with the bug involves three additions.
	The first two are used to get the C compiler to generate correct code.
	First is an addition to "cmd/pcc/table.c":

	ed table.c
	/#ifdef FORT/;/endif/a

	#ifndef OLDVERSION
	SCONV,	INTAREG|FORCC,
		SAREG|AWD,	TUNSIGNED|TULONG,
		SANY,	TFLOAT,
			NAREG|NASL,	RESC1|RESCC,
			"	cvtld	AL,-(sp)\nZG\ncvtdf	(sp)+,A1\n",
	
	SCONV,	INTAREG|FORCC,
		SAREG|AWD,	TUNSIGNED|TULONG,
		SANY,	TDOUBLE,
			NAREG|NASL,	RESC1|RESCC,
			"	cvtld	AL,-(sp)\nZG\nmovd	(sp)+,A1\n",
	#endif
	.
	w
	q

	Second is an addition to "local2.c":

	ed local2.c
	/^zzcode/;/switch/a
	#ifndef OLDVERSION
		case 'G':
			/*
			** Just did a cvtld ..., -(sp).
			** If negative, correct (sp).
			*/
			cbgen( GE, m=getlab(), 'I' );
			printf("	addd2	$0d4.294967296e+09, (sp)\n");
			deflab( m );
			return;
	#endif

	.
	w
	q

	Lastly. . .just a minute.  Will someone please tap the 'n' key on Doug
	Gwyn's terminal?  All done?  Thank you.  :-)  Lastly, a change to "lint"
	so that if you "lint -p" you'll get a warning about code that's not
	portable to sites with the distributed 4.1bsd or 4.2bsd compiler.
	The change is to "lint.c" in the "lint" source directory; you might
	want to put this change in even if you're NOT a 4.1bsd or 4.2bsd site
	if you'd like warnings about code that won't port to 4.?bsd sites.

	ed lint.c
	/^clocal/;/case SCONV/;/tl =/a
	#ifndef OLDVERSION
			if ( (t == FLOAT || t == DOUBLE) &&
				(tl == UNSIGNED || tl == ULONG) )
					if ( ((float) ((unsigned) ~0)) < 0 )
	werror( "unsigned to float conversion fails on your system" );
					else if (pflag)
	werror( "unsigned to float conversion fails on Berkeley systems" );
	#endif
	.
	w
	q
