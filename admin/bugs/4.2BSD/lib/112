Subject: Bug in syslog(3) in 4.2BSD.
Index: lib/libc/gen/syslog.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	syslog(3) fails when a %c (where c != 'm') occurs in the string
Repeat-By:
	use the following call:

	syslog ("%s: %m", "filename");

	The string is truncated after the "%s" and no newline is added.  The
	next call to syslog() (even from another program) will tack it's output
	onto the same line as the previous and be processed as one.

Fix:
	apply the following patch to /usr/src/lib/libc/gen/syslog.c
73c73
< 				*b++ = '%', *b++ = c, *b++ = '\0';
---
> 				*b++ = '%', *b++ = c;
