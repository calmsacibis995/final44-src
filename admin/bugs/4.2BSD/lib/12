Subject: C compiler bug (minor)

Index: lib/pcc 4.2BSD

Description:
	The C compiler aborts with a compiler error if function arguments
	are declared `static'.

	(I happened to notice that the code which does arguments doesn't
	check for `static's among its declared arguments; probably that
	is all that is required to `fix' it.)

Repeat-By:
	Compile this:

		foo (i)
		static i;
		{
		}
