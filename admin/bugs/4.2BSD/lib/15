Subject: srandom(1) does not always reinitialize random()
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/random.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	According to man 3 random:
		"random will by default produce a sequence of numbers
		 that can be duplicated by calling srandom with 1 as the seed"
	The following program shows this does not always work.
	It reinitializes each time it calls random() and therefore should
	always print the same number, but it does not.
Repeat-By:
	#include <stdio.h>
	
	main()
	{
		int i;
	
		for (i = 1; i < 20; i++ ) {
			srandom(1);
			printf("%12d\n", random(0));
		}
	}
