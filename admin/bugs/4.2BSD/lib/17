Subject: Enhancement to allow optional macro arguments in cpp text
Index: lib/cpp 4.2BSD

Description:
	It would often be handy to define macros that could intelligently
	handle missing arguments.  I would like to see a predefined macro,
	'ifmissing' with 3 arguments.  If the first argument was missing,
	the second argument would be the macro's value.  If the first
	argument was present (ie. a non-null string) the third argument
	would be the macro's value.  This capability is not present in
	cpp, nor is it constructable from the cpp primitives.
Fix:
	Here is a 'diff' of cpp.c with the requested macro installed:

< STATIC	struct symtab *ifmissing;
< STATIC  char *ifmissingval;

< 	if ((sp==ifmissing)&&(sp->value==ifmissingval)) {
< 		/* the predefined 'ifmissing' macro is being invoked... */
< 		if (*(actual[0]-1)) {
< 			actual[1] = ""+1; /*   arg0   ==> null, arg2 */
< 		} else {
< 			actual[2] = ""+1; /* not arg0 ==> arg1, null */
< 		};
< 	};
