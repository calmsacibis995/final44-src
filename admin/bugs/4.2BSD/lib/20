Subject: Missed optimization in sccs ver 4.12 of /lib/c2

Index: lib/c2 4.2BSD

Description:
	In the latest (unreleased?) version of /lib/c2 (don't ask how I
	got it!) you have (around like 844)

		&& bitsize[p->back->subop&0xF]>=(pos+siz)

	which can be simplified to

		&& bitsize[subop]>=(pos+siz)

	(I know, who cares!)

Chris
