Subject: execvp() uses '-' as a path delimiter
Index:	lib/libc/gen/execvp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	It seems to me that this has been complained about before, but
	since it doesn't appear to have been fixed (I just peeked on
	monet), I figure I might as well submit a report.  The problem
	is that execvp() treats '-' as separating paths in a PATH
	variable, unlike the shell.  This causes many surprises when
	'make' wants to find commands in directories that have
	hyphenated names (as I just discovered) and probably has other
	negative side-effects.

Repeat-By:
	% mkdir /tmp/a-test
	% cp /bin/echo /tmp/a-test/a-echo
	% setenv PATH /tmp/a-test:$PATH
	% cat > makefile
	hi:
		a-echo hi there
	% make hi
	a-echo hi there
	Make: Cannot load a-echo.  Stop.
	%

Fix:
	Simple:

		register char *s;
	  
		s = si;
	! 	while (*s1 && *s1 != ':' && *s1 != '-')
			*s++ = *s1++;
		if (si != s)
			*s++ = '/';

	--- 73,79 -----
		register char *s;
	  
		s = si;
	! 	while (*s1 && *s1 != ':')
			*s++ = *s1++;
		if (si != s)
			*s++ = '/';
	----------------------------------------------------------------

	After changing 'execvp.c', re-compiling it, sticking it into
	'/lib/libc.a' and recompiling 'make', the 'make' works (I tried
	it).

	If someone can give me a good reason for the '-', I'd sure like
	to hear it,
