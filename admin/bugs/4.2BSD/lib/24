Subject: cc and lint report incorrect line numbers
Index: 	lib/mip/scan.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	In some circumstances, "cc" and "lint" report incorrect line
	numbers in error reports.  The most common situation was when a
	source file started with a false #ifdef which pre-processed
	into nothing.  This commonly occurred to files which had an
	"#ifdef lint ..." at the top.

Repeat-By:

	% cc ln.c

	where "ln.c" is the following:

	-------- cut here --------
	#ifdef x
	/* Comments like */
	/* this make cc and lint report */
	/* line numbers incorrectly if x is undefined. */
	#endif
	}	/* this is a syntax error on line 6 */
	-------- cut here --------

	This will give the following error:
	"ln.c", line 2: syntax error
	whereas the error is actually on line 6 of ln.c .
	"lint" will behave the same way.

Fix:
	The problem is in /usr/src/lib/mip/scan.c, which is shared by
	cc (/lib/ccom) and lint (/usr/lib/lint/lint1).  The
	initialization of "lineno" occurs after it might be set by
	lxinit() (via lxtitle(), by input lines of the form "# nnn
	filename", where nnn is the original line number of the source
	file "filename").  The fix is to move the lineno intialization
	to preceed the call to lxinit(), in the routine mainp1() in
	scan.c:

	-------- Old: --------

  	for( i=0; i<SYMTSZ; ++i ) stab[i].stype = TNULL;
  
  	lxinit();
  	tinit();
  	mkdope();
- 
- 	lineno = 1;
  
  	/* dimension table initialization */
  
	-------- New: --------

  	for( i=0; i<SYMTSZ; ++i ) stab[i].stype = TNULL;
  
+ 	lineno = 1;	/* init this before lxtitle() is called */
+ 
  	lxinit();
  	tinit();
  	mkdope();
  
  	/* dimension table initialization */

	----------------------

	Actually, the initialization of lineno in the old version
	always clobbered its setting by lxinit(), but it was usually
	clobbered innocuously from 1 to 1.  However, files like the
	example "ln.c" above were pre-processed into something like
	this:

	# 1 "ln.c"
	# 5 "ln.c"

	}	

	and the clobbering of lineno=5 after lxtitle() processed
	the "# 5 "ln.c"" caused the erroneous line number
	reports.  This commonly occurred to files which had an
	"#ifdef lint ..." at the top.  To produce the bug, there
	must be no lines at all between the two "# nnn filename"
	lines (so that both are processed from the lxinit() call,
	not later).
