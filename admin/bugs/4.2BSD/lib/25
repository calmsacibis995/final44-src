Subject: ctypes is incompatible with system 5
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/ctype_.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The bit fields for ctype are incompatible in some
	cases with system 5 preventing portable code.
	The worst case is iscntrl('\n') is false on 4.2bsd and true
	on system 5.
Repeat-By:
	diff ctype_.c or write a program that dumps the bitfield
	of ctype_. (So you don't have to look at system5 source)
Fix:
	to be system 5 compatible add the following bits:
		(octal character)	(add)
		011			iscntrl()
		012			iscntrl()
		013			iscntrl()
		014			iscntrl()
		015			iscntrl()
		060			ishex()
		061			ishex()
		062			ishex()
		063			ishex()
		064			ishex()
		065			ishex()
		066			ishex()
		067			ishex()
		070			ishex()
		071			ishex()


	also note that system5 does not consider 040 (space) to be ispunct().

It's kind of long and boring.  Here's a "diff" between it and the
4.3BSD version, with irrelevant stuff stripped out:

The "7,8c3,4" and "24c20,36" are irrelevant.  The array has the same
size in both versions; the 4.3BSD version explicitly declares the
size, which is probably a good idea, and also renders the extra 0's
at the end superfluous.  The array does have a different name; I
suspect this was done for binary compatibility, as they probably
change the contents of the table and wanted to ensure either that
programs using the old macros would get the old table or wouldn't
build at all and would have to be recompiled.

The "10c8" is obviously irrelevant, since "|" is commutative.

The "15,16c11,12" doesn't have any effect in practice; it merely
indicates that the digits "0" through "9" are hex digits.  The 4.3BSD
"isxdigit" macro tests for "_N" or "_X", and "_X" only applies to
"a-f" and "A-F" while "_N" applies to "0-9".  The S5 macro tests only
for "_X", and "_X" also applies to "0-9".  The S5 version may be
slightly more efficient on machines with "test bit" instructions.

In other words, 4.3BSD is compatible with S5R3.
