Subject: printf fails on VAX 730 (4.2BSD...probably also in 4.3)
Index: 	lib/libc/vax/stdio/doprnt.s    4.2BSD

Description:
	The doprnt.s routine takes advantage of some undocumented
	behavior (I can't find my notes...if you need me to, I can 
	find the exact spot again) which does NOT occur on the 730.
	(N.b. the routine DOES work on the 750 and 780).  The symptoms
	are that floats printed with a %?.2f format are badly wrong
	under some circumstances (basically, a carry doesn't propagate
	accross the decimal point).  (The `?' can be several values; I 
	know that it fails for 5 and 7; I know that it succeeds for a 
	couple of even values)
Repeat-By:
	On a 750, or 780, the following statement (correctly) prints 
	1.00; on a 730, it prints 0.00

	printf("%5.2f",.999);
Fix:
	I have a version of doprnt from csh which works right; it is
	about 15% slower than the doprnt.s version, though.  I can
	send it if you really want.
