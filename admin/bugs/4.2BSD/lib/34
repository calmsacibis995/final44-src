Subject: DES function encrypt() doesn't work properly
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/crypt.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The primitive DES function encrypt() doesn't work if you call it
	directly.  For instance, if you encrypt something and then decrypt it,
	you don't get what you started with.
Repeat-By:
	/*
	 * Test DES by encrypting block of all 1's with 0 key.
	 */
	char key[64];
	char data[64];

	main()
	{
		register int i;

		for (i = 0; i < 64; i++)
			data[i] = 1;
		setkey(key);
		encrypt(data, 0);
		encrypt(data, 1);
		/* data should again be all 1's, but isn't */
		for (i = 0; i < 64; i++)
			printf("%d", data[i]);
		printf("\n");
	}
Fix:

The problem is that there are two arrays, e[], which is initialized,
and E[], which isn't. As it stands now, E[] only gets set in crypt(),
the higher-level password encryption function. There's a for-loop in the
code for crypt() which copies e[] to E[]. (Later on, E gets shuffled around.)
The fix is to take this for-loop out of crypt() and put it in setkey(),
so that E[] will get set up even if you don't go through crypt().
