Subject: structure size bug 
Index: 	lib/mip/??? 4.2BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Description:
	Two structures that should be the same size are different.  The problem
	occurs in the program below.  Run as is, it prints 100.  If lines 11
	and 12 are switched, it prints 104!  If line 12 in then changed to
	'int seven', the output remains 104.

Repeat-By:

	run the following program, then switch lines 11 and 12 and run it.

1    main()
2
3	{
4		static struct sc_ent {
5		int one;
6		int two;
7		int three;
8		char four;
9		char five;
10		char six[80];
11		short seven;	/* problem line one */
12		int eight;	/* problem line two */
13		} garbage;
14
15		printf("%d\n", sizeof garbage);
16	}
