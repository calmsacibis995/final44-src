Subject: Extremely misleading (even dangerous!) comment in bcopy

Index: lib/libc/vax/gen/bcopy.s 4.2BSD Fix

Description:  The one line comment at the tops says:
		/* bcopy(to, from, size) */
	but the man page says bcopy(b1, b2, len) copies from b1 to b2.
	The man page is right (unfortunately for compatibility).

Repeat-by:
	Yikes!  Scenario: 1) not able to find the man page and so glance at
	source, 2) surprised and grateful that there is such a comment there,
	3) pgm gets blown away, 4) much later really look at the source...

Fix:
	No, it's NOT to delete the comment....
