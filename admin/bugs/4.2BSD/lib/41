Subject: f77 routine in wrong lib

Index:	lib/libI77 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	This is my mistake: the routines ioinit.o & ioinit.f should be
	in libU77.a and not in libI77.a
	This is because they are essentially user code and refer to
	entry points in the other libs.

Repeat by:
	I believe if you just call ioinit and nothing else, the load
	will fail, eg:
		program x
		call ioinit()
		end

Fix:
	Move ioinit source to libU77, modify the makefile appropriately
	in both directories, and remake both libs.
