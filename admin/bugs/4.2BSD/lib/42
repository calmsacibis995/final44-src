This is wrong in 4.1a as well as v7.

	Newsgroups: net.bugs.v7

	As came up in connection with a recent Notesfiles failure, popen(3) as
	it comes with V7 (etc) has a bug:  it does not close the pipe descriptors
	if the fork fails.  The fix (first pointed out by Berry Kercheval of
	Zehntel) is to change the code at about line 28 from:

		if(pid == -1)
			return NULL;
	to
		if (pid == -1) {
			close(myside);
			close(hisside);
			return NULL;
		}

	There is a further bug which I came across in the course of looking at
	popen and pclose.  Since there is no way to wait(2) selectively for a
	specific process, the return code from pclose is unreliable in the
	event of multiple simultaneous popen's or other child processes.
