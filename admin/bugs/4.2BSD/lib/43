Subject: Termcap doesn't do delays at 19200 baud

Index: lib/termcap 4.2BSD

A bug in the C source for the termcap library causes no padding to be
put out for terminals running at 19200 baud.

The bug is in /usr/src/lib/libtermlib/tputs.c: the initialization list for
the array tmspc10 (shown below) is missing ", 5" at the end.

	/*
	 * The following array gives the number of tens of milliseconds per
	 * character for each speed as returned by gtty.  Thus since 300
	 * baud returns a 7, there are 33.3 milliseconds per char at 300 baud.
	 */
	static
	short	tmspc10[] = {
		0, 2000, 1333, 909, 743, 666, 500, 333, 166, 83, 55, 41, 20, 10
	};

Fixing this requires recompiling the termcap library and all
programs that use it, including vi, more, curses, ...
