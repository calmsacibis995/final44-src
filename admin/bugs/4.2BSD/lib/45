Subject: C Preprocessor bug

Index: lib/cpp 4.2BSD

The #line directive of the C preprocessor (4.1bsd) does not work
correctly.  First, the ability to override line numbers doesn't seem to
work.  Second, the #include and #ifdef (and maybe the #ifndef, I don't
know) directives cause the preprocessor to "forget" the file name that
was specified on a preceding #line.

Example:

#line 100 "yy"

xxx

will cause cc to print out the appropriate error messages (the file
name is right, but the line numbers are wrong!):

cc -c x.c
"yy", line 4: warning: old-fashioned initialization: use =
"yy", line 4: syntax error
"yy", line 4: warning: old-fashioned initialization: use =

But:

#line 100 "yy"

#ifdef	anycondition
int	x;
#endif

xxxx

will cause:

cc -c x.c
"x.c", line 8: warning: old-fashioned initialization: use =
"x.c", line 8: syntax error
"x.c", line 8: warning: old-fashioned initialization: use =


I am using the #line directive in a translator which takes as input a
C-like language and converts it to pure C.  I want the error messages
from cc to look like they're talking about lines in the original file
(not the translated file).

If fixes are available for this bug, could you please send them to me?
