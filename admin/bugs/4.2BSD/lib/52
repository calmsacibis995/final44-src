Hi guys, got two problems.

1. localtime(3) apparently is returning everything correctly, except
for the day of the year. it worked great up until '83 started, and
now is a day behind. problem was first noted in 'at' and 'atrun'. at
is generating the proper day for at files, but atrun always thinks
it's yesterday, and doesn't execute them until tomorrow.

2. vi(1) can 'lose' a new file if the user encounters an error, then
exits with 'ZZ'. the error handler calls the subroutine 'sync', which
resets the file modified flag. this only happens the first time around,
i.e., if after the error you go back and make a change, get another
error and then exit, it works properly.

Any help will be appreciated.
