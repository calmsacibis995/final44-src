Subject: stdio fseek bug

Index: lib 4.2BSD

Suppose stdin is a pipe, and your program attempts to do an fseek
back to the beginning after reading a bit.  It fails, as it should.
However, if you do subsequent reads on stdin, the rest of the block
that was buffered ready to be read has been thrown away.  The manual
is decidedly brief about what is an error condition to fseek and what
the proper behavior is, but it seems to me that if a seek is not
possible on the file, there shouldn't be any affect on the position
of the file pointer.

A really excellent implemention might (but then again might not)
attempt to emulate seeks on pipes for certain special cases where
they are reasonable.  For example, a forward seek can be done by
skipping data.  A backward seek within the same block ought to be
possible using the data that should still be buffered.
