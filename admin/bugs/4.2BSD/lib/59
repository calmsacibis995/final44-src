Subject: sleep(3) and SIGALRM
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/sleep.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	After a call to sleep(), the signal SIGALRM remains blocked.

Repeat-By:
	main()
	{
		sleep(1);
		alarm(1);
	}
	This program will never terminate.

Fix:
	In sleep.c add the following line to set the mask back to the old
	mask before returning as follows:

	(void) sigvec(SIGALRM, &ovec, (struct sigvec *)0);
	(void) setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &oitv, (struct itimerval *)0);
+++	(void) sigsetmask(omask);
}
