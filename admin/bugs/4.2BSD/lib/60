Subject: iscntrl() doesn't think HT is control
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/ctype_.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	Manual page seems to indicate that anything less than ' ' will
	return non-zero from iscntrl().  The "space characters" (HT,
	LF, VT, FF, CR) are classified as space but not as control.

Repeat-By:
    main() {
	printf("Is \\n a control character? %s\n", iscntrl('\n')? "Yes" : "No");
    }

Fix:
    Change "_S" to "_S|_C" for those five characters in the table, or
    fix the manual.
