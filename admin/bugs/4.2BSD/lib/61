Subject: ``#line n "file"''  directive ignores line number
Index:  lib/cpp 4.2BSD

Description:
	There is a bug in the handling of preprocessor lines of the form
		# line n "filename"
	The preprocessor uses this information and generates lines of the
	form
		# n "filename"
	C is supposed to use that information whenever it prints errors.
	In fact it gets the filename right, but the line number wrong.
	It seems to just keep on using its current line number (i.e.
	counting from the beginning of the input file).

Repeat-By:
	Given the source file, bug.c, containing:
	----------------
	/* bug.c */
	# line 1 "foo"
	error
	----------------
	The command "cc bug.c" prints the error messages referencing 
	"foo", line 3" It should reference "foo, line 1" instead.  Note 
	that the preprocessor is correct; it generates an output line 
	"# 1 foo".  But the error message reporters don't use the count.
