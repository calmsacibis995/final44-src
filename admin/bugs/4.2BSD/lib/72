Subject: calloc clobbers too much memory

Index: lib/libc/gen/calloc.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	calloc should round up the value passed to malloc, or should
	use bzero to zero the memory returned.

Repeat-By:
	Use a strict range-checking malloc with calloc: calloc tromps over
	the range-checkers when asked for (eg) 22 bytes.

Fix:
	Change the loop in calloc to a call to bzero (preferred), or
	round up before malloc()ing.
