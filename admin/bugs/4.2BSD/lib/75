Subject: integer pointer increments
Index: 	lib/pcc/table.c	4.2BSD

Description:
	If you declare a register variable as a pointer to a long int and
	pass it as a parameter (with auto-increment) to a short function.
	The pointer address will only increment by 2 bytes.
Repeat-By:
	Please compile and run the following program, from the second
	fprintf statement you will notice that the pointer address only
	increments by 2 bytes.

	#include <stdio.h>

	#define	cbits(n)	(unsigned short)(n)
	typedef		long	tchar;

	main()
	{

		tchar	words[10];
		register	tchar	*i;
	
		i = words;
		fprintf(stderr,"1.  i = %d\n",i);
		while(cbits(*i++))
			;	
		fprintf(stderr,"2.  i = %d\n",i);
		*i++;
		fprintf(stderr,"3.  i = %d\n",i);
		exit(0);
	}
