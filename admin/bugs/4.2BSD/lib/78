Subject: /lib/cpp gives spurious messages
Index: 	lib/cpp 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a comment is not closed, /lib/cpp says "missing endif".  This
	is not right; what is missing is an end-of-comment.  This can
	lead to time spent searching for the elusive extra #if, which
	is obviously time wasted.  I, myself, have just wasted 3 minutes,
	which at my normal consulting rates, is $2.50.  Please send
	payment.

Repeat-By:
	% cat > t.c
	/*
	hi
	^D
	% /lib/cpp t.c
	3: missing endif

Fix:
	A quick look at the code revealed no obvious solution.  It
	seems to ignore comments by treating them as #ifdef's in
	some way, and I haven't the time to trace it.  But there should
	be some simple solution somewhere.
