Subject: Lint library omission
Index: lib 4.2BSD

The standard lint library doesn't contain any mention of
the select procedure.  This is especially pernicious because
the 4.1c select is different from the 4.1a select.  Without
a lint library entry, users aren't even told that the change
has occurred.
