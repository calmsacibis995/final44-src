Subject: bug (in popen()?)
Index: lib 4.2BSD

   I have put together a modest piece of C code with one major problem. All
of the individual parts (reading from popen(ls, r), writing to two files and
two pipes) work, but if I compile it with both of the output pipes included
the result hangs when it comes to close the various pointers. If I compile
the code with all references to one or the other of the output pipes left out,
there is no problem. Replacing one of the processes being piped to (both are
sorts) with a simple "cat" does not prevent the hanging. The total number of
FILE pointers open at any one time is 6 (much less than the ~30 that can be
open). We speculate that this problem is the result of an obscure bug in
popen(). Comments?
