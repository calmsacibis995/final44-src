Subject: Possible bug with select
Index: lib 4.2BSD

Reading the code for the 4.2 kernel, I have come accross a potential bug
(I think).  In sys/sys/sys_generic.c, the select statement
copies its orguments "in", "out" "ex" into an array, "ibits".
"in", "out" and "ex" are long's, whereas "ibits" is
an array of int's.  This might cause problems with some compilers
(which ciode int's on 16 bits), depending on the value of NOFILES.

An other possible bug:  I don't think the internet code ever
checks the propoer value of the "version" field in an IP header.
