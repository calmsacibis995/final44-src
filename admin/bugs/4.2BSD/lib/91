Description: The manual description is poor/misleading/wrong:

1) namelist should be declared
	struct direct *(*namelist[1]);
and not
	struct direct *(*namelist[]);
Upon return, directory structures can be accessed (*(*namelist)[i]).
(This fact ought to be mentioned.)
2) You can conveniently only use "." for the dirname if you wish to
use select and/or compar, because the arguments to those functions
are looked for in ".", and not in dirname.  Thus, I currently use
	getwd(pathname);
	chdir(dirname);
	scandir(".",namelist,select,compar);
	chdir(pathname);
instead of
	scandir(dirname,namelist,select,compar);

Repeat-By:
	Try it yourself.

Concerning the manual description of scandir(3):

1) namelist should be declared
	struct direct *(*namelist[1]);
and not
	struct direct *(*namelist[]);
Upon return, directory structures can be accessed (*(*namelist)[i]).
(This fact ought to be mentioned.)

2) You can conveniently only use "." for the dirname if you wish to
use select and/or compar, because the arguments to those functions
are looked for in ".", and not in dirname.  Thus, I currently use
	getwd(pathname);
	chdir(dirname);
	scandir(".",namelist,select,compar);
	chdir(pathname);
instead of
	scandir(dirname,namelist,select,compar);

	Surely there's a better way!  (And I don't mean forming the
relative path name within select and compar.)

Am I missing something?
