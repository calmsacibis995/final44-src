Subject: The autoincrement for an int pointer sometime only increment the
	 address by 2 bytes.
Index: lib 4.2BSD

Description:
	If you declare a register variable as a pointer to a long int and
	pass it as a paramenter and increment the pointer afterword.
	Somehow, the address will only increment by 2 bytes.
	The function "hyphen(wp)" in the ditroff source file "n8.c" has
	the similar syntax. 
Repeat-By:
	Following is a simple program to test the problem, look at the output
	from the second fprintf statement.

#include <stdio.h>

#define	cbits(n)	(unsigned short)(n)
typedef		long	tchar;

main()
{

	tchar	words[10];
	register	tchar	*i;

	i = words;
	fprintf(stderr,"1.  i = %d\n",i);
	while(cbits(*i++))
		;	
	fprintf(stderr,"2.  i = %d\n",i);
	*i++;
	fprintf(stderr,"3.  i = %d\n",i);
	exit(0);
}

Fix:
	The problem may be in "table.c" of the c compiler.
