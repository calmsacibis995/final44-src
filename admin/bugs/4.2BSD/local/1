Subject: MH 'inc' screws up on full mailbox

Index: local/mh 4.2BSD

Description:
	When using MH, if you do an 'inc' and your inbox fills up, all
the letters get scribbled on the file ? in inbox, each overwriting the
previous. In short, you lose mail.

Repeat-by:
	Touch file 999 in your inbox, mail yourself two letters, and inc.
