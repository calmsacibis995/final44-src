Subject: Make default suffix list not as described.
Index: 	local/make/files.c 4.2BSD

Description:

In the documentation for `make', they
mention that the sequence of suffixes that `make' will try when
trying to create a .o file is .o.c.e.r.f.y.yr.ye.l.s each with their
corresponding rules. It does not work that way. Apparently .f
appears before .e and .r in the default sequence. This is a real
pain at times since .e and .r (efl and ratfor source files) are
translated into a .f file by f77 before they are compiled. If the
compilation is successful, the .f file is erased but, if it there is
an error, the .f file is left intact to allow the user to determine
what produced the error message. This means that you find the error,
then edit the .e or .r file, then must remember to remove the .f
file or your next attempt at making the program will produce the
same errors since make uses the .f file instead of the .e or .r
file.

Repeat-By:
	Set up an efl or ratfor program as described above (with errors).

Fix:
	In /usr/src/bin/make/files.c the default suffixes are defined with .f
	(and .F) in front of .e and .r.  Put .f and .F after .e and .r.
