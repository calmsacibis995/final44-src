Subject: Missing file on my ditroff distribution
Index: 	local/ditroff 4.2BSD

Description:
	I received my Ditroff and Gremlin 4.2BSD release recently.
	I was very pleased/suprised when it arrived. My distribution tape 
	however was missing the dit.install shell-script so frequently
	referred to. I have managed to get the system up but would
	like to receive the dit.install script to double-check my
	installation.
