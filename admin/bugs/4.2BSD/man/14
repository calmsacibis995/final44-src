Subject: Savecore(8) manpage missing some information
Index: 	man/man8/savecore.8 4.2BSD

Description:
	The manpage for savecore(8) should say that the number read from
	the minfree file is taken with units of 1024 bytes and does not
	include the 10% of the disk that is normally unavailable to users.

	It'd also be nice if distributin systems came with a reasonable
	minfree file set up already.

Repeat-By:
	Read the manual.

Fix:
	Add information from above paragraphs to the manual page.
