Subject: Manuel entry for DIRECTORY(3)
Index: 	man/man3/directory.3 4.2BSD

Description:
	The directory operations described in DIRECTORY(3) makes use of the 
	header file <sys/dir.h>.  Since <sys/dir.h> declares some of its 
	structures with defined types u_long, the header will not compile
	properly without first declaring the defined types by including 
	<sys/types.h>.  So the synopsis for DIRECTORY(3) should read in
	its C code:
		    #include <sys/types.h>
		    #include <sys/dir.h>
Repeat-By:
	Compile (cc) a C program with <sys/dir.h> as an include file as
	suggested by /usr/man/man3/directory.3   .
Fix:
	Precede "#include <sys/types.h>"  before the include file <sys/dir.h>.
