Subject: creat
Index: man/creat.3 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Since ancient history, the man entry for creat(2) has included
	the outright lie that creat is a good form of locking.  This
	continues to lead users astray (it fails for the super-user,
	of course).  That paragraph remains in the current creat(3) entry
	on monet.

Repeat-By:
	man creat

Fix:
	Get rid of that stupid paragraph and substitute references to link(2)
	and flock(2) for locking.

P.S:	Re bug report format:
	IF MAN IS NOT A VALID SOURCE DIR, IT SHOULD BE.  It's not listed
	in your fmt response.  Also, your fmt response implies that the
	"Index:" header belongs with the mail header section, and not
	with the body.  You shouldn't ask that, for many mail composers
	do not allow you to add your own headers.

	Also, your BNF doesn't allow for subdirs in the index line so
	I have to lie.  There ain't no such file as doc/creat.3.
	If this doesn't work I'll send the sucker back with the index
	line in the body.

	Also, your BNF says the <version> is required.  Well, lots of
	things like man pages don't have versions.
