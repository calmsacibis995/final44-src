Subject: getgroups syscall doesn't match man page at all

Index:	man/man2/getgroups.2 4.2BSD Fix
	(or sys/sys/kern_prot.c)
	and man/man2/setgroups.2

Description:
    getgroups(2) returns the actual number of grps returned in gidset,
    and its first parameter is an int, the max number of grps to
    return.  (This happens to agree with the "4.2 system manual",
    section 1.1.3.)  It returns -1 and EINVAL if the max number of
    grps specified is not large enough to hold all of them. The max number
    is NGROUPS from param.h.  The manual page, however, says that:
	1. it returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.
	2. its first parameter is an int *, and that it is value-result.
	3. the only possible error is EFAULT.
	4. the max number is NGRPS.
	5. "see also" refers to initgroups(3), should be 3x.

    The setgroups(2) man page also refers to NGRPS instead of NGROUPS.

Repeat-By:
    Inspection of sys/kern_prot.c, or run this pgm:
int gidset[20];
int ngrps = 10;
int ret, i;

main()
{
    ret = getgroups(ngrps, gidset);
    printf("ret = %d, ngrps = %d\ngidset:", ret, ngrps);
    for (i = 0; i < 20; i++)
	printf(" %d", gidset[i]);
    printf("\n");
}

Fix:
    Fix the man page(s) or change the code.  Which is it supposed to be?
