Subject: "sed" supports comments, but this is undocumented
Index: 	man/man1/sed.1 4.2BSD
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.berkeley.edu

Description:
	"sed" supports comments in scripts.  Any line containing an
	option string of white space (blanks or tabs) followed by a
	"#" is a comment and will be ignored by "sed".

	Furthermore, if the *first* comment line is of the form

		#n

	the "sed" script will be executed as if the "-n" flag were
	specified.
Repeat-By:
	Check out "fcomp" in "sed0.c".
Fix:
	Document it.  (S5's "sed" supports the exact same features,
	so it's probably been in there since V7.)
