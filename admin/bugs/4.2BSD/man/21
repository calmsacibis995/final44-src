Subject: directory(3) doc improvement

Index:  man/man3/directory.3 4.2BSD

Description:
	Naive programmer can feed opendir() the pathname of a file
	that is not a directory.  opendir(), readdir(), and friends
	will treat the file as though its contents were those of a
	directory, possibly with confusing results to the user.

Repeat-By:
	Write a program that uses opendir()/readdir() to access a
	regular data file.

Fix:
	Add a note to the manual entry directory(3) cautioning that
	it is the responsibility of the programmer to determine if
	the pathname supplied to opendir() really refers to a
	directory.

	An even better fix is to add a new library subroutine:

			isadir(dirp)
			DIR *dirp;
			{
				struct stat sb;

				return fstat(dirp->dd_fd, &sb) == 0 &&
					(sb.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR;
			}

	and advise programmers to use it after calling opendir().
