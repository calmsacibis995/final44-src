Subject: man(1) tar not clear about chown permission

Index: man/man1/tar.1	4.2BSD	Fix

Description:
	Users are not sufficiently warned that they cannot
	restore ownership of tar extractions.  The manual page
	says
		The owner, modification time, and mode
		are restored (if possible).
Fix:
	Instead say
		The owner, modification time, and mode
		are restored (if possible since only the
		superuser may restore ownership
		of another user's file).
