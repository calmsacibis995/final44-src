Subject: termlib man page bug

Index:	man/man3/termcap.3 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The description of tgetstr does not document the value returned.
	A careful reading of the document seems to imply that you are
	supposed to get the value by looking in the buffer area that
	you supply.  The real convention is that you use the char *
	value returned by tgetstr, and that if NULL is returned, the
	capability was not found.
Repeat-By:
	n/a
Fix:
	At the end of the 3rd paragraph, add:
	Tgetstr returns the value of the capability, or NULL if the
	capability was not found.
