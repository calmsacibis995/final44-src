Subject: select(2) man page incorrect
Index: 	man/man2/select.2 4.2BSD

Description:
	The manual page for select() is unclear as to whether the
	return value is the number of bits set in all the masks or the
	number of file descriptors which have a bit set in any mask,
	i.e., whether it is

		(a) numbits(readfds | writefds | specfds)

	or

		(b) numbits(readfds) + numbits(writefds) + numbits(specfds)

	The only language in the manual page dealing with this says
	"The total number or ready descriptors is returned".  This
	implies (a), since if a descriptor has a bit set in two masks,
	it is still only one descriptor, but in fact the proper answer
	is (b), the number of bits to check in all masks.

Repeat-By:
	N.A.

Fix:
	Change the last sentence of the first paragraph of the
	DESCRIPTION section of select(2) from

		The total number of ready descriptors is returned in
		*nfound*.

	to

		*Select* returns the total number of bits set in the
		masks.
