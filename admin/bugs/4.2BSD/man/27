Subject: protocol documentation
Index: man/man5 4.2BSD

Description:
	None of the Berkeley defined protocols, such as rlogin, rsh,
	rcp, ruptime, or lpd, are documented.  There should be a
	document for each protocol comparable to ARPANET RFC's.
	These documents would make it possible to implement the
	protocol from another operating system.

	It is arguable that such protocols belong in section 5, since
	they are similar to file formats.  It is also arguable that
	a separate section of the manual pages should be created.
Repeat-By:
	Try to implement a program to talk to a Berkeley daemon such
	as lpd or rlogin or rsh.
