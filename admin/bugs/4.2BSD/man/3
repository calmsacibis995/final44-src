Subject: 'ed' man entry lies by saying that 'n' cmd is available

Index:	man/man1/ed.1 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	It says the 'n' command is there but it's not.  This was
	apparently added in sys III or later.  I expect there
	are other missing commands too which are doc'ed.
Repeat-By:
	man ed
	ed /etc/group
	1n
Fix:
	Either fix man page, or get new ed (when 4.x requires a USG
	license perhaps).
