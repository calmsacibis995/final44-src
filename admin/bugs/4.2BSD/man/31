Subject: Index documentation needs expanding
Index: 	man/man3/string.3 4.2BSD

Description:
	index("my.good_chars", '\0') returns a pointer to the null at the
end of the string. While not strictly broken, the documetnation suggests
that this call should return NULL. Since the default behavior is useful,
It's probably best to change the documentation.

Repeat-By:
	Try the call in a program, and see.

Fix:
	Adding "The null is considered to be part of the string." to the first
paragraph of the DESCRIPTION section, and verifying that this is indeed true
in the 4.3 sources should be sufficient.
