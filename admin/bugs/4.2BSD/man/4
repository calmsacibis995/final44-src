Subject: Bug in manual pages for setreuid/setregid

Index:	man/setreuid 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The manual page for setreuid and setregid claim that "only the
super-user may change the real user ID (group ID) of a process".  This
is not true, inspection of the code in kern_prot.c shows that the real
user ID may be set to the effective user ID by anybody.

Repeat-By:
	man setreuid
Fix:
	Change it to read "Unprivileged users may change the real user
ID to the effective user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes."  (substitute group for user in setregid.2)
