Subject: savecore(8) manpage
Index: man 4.2BSD

The manpage for savecore(8) should say that the number read from
the minfree file is taken with units of 1024 bytes and does not
include the 10% of the disk that is normally unavailable to users.

It's also be nice if distributin systems came with a reasonable
minfree file set up already.
