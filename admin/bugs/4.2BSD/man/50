Subject: tar (5) documentation errors
Index: man 4.2BSD

  Experience shows that the documentation of the tar-header in tar (5) in
the 4.2BSD documentation is incorrect; it does not accurately describe the
file headers that the tar program writes and expects to read.

  Use of "tar cf" and "od -c" will verify that the checksum field is actually
a sequence of 6 OCTAL (not decimal) digits, padded on the left with spaces and
terminated with a NULL followed by a space, not a space followed by a NULL as
stated in the manual.

  In addition, linkflag seems to be NULL for real files, not an ASCII '0' as
documented.

The check_sum field starts at byte 224 and consists of space, space, 5, 2, 7,
1, NULL, space.  The following Null is the linkflag.

I hope this information saves someone else the inconvenience of discovering it
for themselves.
