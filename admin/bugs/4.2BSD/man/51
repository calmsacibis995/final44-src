Don, I don't know where this should go.  Thank you for forwarding it to the
appropriate place.


>From the make man page:

     Interrupt and quit cause the target to be deleted unless the
     target is a directory or depends on the special name `.PRE-
     CIOUS'.

1. Make has a race condition regarding quit and kill during commands.  The
code in await turns off interrupts while commands are being executed,
preventing the processing of these interrupts.  But the interrupts are turned
on after the command returns, at which point make will delete the target on
quit or kill.

2. A documentation error.  .PRECIOUS must depend on the target, not the other
way around.
