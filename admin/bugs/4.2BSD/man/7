Subject: Manual page for su(1) is out-of-date.
Index: 	man/su.1 4.2BSD

Description:
	The manual page for su(1) is incomplete.  For example, it does
	not indicate that a command argument may be executed in the style of
	sh -c.

Repeat-By:
	N/A.
Fix:
	Include a description of the -c and -f options (are there others?)
	in /usr/man/man1/su.1.
