Subject: Minor problem with find(1) manual page

Subject: Example in find(1) won't work with the C-shell
Index:	man/man1/find.1 4.2BSD

Description:
	The C-shell eats braces, and the syntax for the '-exec' feature
	of 'find' uses braces to indicate the position to interpolate a
	filename.  Novice users of the C-shell frequently forget to
	quote braces when using 'find', and this problem is exaggerated
	because the manual page uses the Bourne shell for its
	examples.

Repeat-By:
	The instigation for this is a Usenet posting by wall@berkeley
	which demonstrates confusion about braces and 'find'.  The
	message-ID on the article is <2343@ucbvax.ARPA>; I won't
	reproduce it here.

Fix:
	I suggest the following changes:

	----------------------------------------------------------------
	> The end of the command must be punctuated by an escaped
	> semicolon.
	< A command argument `{}' is replaced by the
	< current pathname.
	---
	> The end of the command must be punctuated by a semicolon.
	> A command argument `{}' is replaced by the current pathname.
	> Some shells treat braces and semicolons specially,
	> so it is a good idea
	> to protect them by escaping or quoting them.
	----------------------------------------------------------------

	Then there is the example:

	----------------------------------------------------------------
	< \-atime +7 \-exec rm {} \\;
	---
	> \-atime +7 \-exec rm "{}" ";"
	----------------------------------------------------------------

	The syntax of 'find' leaves much to be desired,
