Subject:  Bug in 4.2 ftp "cwd" command
To: 4bsd-bugs%ucb-vax.arpa@csnet-relay.arpa

Index:	misc/ftp 4.2BSD

Description:
	[Side note: how the * should I know what directory this belongs
	in???  We ain't runnin' 4.2 yet!]

	I tell our FTP to do a remote cwd to "pub"; I receive the message
		   vv
		550  pub: No such file or directory
		   ^^
	Judging by the message, I suspect someone's not trimming a blank
	somewhere.

	By the way, after I sent this I did a list, then tried to do
	something else, and got a "not responding: timeout" type message.
	This could be in the BBN FTP though; there are rumours of bugs
	in the "port" command.  Does 4.2 FTP use the funny port stuff?

Repeat-By:
	FTP (I am doing it from a 4.1+BBN TCP/IP system) to a 4.2 system
	and try to "cwd" to a legal directory.
