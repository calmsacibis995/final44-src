Subject: jobs in csh doesn't write to a pipe correctly
Index: new/csh 4.2

Description:
	The `jobs' command in /usr/new/csh loses its output when sent down a pipe.

Repeat-By:
	Start up a job, then pipe jobs through cat:
		tr &
		jobs | cat
	This gives no output, which is an error, it seems to me.
	On the other hand, doing:
		jobs > file ; cat file
	gives the proper output:
		[1] Stopped  tr 
	or something like that.
