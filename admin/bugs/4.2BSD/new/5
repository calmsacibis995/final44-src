Subject: mh prompter doesn't prompt
Index: new/mh/cmds/prompter.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	prompter doesn't prompt for To:, Cc:, Subject:.
Repeat-By:
	Make prompter your editor and run comp.  It will start
	reading in the body of the message.
Fix:
	In main(), change
		if(field[0] != '\n' || field[1] != 0) {
	to
		i = 0;
		while ((field[i] == ' ') || (field[i] == '\t'))
			i++;
		if(field[i] != '\n' || field[i+1] != 0) {

	Stripping off leading white space should really be done in m_getfld,
	so all the commands don't have to repeat such code.
