Subject: Suggestions for the rcs family of programs
Index: new/rcs 4.2BSD

Description:
	Suggestions:
	1.  ci should use the time on the file, not the current time, as the
	recorded time for the check in.
	2.  co should build the working file so that it has the same time of
	creation as the one recorded in the rcs file.
	3.  rcs -o (to delete a version) should at least give the option of
	merging the log remarks of the deleted version with the next version,
	so that log information is not lost.  If the most recent version is
	deleted, log remarks could be optionally discarded or retained.
Repeat-By:
	Not a problem.
