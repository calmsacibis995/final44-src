Subject: uninitialized pointer in replsubs.c in MH source
Index: new/mh/cmds/replsubs.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	In this section of code:

		char *addr(text)
		char *text;
		{
			static char buf[128];
			register char *cp, *bufp;
			int textseen, blankseen;
			char *copyaddr();
		
				.
				.
				.
					bufp = copy(" at ", buf);
					copyaddr(cp+3, bufp);
					return(buf);
				case '@':
					if(!textseen)
						return(0);
					bufp = copy(" @ ", buf);
					copyaddr(cp+1, bufp);
				.
				.
				.
		}
		
		char *copyaddr(from, to)
		char *from, *to;
		{
			/* Copies left-trimmed "from" to "to".
			 * Copy terminates on any delimiter.
			 * Returns pointer to NUL terminator . . .
			 */
		
			register char *fp, *tp;
		
			for(fp = from; (*fp == ' ') && (*fp == '\t'); fp++) ;
			for( ; NOTDELIM; *tp++ = *fp++);
			*tp = 0;
			return(tp);
		}

	Notice that the pointer ``tp'' in the subroutine ``copyaddr()''
	is not set to any value before it is used. This subroutine works
	correctly on a VAX because ``tp'' is allocated the second available
	register, which is the same register which was allocated to ``bufp''
	in the routine ``addr()'', which contains the correct value because
	it is intended to be passed to ``copyaddr()''.

	On a Pyramid, the registers used by a subroutine are not allocated
	from the same set as the calling routine, so this happy coincidence
	does not occur. ``tp'' has some random value, and the ``repl'' program
	dies of a bus error.

Repeat-By:
	Install MH on a Pyramid and run the ``repl'' command.
Fix:
	Change the code for ``copyaddr()'' to:

				for(fp = from; (*fp == ' ') && (*fp == . . .
	    /* changed line */	for(tp = to; NOTDELIM; *tp++ = *fp++);
				*tp = 0;
	    /* changed line */	return(to);
