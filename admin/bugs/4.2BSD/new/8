Subject: User contributed software package called, "spms"
Index: new/spms 4.2BSD

Description:

We received a copy of the SPMS software along with the 4.2 distribution tape
from Berkley.  It appears however that a needed piece was missing from this
tape.  Specifically, libspms.a is not to be found.  The source for this module
is missing also.

Could you possibly forward this piece to me, along with any possible bug fixes
that have been generated since the 4.2 release tape was distributed?

Thank you for your time and thank you for the software.
