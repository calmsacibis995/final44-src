Subject: RCS is core-dumping unexpectedly
Index: new/rcs/src/rcs/* 4.2BSD

Description:

I created version 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.2.1 for all of the files in the
current directory.   When 2.1.1.$ is checked out, the file SIMPLE exists.
When 2.1.2.$ is checked out, the file COMPLEX exists.   The following
shell script causes the version to be changed from SIMPLE to COMPLEX
or COMPLEX to SIMPLE.   After a number of editing sessions and 'swap's',
the ci's in the swap shell script start core dumping.   As far as I can tell 
no files were corrupted, only lock files were left behind. 

The behavior was duplicated by porting the RCS directory and files from
a SUN to a VAX 11/780 and trying again.

From sessions with adb, the apparent cause of the error is attempting to
use a FILE * that was NULL while executing in the file rcsedit.c.

cat >swap <<'funny'
#

if (-e SIMPLE) then
	echo "we've got simple files"
	ci -q2.1.1 -m"simple: $*" -Ndemo RCS/*,v
	echo "Check In Done"
	co -r2.1.2 RCS/*,v
	mv SIMPLE COMPLEX
else if (-e COMPLEX) then
	echo "we've got complex files to check in"
	ci -m"complex: $*" -q2.1.2 -Nnew RCS/*,v
	echo "Check In Done"
	co -r2.1.1 RCS/*,v
	mv COMPLEX SIMPLE
else
	echo "we've got nuttin"
endif

Repeat-By:
	Obtain a copy RCS directory that I am having the problem in and	
use the shell script listed above.
