Subject: kill with signal 0 returns wrong error code if uid wrong
Index: 	sys/sys/kern_sig.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Kill can be used with signal 0 to determine if a process exists.
	However, if the process exists but is a different uid than the
	killer it returns ESRCH instead of EPERM.  Returning EPERM makes
	it compatible with System III, as well as being more useful.
Repeat-By:
Fix:
apply following change to kern_sig.c/kill1() (line numbers may be off)
------- kern_sig.c -------

< 		if (p == 0 || u.u_uid && u.u_uid != p->p_uid)

> 		if (u.u_uid && u.u_uid != p->p_uid)
> 			return (EPERM);
