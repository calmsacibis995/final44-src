Subject: Interlan controller can hang UNIX
Index: sys/vaxif/if_il.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	A malfunctioning Interlan Ethernet controller that fails to
	set its IL_CDONE bit can hang UNIX in the if_il driver.
Repeat-By:
	You must have a controller that malfunctions in the manner
	described above.  NYIT has encountered at least one such beast.
Fix:
	In if_il.c, find code like this (it appears in several places):
		while ((addr->ilcsr & IL_CDONE) == 0)
			;
	and replace it with something that will not loop forever if the
	IL_CDONE bit never gets set by the controller.  The above
	code appears in several places in the driver; fix them all!
