Subject: RL02 must be spinning on 11/730 
Index: sys/vaxuba/idc.c 4.2BSD	

Description:
	When booting a Vax-11/730 with an RL02 disk drive on the IDC,
	if the RL02 drive is not loaded and spinning, then autoconfigure
	will not "see" the drive and you will have to reboot to get it back.
	The requirement that the RL02 drive be loaded and spun up at boot
	time is unnecessary.
Repeat-By:
	Boot a Vax-11/730 with the RL02 drive spun down.
Fix:
	This fix made life easier for us:  in the idcslave() routine
	in idc.c, replace this code:
		/* read header to synchronize microcode */
		(void) idcwait(idcaddr,0);
		idcaddr->idccsr = (ui->ui_slave<<8)|IDC_RHDR;
		(void) idcwait(idcaddr,0);
		if (idcaddr->idccsr & IDC_ERR)
			return (0);
		i = idcaddr->idcmpr;		/* read header word 1 */
		i = idcaddr->idcmpr;		/* read header word 2 */
	with this code:
		/*
		 * if there's an error now, conclude that the drive is not there
		 */
		if (idcaddr->idccsr & IDC_ERR) return 0;
		/* read header to synchronize the microcode */
		(void) idcwait(idcaddr,0);
		idcaddr->idccsr = (ui->ui_slave<<8)|IDC_RHDR;
		(void) idcwait(idcaddr,0);
		/*
		 * if drive is spun down, command will fail;
		 * just ignore the failure
		 */
		if ((idcaddr->idccsr & IDC_ERR) == 0) {
			i = idcaddr->idcmpr;	/* read header word 1 */
			i = idcaddr->idcmpr;	/* read header word 2 */
		}
