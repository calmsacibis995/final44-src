Subject: spurious code in TU78 driver 
Index: 	sys/vaxmba/mt.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Redundant code in non-data-transfer interrupt handler is
	occupying space and slowing the CPU.
Repeat-By:
	Examine code in mtndtint() in mt.c.
Fix:
	Remove the following two lines of code near the beginning of
	the mtndtint() routine:
		if (bp == 0)
			return (MBN_SKIP);
	If you read the preceding code in the routine, it will be evident
	that the condition of the aforementioned "if" test will always
	be false.
