Subject: panic crash from 3Com Ethernet driver 
Index: sys/vaxif/if_ec.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Malfunctioning 3Com Ethernet hardware can crash UNIX.  The ecread()
	routine extracts the receive-buffer number from the Receiver
	Control Register in the 3Com controller.  If the controller
	malfunctions and reports that it has received a packet in
	buffer number 0, the driver issues a panic("ecrint").
	Halting the operating system because of a faulty Ethernet
	controller is too drastic.  The operating system should simply
	report the problem and recover as gracefully as it can.
Repeat-By:
	You must have a 3Com Ethernet board that malfunctions in the proper way.
Fix:
	The best fix is to repair the hardware if it is malfunctioning.
	The following coding changes will report the problem, avoid a crash,
	and possibly even keep you on the network:
	At the beginning of ecread(), replace the line
		panic("ecrint");
	with
		{
			printf("ec%d: bad rbuf, rcr=%x\n",unit,addr->ec_rcr);
			addr->ec_rcr = (EC_READ & ~EC_RWBN) | EC_RCLR;
			return;
		}
