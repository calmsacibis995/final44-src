Subject: dhparam() exits at high IPL 
Index: sys/vaxuba/dh.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If dhparam() sets the input speed of a DH11 line to zero, it returns
	to its caller at an elevated IPL.  This can cause unnecessary
	blockage of device interrupts.
Repeat-By:
	Examine code in dh.c.
Fix:
	Before the first "return;" statement in dhparam(), add the line
		splx(s);
