Subject: premature panic can destroy hp root filesystem 
Index: sys/vax/machdep.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The dumpsys() routine in machdep.c writes the core image to the
	device specified in "dumpdev".  If GENERIC UNIX panics before
	setconf() configures dumpdev, dumpsys() tries to write the core image
	on device (dev_t)0.  If your system is MASSBUS-based, this is
	usually the root filesystem.  Result: root filesystem gets bashed.
	It's ironic that there was code in 4.1bsd to defend against this,
	but someone ifdef'ed it out in 4.2bsd.
Repeat-By:
	Introduce faulty code into GENERIC UNIX that causes a crash before
	setconf() is called.  This would probably never be done intentionally,
	but it can happen in the course of debugging new versions of UNIX.
Fix:
	Remove the #ifdef notdef and the #endif at the beginning of dumpsys()
	in machdep.c.  This isn't the best fix, but it is better than
	no fix at all.
