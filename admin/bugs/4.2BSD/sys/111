Subject: missing flexibility in Vax autoconfigure 
Index: sys/vax/autoconf.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Neither the UNIX autoconfigure code nor /etc/config understands
	that it is possible to have UNIBUS devices that do not generate
	interrupts.  Our site uses UNIBUS frame buffers that have
	registers in the UNIBUS I/O page, but do not interrupt.
Repeat-By:
	Try to configure 4.2bsd for a UNIBUS device that is incapable of
	generating interrupts.
Fix:
	Our site has modified /etc/config and autoconf.c to permit the
	use of non-interrupting UNIBUS devices.  This capability should
	be incorporated into the Berkeley distribution to make it more
	flexible.
