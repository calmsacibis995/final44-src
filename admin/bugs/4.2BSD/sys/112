Subject: unterminated standard address lists in UNIBUS drivers 
Index: 	sys/vaxuba/dn.c,lp.c,rl.c,uu.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Coding oversight in several UNIBUS device drivers.  The unifind()
	routine in autoconf.c expects to find the standard address list in
	each driver terminated by a zero entry.  The drivers dn.c, lp.c,
	rl.c, and uu.c do not satisfy this requirement.
Repeat-By:
	Examine code in aforementioned drivers.
Fix:
	Change the line in dn.c that reads
		u_short	dnstd[] = { 0175200 };
	to be
		u_short	dnstd[] = { 0175200, 0 };
	Make similar changes to lp.c, rl.c, uu.c.
