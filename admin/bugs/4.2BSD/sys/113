Subject: resuba() is not careful enough 
Index: sys/vax/sys_machdep.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a negative number is passed to the resuba syscall by the super-user,
	it is handed to ubareset(), with rather unexpected results.
Repeat-By:
	Issue the resuba syscall with a negative argument.
Fix:
	Change one line in the resuba() routine in sys_machdep.c from
		if (u.u_arg[0] < numuba)
	to
		if (u.u_arg[0] >= 0 && u.u_arg[0] < numuba)
