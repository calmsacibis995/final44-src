Subject: Vax-11/730 IDC ECC handling crashes UNIX 
Index: 	sys/vaxuba/idc.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	On a Vax-11/730, when the R80 disk requires ECC error recovery,
	the idcecc() routine is called.  This routine makes a 
	reference to the UBA page map.  The type of reference is
	apparently unacceptable to the 730, and it lets you know in
	no uncertain terms via Machine Check 9 "nonlw ioref" and,
	ultimately, a crash.
Repeat-By:
	Not quite sure... must enter the ECC code in the IDC driver.
Fix:
	In idcecc() there is a line that reads:
		addr = ptob(ubp->uba_map[reg+btop(byte)].pg_pfnum)+
	The PC of the machine check points to an EXTZV instruction
	referencing the UBA map.  This leads one to suspect that
	changing the C code to eliminate the EXTZV instruction might help:
		addr = ptob(*(int *)&ubp->uba_map[reg+btop(byte)] & PG_PFNUM)+
	But... how was this code ever tested in the first place?
	Is this the only fix that is needed?
