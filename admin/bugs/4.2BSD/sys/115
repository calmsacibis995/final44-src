Subject: tablet line discipline code is out of date 
Index: sys/sys/tty_tb.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	tbioctl() was apparently never converted to operate in a 4.2bsd
	environment.
Repeat-By:
	Examine code in tbioctl() in tty_tb.c.
Fix:
	Replace the innards of tbioctl() with this code:
		if (((cmd >> 8) & 0xFF) != 't')
			return -1;	/* don't handle this cmd here */
		switch (cmd) {
		case TIOCSETD:
		case TIOCGETD:
		case TIOCGETP:
		case TIOCGETC:
			return -1;	/* OK, but don't handle there here */
		}
		return ENOTTY;		/* all other tty ioctls are illegal */
	This code hasn't been tested:  caveat emptor!
