Subject: lint bugs in TU58 console cassette driver 
Index: sys/vax/tu.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	lint complains a lot as it grovels over sys/vax/tu.c
Repeat-By:
	Configure a 4.2bsd kernel for VAX730 and/or VAX750 and then "make lint"
Fix:
	Lots of little mods all over tu.c, all of which will be obvious
	when you "make lint".  Should have been done when the driver was
	coded.
