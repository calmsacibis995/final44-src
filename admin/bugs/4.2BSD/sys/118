Subject: 4.2bsd is too trusting with superblock contents 
Index: 	sys/sys/ufs_mount.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The mountfs() routine in ufs_mount.c fails to validate some
	critical data in the superblock before using the data.
	This can cause UNIX to crash if you inadvertently (or
	purposely) try to mount a disk with garbage on it.
Repeat-By:
	Mount a filesystem whose superblock contains an absurd
	fs_sbsize value.
Fix:
	In mountfs() before the line
		bp = geteblk((int)fs->fs_sbsize);
	add this code:
		if (fs->fs_sbsize < sizeof (struct fs) ||
		    fs->fs_sbsize > MAXBSIZE)
			goto out;	/* return catch-all error code (yuk) */
