Subject: Watchdog timer bug in lp driver
Index: sys/vaxuba/lp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If the timer interrupt goes off and there has been no activity
	in the last few seconds, the timer routine will stop sending
	if the device has been closed, even if characters still remain
	in the output buffer.  This can be a problem on slow devices,
	such as our laser printer.  (I tried sending this bug report
	a few months ago, but I never got an acknowledgment, so I'm
	resending it.)
Repeat-By:
	Get yourself a slow laser printer (like a Xerox 2700), and
	print a lot of small things.  Sometimes the last page of a
	job won't appear until the next job starts up.
Fix:
	In /sys/vaxuba/lp.c in the routine lptout, change the line:
		if ((sc->sc_state&OPEN) == 0) {
	to read:
		if ((sc->sc_state&OPEN) == 0 && sc->sc_outq.c_cc == 0) {
	This will only allow it to shut down if the output queue is empty.
