Subject: select ignores process groups

Index: sys/tty.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but select ignores
	process groups when determining whether to return true for a
	tty.

Repeat-by:
	Run the following program in the background, then hit RETURN.

	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/time.h>

	main () {
		int in, ex, sel;

		in = ex = 1;
		sel = select (1, &in, (int *) 0, &ex, (struct timeval *) 0);
		printf ("sel=%d in=%d ex=%d\n", sel, in, ex);
		exit (0);
	}

	There seems to be a relationship between this and the fact that
	select mysteriously dies if you type a ^Z followed by a return.
	(Csh tells you the job is ``stopped'' and then it vanishes from
	the list of active jobs.)
