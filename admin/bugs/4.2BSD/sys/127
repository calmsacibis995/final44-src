Subject: getmdev() doesn't iput on errors
Index: sys/ufs_mount.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	System hangs if you cause getmdev to fail by mount/umounting
	a non-block device or a 'bad' block device.  These aren't security
	holes 'cause they're super-user only, but they could bend some
	minds if /dev or /etc/fstab were messed up.
Repeat-By:
	# mknod /dev/bob b 69 0		# assuming 69 is out of range
	# mount /dev/bob /mnt
	/dev/bob on /mnt: No such device or address
	# mount /dev/bob /mnt		# system hangs
or
	# umount /dev/rhp0g
	/dev/rhp0g: Block device required
	# umount /dev/rhp0g		# hangs
Fix:
	/*
	 * Common code for mount and umount.
	 * Check that the user's argument is a reasonable
	 * thing on which to mount, and return the device number if so.
	 */
	getmdev(pdev)
		dev_t *pdev;
	{
		dev_t dev;
		register struct inode *ip;

		if (!suser())
			return (u.u_error);
		ip = namei(uchar, LOOKUP, 1);
		if (ip == NULL)
			return (u.u_error);
		if ((ip->i_mode&IFMT) != IFBLK) {
			iput(ip);
			return (ENOTBLK);
		}
		dev = (dev_t)ip->i_rdev;
		if (major(dev) >= nblkdev) {
			iput(ip);
			return (ENXIO);
		}
		iput(ip);
		*pdev = dev;
		return (0);
	}
