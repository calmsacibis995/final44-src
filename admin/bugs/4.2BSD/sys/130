Subject: lseek not checking for invalid offset
Index: sys/sys/ufs_syscalls.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	My program was issuing relative seeks, checking for a -1 return
	code, and then issuing a read, again checking for a -1 return code.
	The read did return -1 and set EINVAL.  The same arguments had been
	passed to read() in 20 previous calls.  Finally I found that the
	file offset had been decremented below zero by the previous lseek.
Repeat-By:
	printf("%d\n",lseek(fd,10L,0));
	printf("%d\n",lseek(fd,-30L,0));
	printf("%d\n",read(fd,buffer,10));
Fix:
	In lseek() copy fp->f_offset into a local variable and operate on
	it.  If the result is negative, set u.u_error = EINVAL otherwise
	store it back into fp->f_offset.
