Subject: asm label botch in sigcleanup()

Index:	sys/vax/machdep.c 4.2BSD Fix
Description:
	Someone missed putting in the required null stmnt between
	an if and an asm() to get around C compiler bug.
	Means a prober is never done.
Repeat-By:
	Source and assembly code examination.
Fix:
	At beginning of sigcleanup(), add the line
	;		/* Avoid asm() label botch */
	right after the "return;" line.
