Subject: old tty disc. flushes input on subsequent opens
Index:	sys/tty.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If user is running old tty line disc and has a partial line
	entered to the shell or in a line editor and something else
	opens his tty, his unread input is flushed.
	Typical things opening his tty might be write(1), wall(8)
	or comsat(8C).
Repeat-By:
	Log into first terminal and type 1/2 of a shell command
	or ex (line mode) line in then go to second terminal and
	do "echo Test >/dev/first-terminal", then type 2nd half
	of command on first terminal and hit return.  One will find
	only 2nd half made it in.

Fix:
	Below is last part of sys/tty.c ttyopen()
	Fix is to avoid ttyflush if not first open on OLDTTY disc.

	tp->t_state &= ~TS_WOPEN;
#if PURDUE_EE	/* stops input flush if running old tty on 2nd open */
	if ((tp->t_state & TS_ISOPEN) == 0) {
		tp->t_state |= TS_ISOPEN;
		if (tp->t_line != NTTYDISC)
			ttywflush(tp);
	}
#else
	tp->t_state |= TS_ISOPEN;
	if (tp->t_line != NTTYDISC)
		ttywflush(tp);
#endif
	return (0);
