Subject: icmp output statistics don't record replies
Index: sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	ICMP packets sent by the kernel in response to incoming ICMP
	packets (e.g., ECHOREPLYs) are not recorded in the IMCP
	statistics block.
Repeat-By:
	Send an ICMP ECHO to your host; run netstat -s and observe
	that the "input histogram" registers the request but the
	"output histogram" doesn't register the response.
Fix:
	Add one line of code (your line numbers may vary):
***************
*** 256,261
  		goto free;
  	}
  reflect:
  	ip->ip_len += hlen;		/* since ip_input deducts this */
  	icmpstat.icps_reflect++;
  	icmp_reflect(ip);

--- 299,305 -----
  		goto free;
  	}
  reflect:
+ 	icmpstat.icps_outhist[icp->icmp_type]++;
  	ip->ip_len += hlen;		/* since ip_input deducts this */
  	icmpstat.icps_reflect++;
  	icmp_reflect(ip);
