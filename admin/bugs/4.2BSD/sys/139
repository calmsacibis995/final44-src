Subject: bug in if_en.c makes ifinet point to wrong interface (Vax)
Index: 	sys/vaxif/if_en.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The pointer ifinet is used in ip_input.c to check incoming
	packets quickly, if possible.  However, on a machine whose only
	interface is a 3Mbit (experimental) EtherNet, ifinet is set
	to point to the loopback pseudo-interface, not the ethernet.
	This slows down incoming packet handling ... slightly, but
	why not get it right?
Repeat-By:
	Boot a system with a 3Mbit interface and no others.
	% adb /vmunix /dev/kmem
	ifinet/X
	_ifinet
	_ifinet:	8003a1f0
	8003a1f0/X
	_loif
	_loif:		800346b0

	Note that ifinet points to the loopback device, not the ethernet.
Fix:
	Unlike the 10Mbit drivers (if_il.c, if_ec.c, if_de.c), if_en.c
	doesn't set the if_addr.sa_family field in the attach routine,
	but only in the ensetaddr routine.  Since ensetaddr is not called
	until /etc/rc, and ifinet is set when ip_init() is called from
	domaininit(), called from main(), the family is set too late
	to make ifinet meaningful.
	
	Following the example of if_il.c et al., I changed enattach() in
	if_en.c to set the address family.  This makes things work.
