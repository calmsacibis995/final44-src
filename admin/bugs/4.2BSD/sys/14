Subject: flock() fails 
Index: 	sys/sys_inode.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	processes waiting for a flock lock will hang if someone waiting
	for the lock is killed. The ILWAIT bit never gets cleared.
Repeat-By:
	You'd have to set up a messy sequence of people waiting for
	shared and exclusive locks, then kill the right guy.
Fix:
	Either ILWAIT has to be a count rather than a bit (which could be
	decremented when the guy dies) or everyone waiting for any kind
	of flock would have to be woken up when the guy dies.
