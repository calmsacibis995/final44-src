Subject: Unix hangs during rewinds with tu77-emulating tape systems
Index:	sys/vaxmba/ht.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	We have two VAXen with Emulex TC7000 tu77-emulating tape
	controllers, one with an STC drive and another with a Kennedy
	9400.  Both systems (used to) hang during tape rewinds.  This
	is very annoying (silo overflows, etc.).  I don't think this
	problem occurs with DEC drives like tu77s but I don't have one
	to look at so I can't be sure.

Repeat-By:
	Mount a tape.  Dump data onto the tape, lots of it.  When the
	tape rewinds all serial I/O will stop until it hits BOT.

Fix:
	The problem appears to be that the system attempts to retry the
	rewind when the 'rewind starting' interrupt arrives.  Normal
	policy is to hang when the tape is busy, on the hypothesis that
	a tape operation will usually finish quickly, but rewinds are
	an exception to the rule.  The tu78 driver (mt.c) seems to
	understand this and it returns MBN_SKIP instead of MBN_RETRY
	when an 'rewind starting' interrupt comes in.  If the tu77
	driver is hacked to do the same thing, the problem goes away.
	I looked at the monet source and this hack isn't present.

	Here are the diffs:
