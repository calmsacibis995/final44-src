Subject: suspicious-looking line in sys/uipc_socket.c

Index: sys/sys/uipc_socket.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	In soreceive there is a line that reads
		if (moff+len > m->m_len - moff)
	which looks like it's wrong.  I think it is supposed to be
		if (len > m->m_len - moff)

	This would only affect efficiency of certain MSG_PEEK cases.

Repeat-By:
	examination

Fix:
	Change as in description (or to "if (len + moff > m->m_len)").

Chris
