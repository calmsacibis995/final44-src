Subject: More bogosity in MSG_PEEK stuff in uipc_socket.c

Index: sys/sys/socket.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Yet another wrong-looking line:

		if (len == m->m_len) {

	(just before using m->m_next, either by just accessing it
	or by MFREE()ing m).  If peeking and moff is nonzero,
	this if will fail when the code inside it should be done.

Repeat-By:
	examination, maybe by peeking at something that has oob data
	in the middle of an mbuf

Fix:
	replace the line with

		if (moff + len == m->m_len) {

	or

		if (len == m->m_len - moff) {
