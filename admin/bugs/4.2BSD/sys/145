Subject: "documentation" bug in sys/h/fs.h

Index: sys/h/fs.h 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	There is a minor error in the 4.2 fs.h header file.  It
	claims that super-blocks are always of size MAXBSIZE.
	This is not true; they are always SBSIZE.

Repeat-By:
	Examination.

Fix:
	Change the comment in fs.h to read

	 * Note that super blocks are always of size SBSIZE,
	 * and that both SBSIZE and MAXBSIZE must be >= MINBSIZE.

	It would probably be a good idea to note the dependency
	on MINBSIZE near the definition of MAXBSIZE in h/param.h,
	too.

Chris
