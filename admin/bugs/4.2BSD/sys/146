Subject: hard errors don't compute correct sector number
Index:  sys/vaxmba/hp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The sector number printed out after a hard error in hp.c
	is the beginning sector number of the i/o.  Perhaps not
	the one that actually caused the error.

Repeat-By:
	Get a bad disk.  Read the whole thing with differing
	size reads.  Watch the same bad sector show up
	differently.
