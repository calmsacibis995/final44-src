Subject: hard error sector numbers
Index:  sys/vaxmba/hp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Soft ecc error msgs print out the sector number
	relative to the beginning of the partition.  Hard
	error msgs print out the sector number relative to
	the beginning of the pack.  Unless you read the
	device driver, this is kinda hard to figure out.

Repeat-By:
	Find a disk with hard errors, read it using
	hp0c and hp0g and watch the same numbers how up.
