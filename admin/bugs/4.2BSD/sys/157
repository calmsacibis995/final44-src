Subject: enable delay processing in raw mode
Index: sys/tty.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	There should be a way to enable delay processing when in raw mode.
	EMACS, for example, needs it.
Repeat-By:
	CCA EMACS cannot be run on VT100 terminals without a nl delay
Fix:
	I have modified our kernel to have an additional local mode
	bit in the tty structure that means "do delay processing, even
	when in raw mode, and I promise not to output any 8-bit characters."

	Details available on request.
