Subject: "setreuid" sets p_uid incorrectly
Index: 	sys/sys/kern_prot.c 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD

Description:
	The entry p_uid in the process table normally contains the
	process' effective UID.  It is set to this value when
	a process executes a set-UID program.  However, when
	a "setreuid" system call is executed, it is set to the new
	value of the real UID, not the effective UID.

	In several places in the manual, a check against "p_uid" is
	documented as a check against a process' effective UID, so the
	current behavior of "setreuid" is incorrect.

	One may argue that a user should be able to kill a process if
	their UID (which is probably the effective UID of their shell)
	matches the real UID of the process, so that they can kill a
	set-UID process.  However,

	1) the current behavior of "setreuid" does not set "p_uid" to
	   a value other than that of the effective UID, unless the
	   process sets its real UID to one value a value other than
	   the value of the effective UID

and

	2) the proper way to make this possible is to change the permissions
	   checking code in "kill", not to change the meaning of "p_uid"
	   in some, but not all, cases.

	(System V permits you to send a signal to a process if either the
	real or effective UID of the sending process matches either the
	original set-UID UID or the real UID of the target process.  The
	reason why it says "original set-UID UID" is that a set-UID process
	which is not set-UID to 0 can repeatedly change its effective UID
	between its real UID and the UID that it was set-UID to at the last
	time it did an "exec".)
Repeat-By:
	Look at the code.
Fix:
	Line numbers may differ in 4.3.
