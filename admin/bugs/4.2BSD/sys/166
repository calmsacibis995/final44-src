Subject: panics caused by ptrace calls

Index:  sys/??? 4.2BSD

Description:
	When using a debugger (anything that uses ptrace(2), this is known
to occur when using dbx and sdb) it is possible to crash the system with
a "panic: munhash". When examining the traceback it would appear that
the problem originates when a ptrace(4,...) is made (modify childs text
segment). We are running on a VAX-11/750 with 2Mbytes real memory.

Repeat-By:
	Seems to be non-deterministic in nature. Best guess as to how to
	repeat this is to debug (using dbx or sdb) a "large" (1M or bigger)
	program and setting a breakpoint or two and starting it running.
	No guarantee that this will cause the panic however.
