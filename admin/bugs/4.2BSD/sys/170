Subject: Write to pipe with bad buffer address loses
To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Index:	sys/socket.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	A write to a pipe with a bad buffer address does not return an
error code (under 4.1a), or returns the wrong error code (under 4.2).
On 4.1a, it appears to write garbage into the pipe "forever" (longer
than I was willing to wait for it).

Repeat-By:
	Compile this program:
	main()
	{
	    write( 1, 0xabcde, 512 );
	    perror("write");
	}

	Running a.out gives "write: Bad address".
	a.out >/dev/null prints "write: Error 0" (another bug, actually).
	a.out | see prints a lot of garbage (looks like its just
	running through the buffer pool to me) on 4.1a.  On 4.2 it gives
	the error "write: No buffer space available", obviously the
	wrong error message.
