If one puts the new tty driver into raw and tandem mode (stty new raw tandem),
either explicitly from the shell or from a program, and characters come in
to that port faster than the process can empty the input queue, the driver
sends out a ^S when the buffer is half full (128 characters) and for every
character that comes in while it is still > half full; that is fine and what
it should do but it never subsequently sends out a ^Q when the buffer is 
empty (or reaches a low water mark).  Thus the equipment on the port never
knows that it may resume sending data!  Indeed, if the equipment is a T-BOX,
it is permanently hung, the only recovery being the reset button.

This may be demonstrated by entering the following commands while logged in
using a terminal which can indicate ^S and ^Q without using them for
flow control (ie. a D800B with flow control turned off and indicate (function M)
turned on):

stty new raw tandem
sleep 60\n\r

then type the letter a 129 times before 60 seconds elapses; since the shell
is waiting for sleep to terminate, it will not empty the input queue during
this time.  when more than 128 characters get in, each will be followed by
a ^S as echoed by the driver.  Once the 60 seconds have elapsed, no ^Q will
come out but more characters may be entered and no more ^S will appear.  To get
out of this you must type "stty cooked\n".  If you repeat the above test but
use "old" instead of "new", it works fine (ie. a ^Q comes out after 60 seconds).
This may sound trivial, but causes enough problems at >1200 baud to make it
unusable with UNIX, since the input queue is bound to get full once in a 
while.
