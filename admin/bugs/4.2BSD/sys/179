Subject: User id's and group id's greater than 32767 break the kernel
Index: 	sys/h/{acct.h,inode.h,proc.h,quota.h,stat.h,user.h} 4.2BSD

Description:
	Using userid and groupid greater than 32767 causes a host of
	problems in the kernel.  The most recent problem is that
	a file cannot be access by its group permission bits when its
	gid is greater than 32767.

Repeat-By:
	Make yourself a member of group 33000.
	as root:
		chgrp 33000 FileYouDontOwn
		chmod 770 FileYouDontOwn
	as you:
		touch FileYouDontOwn

	You will be denied access to the file because the kernel is
	looking at the other protection bits instead of the group bits.

Fix:
	In the .h files listed below, instert "unisgned" in the
	declaration of the given fields.

	acct.h		ac_udi, ac_gid
	inode.h		ic_uid, ic_gid
	proc.h		p_uid
	quota.h		q_uid, dq_uid
	stat.h		st_uid, st_gid
	user.h		u_uid, u_gid, u_groups
