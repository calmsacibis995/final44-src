Subject: bug in dmf32 driver and possibly others
Index: sys/vaxuba/dmf.c 4.2BSD Fix
From: Tim Morgan <morgan@uci-750a>

[I was unable to get 4bsd-bugs to accept this.  I don't know why.  Please
 file it as appropriate.  Also, could you tell me what is wrong with the
 format?]

Description:
	The dmf driver does not contain code to wake up processes which
	are select'ing on output.
Repeat-By:
	Log onto a terminal on a dmf32 or clone.  Telnet to any system,
	including the local one.  Run something on that system which will
	produce lots of output (such as cat'ing /etc/termcap).  After a
	few hundred characters, the output will stop.  It will not start
	again until you type something.  Telnet is waiting until the output
	buffer empties to write more, but the dmf driver never does a
	selwakeup() call, so the select() call never returns unless something
	else occurs, such as a character in the input buffer.
Fix:
	Here is a diff listing of the fix.  The code inserted is from the
	dz driver; it also occurs in the dh driver and possibly others.  You
	line numbers may differ.
