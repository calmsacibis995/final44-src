Subject: Re: __queue doesn't work at all

Index: sys/vax/asm.sed 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The asm.sed file replaces calls to __queue with a VAX insque
	instruction.  However, it gives bogus arguments.

Repeat-By:
	Examination, or try *using* __queue....

Fix:
	Apply diffs.  Line numbers surely off.

	RCS file: RCS/asm.sed,v
	retrieving revision 1.3
	diff -c1 -r1.3 asm.sed
