Subject: dmfprobe
Index: sys/vaxuba/dmf.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The dmfprobe() routine doesn't check for existence of the device,
	it just returns a "yes" in all cases.  This means if you configure
	your dmf's as being on "uba?" and they are not actually on uba0,
	they will never be found.
Repeat-By:
	Obvious.
Fix:
	Unless there's a reliable way to force an interrupt one must always
	specify the uba number explicitly, contrary to the dmf entry in
	chapter 4 of the manual.
