Subject: Sharing of non-text segments
Index: 	sys/sys/vm_text.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	xalloc allows shared "text" on segments that are not tagged as text
	segments. This (minimally) creates a security hole.
Repeat-By:
	Copy your favorite shell into your current directory under the
	name "x". Run "adb -w /bin/nm", :s the resulting process until
	adb reports that it is running. Now feed adb the following line:

		0?W 8fdd0000 1b 0defdd 2fb0000 0ef 0bc000000 1900780b 0 0

	(this is a short program to execl x). ^Z out of adb, and run
	/bin/nm. Note that you are now running a the shell copied into x.
Fix:
	Convince xalloc that it shouldn't use non-text segments as shared
	text. To fix the above behavior, ptrace could be modified to tag
	the written-on segment in some other way.  Both fixes might be
	appropriate.  The fix to xalloc looks like so:
