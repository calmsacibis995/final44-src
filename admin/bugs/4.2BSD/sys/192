Subject: Mounting non file systems
Index: sys/sys/ufs_mount.c 4.2BSD
Date: 06 Feb 85 17:21:37 PST (Wed)
From: mwm@ucbtopaz.CC

Description:
	The mount system will crash the system if the mounted fs doesn't
	have a bad superblock (everybody knows that, right?), even if
	FS_MAGIC in the sblock is wrong.
Repeat-By:
	Scribble garbage on an unused file system and verify that it has
	a bad FS_MAGIC by trying to fsck it.  Mount the file system, and
	watch the system crash.
Fix:
	Move the test for bad FS_MAGIC and bad MAXBSIZE to before trying
	the geteblk. Diffs follow:
