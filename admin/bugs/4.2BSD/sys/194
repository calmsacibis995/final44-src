Subject: 4.2BSD UDA50 Error reporting Inconsistencies

Description:
    Running unix 4.2bsd on a VAX-11/780's with single  UDA50's and multiple
    RA81's and RA60's.

    Error messages in some cases indicate unit 0 as subject of problem
    when in fact it's another unit causing the problem.

		ra0b: hard error sn0 OFFLINE

    Unit one was the one left powered down??  This makes us wonder about
    other error messages and what they are telling us.

    The version of the uda driver that we are running came from MIT and I
    thought was a version of the DEC ultrix driver, based on a berkeley
    driver.  The following is some of the header information from the
    driver.

Repeat-By:
	Turn off one of the disk units other than zero and then look at the
	offline messages. It should print on console;

		ra0b: hard error sn0 OFFLINE
		ra0b: hard error sn0 OFFLINE
		ra0b: hard error sn0 OFFLINE

What-I-Really-Want:
    I would like your uda "ULTRIX" driver which I understand was
    resently given to you for redistribution.  It is suppost to fix some
    bugs, if not the above, in the distribution version.

    If you know of a better version please let me know.

		Thank you for any help,
