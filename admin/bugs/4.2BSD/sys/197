Subject: RCS rev 4.2 dmf driver lacks selwakeup() call
Index: sys/vaxuba/dmf.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The driver for the dmf terminal multiplexor does not wake up
	processes waiting on a select for a device attached to it.
	The problem showed up when using telnet, which makes heavy
	used of select().
Repeat-By:
	Telnet to some other host.  Sometimes the output from logging
	on to that host (e. g., the motd) will not be fully displayed
	until you enter some data from the keyboard.
Fix:
	The following diff's (< old versus fix >) show the code that
	was installed in dmf.c, ala dh.c.
