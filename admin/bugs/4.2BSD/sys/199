Subject: ksh/sh incompatibility

Index:	sys/newvers.sh 4.2BSD

Description:

We recently installed  Korn shell as /bin/sh on our 4.2BSD 170.
I thought you might be interested to know of an incompatibility
with the Bourne shell which is not easily fixed.

When one recompiles the 4.2BSD kernel, it invokes a shell script containing:

if [ ! -r version ]; then echo 0 > version; fi
touch version
awk '	{	version = $1 + 1; }\
END	{	printf "char version[] = \"4.2 BSD UNIX #%d: ", version > "vers.c";\
		printf "%d\n", version > "version"; }' < version
echo `date`'\n";' >> vers.c

Notice the \n inside the quoted string.  Since ksh has the System V echo
command built into it, it doesn't get /bin/echo, but echo is done in
the shell.  The \n isn't left alone, but is turned into a newline.
This creates C code which cc will not accept because it has a newline
in a character string constant.

char version[] = "4.2 BSD UNIX #4: Tue May 14 09:21:28 EDT 1985
";

On a Sun, it's even worse, the last line reads:

echo `date`'\nCopyright (c) 1984 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.\n";' >> vers.c

creating a real mess:

char version[] = "Sun UNIX 4.2 Release 1.3beta (x) #2: Tue May 14 09:17:00 EDT 1985
Copyright (c) 1984 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
";

I don't even see how to rewrite the shell script to work portably
no matter which shell /bin/sh is.

I could argue that sh has no business interpreting things inside
single quotes, but I suppose that for upward compatibility with echo
on System V it has to be like this.

Perhaps the best solution would be for Berkeley to adopt the System V
echo command conventions (the differences cause a lot of problems anyway)
and then fix this shell script accordingly.

Sidebar - what happened to the \n inside the printf in line 5?
You probably didn't really want it there - the current behavior is
correct, but this may be a bug.

Repeat-By:
	Install the Korn shell as /bin/sh
	relink the kernel
