Subject: "Arg list too long" is TOO SHORT
Index: sys/h/param.h 4.2BSD
Date-Really: years ago

Description:
	5120 was too small.  10240 is too small.
	Someday someone should fix the kernel to use some virtually
	unlimited limit of buffering the arg list on its way to a
	new process.

	But in the meantime, would you please bump this up to .25MB
	or so so that people would have to intentionally limit it,
	and so that we binary licensees won't have to nag our licensors.
	Thanks.

Repeat-By:
	some-command `find /`

Fix:
	Increase NCARGS in /sys/h/param.h by some drastic amount,
	or use virtual memory to pass arguments or use a linked list
	of swap block or something.
