Subject: 4.2bsd ts driver allows O_RDWR without write ring +FIX
Index: sys/vaxuba/ts.c  4.2BSD  Fix

Description:	The TS11/TU80 driver allows opens with mode O_RDWR
		even if there's no write ring.	All the other tape
		drivers require a write ring for O_RDWR mode.
Repeat-by:	Load a tape without write ring, open the drive for
		reading and writing, and try writing.  The open
		will succeed but the writes will fail (errno=EIO).
Fix:
