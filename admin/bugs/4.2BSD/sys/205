Subject: 4.3bsd hp.c partitions too big

Index: sys/vabmba/hp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The bad144(8) writeup in the 4.2bsd UNIX Programmer's Manual reads
	(in part):
		The bad sector information and replacement sectors are
		conventionally only accessible through the "c" file system
		partition of the disk.

	Although clearly an effort was made to have this be so, the bad sector
	information and replacement sectors of rm05's or rm80's can be accessed
	(and clobbered) through the "f" and "g" file system partitions if you
	use the "hp.c" in the beta version of 4.3bsd running at UC San Diego.
	The same may be true of other types of disk; rm05's and rm80's are what
	we have.

Fix:
	I believe these are the changes to "hp.c" to ensure that bad sector
	information and replacement sectors can only be accessed through the
	"c" file partition.

	The first change is to the "rm05_sizes" table in "hp.c":

> #ifdef OLDVERSION
> 	86240,	681,		/* F=cyl 681 thru 822 */
> 	158592,	562,		/* G=cyl 562 thru 822 */
> #else
> 	32*19*(823-681)-(32+126), 681,	/* F=cyl 681 thru 822 less bad sector */
> 					/* 86178 512-byte sectors net */
> 					/* 43089 1024-byte sectors */
> 	32*19*(823-562)-(32+126), 562,	/* G=cyl 562 thru 822 less bad sector */
> 					/* 158530 512-byte sectors net */
> 					/* 79265 1024-byte sectors */
> #endif

	The second change is to the "rm80_sizes" table in "hp.c":

> #ifdef OLDVERSION
> 	120559,	281,		/* F=cyl 281 thru 558 */
> 	192603,	115,		/* G=cyl 115 thru 558 */
> #else
> 	31*14*(559-281)-(31+126), 281,	/* F=cyl 281 thru 558 less bad sector */
>  					/* 120495 512-byte sectors net */
> 	31*14*(559-115)-(31+126), 115,	/* G=cyl 115 thru 558 less bad sector */
>  					/* 192539 512-byte sectors net */
> #endif

	In each of the expressions of the form
		31*14*(559-115)-(31+126)
	the first number is the number of sectors per track,
	the second is the number of tracks per cylinder,
	the third is the number of cylinders per disk,
	and the fourth is number of the starting cylinder for the partition.
	The result of the multiplications is the number of sectors that you'd
	have in the partition if it were to include the bad sector stuff. 
	The fifth number is the number of sectors per track--
	the last track on the disk is used to hold bad sector information--
	and the sixth number, 126, is the number of bad sector replacement
	sectors used in DEC's scheme.  The sum of these last two must be
	subtracted from the result of the multiplications for the "bad sector
	sectors" to be excluded from the partition.
