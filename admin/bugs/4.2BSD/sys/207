Subject: flock(3) can deadlock

Index:	sys/sys/kern_descrip.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Advisory locks applied by flock(3) aren't removed when a process's
	files are closed and other processes have the same file open.

Repeat-By:
	Put the following program in file "flock.c".
----------------------------------- Cut Here ----------------------------------
# include "sys/file.h"
# include <stdio.h>

char	c;

int	fd;

main ()
	{ if ((fd = open (".", O_RDONLY, 0)) == -1)
	  { perror (".");
	    exit (1);
	  }
	  while (read (0, &c, 1) == 1)
	  { switch (c | 040)
	    { case 's':
	      case 'r':
		printf ("shared ... ");
		fflush (stdout);
		printf ("done(%d)\n", flock (fd, LOCK_SH));
		continue;
	      case 'x':
	      case 'e':
	      case 'w':
		printf ("exclusive ... ");
		fflush (stdout);
		printf ("done(%d)\n", flock (fd, LOCK_EX));
		continue;
	      case 'u':
		printf ("unlock ... ");
		fflush (stdout);
		printf ("done(%d)\n", flock (fd, LOCK_UN));
		continue;
	      default:
		continue;
	    }
	    break;
	  }
	  exit (0);
	}
----------------------------------- Cut Here ----------------------------------
	Compile the program:
		% cc -o flock flock.c

	Login in on two different terminals, tty1 & tty2.
	Start the "flock" program on both terminals.
	Type "s<return>" on the first terminal.
	Type "x<return>" on the second terminal.
	Type "x<return>" on the first terminal.

	Both processes are now hung.  One of them should have continued.

	Abort the process on the second terminal.

	The process on the first terminal is still hung.  This is wrong.

	Abort the process on the first terminal.
	Start the "flock" program on the first terminal.
	Type "x<return>" on the first terminal.

	The process should not have hung.

	Change out of the home directory on both terminals.
	Change back into the home directory on both terminals.
	Start the "flock" program on the first terminal.
	Type "x<return>" on the first terminal.

	The process can now apply an exclusive lock successfully.
