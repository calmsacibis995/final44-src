Subject: 4.2 file system bug leads to system hang

Index: 	sys/ufs_alloc.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	There is a buffer etiquette bug in the cylinder group resource
	allocation routines `alloccg' and `ialloccg'.  It causes a
	system buffer covering the cylinder group resource counts to be
	marked BUSY which eventually causes other processes to be
	blocked with inodes locked.  If there are sufficiently many
	processes trying to create, extend, or remove files from that
	cylinder group, the root inode will be locked and the system
	will appear to be hung.

Repeat-By:
	A prerequisite for this to happen is that a file system must
	have become full or almost full so that the resource counts
	in the cylinder groups are zero.  The way the problem has
	occurred on decvax (and on cbosgd) was for the file system
	containing the uucp spool directories to become almost full.

Fix:
	Add a "brelse(bp)" before the "return(NULL)" and surround
	with curly braces, thus:


491:	if (cgp->cg_cs.cs_nbfree == 0 && size == fs->fs_bsize)
+++		{
+++		brelse(bp);
		return (NULL);
+++		}


685:	if (cgp->cg_cs.cs_nifree == 0)
+++		{
+++		brelse(bp);
		return (NULL);
+++		}
