Subject: tcp packet with options corrupts mbufs
Index: sys/netinet/tcp_input.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a packet includes tcp options, the m_len and m_off fields of
	the mbuf are set incorrectly.  I had this happen on a 4.1 system
	with 4.2 ipc added, but a glance at the 4.3 code indicates that
	the problem exists there as well.

Repeat-by:
	Send packets with tcp options to a system running 4.2 or 4.3.  We
	had someone who ran the "mget" command from "ftp" and consistantly
	got "panic: trap" in the bcopy called from sballoc.  He was sending
	files from a Gould to a Vax.  Bcopy was passed a length of -8.

Fix:
	In tcp_input(), change:
		/*
		 * Drop TCP and IP headers.
		 */
		off += sizeof (struct ip);
		m->m_off += off;
		m->m_len -= off;
	to:
		/*
		 * Drop TCP and IP headers.
		 */
		m->m_off += sizeof(struct tcpiphdr);
		m->m_len -= sizeof(struct tcpiphdr);

	Notice that this only makes a difference if the test
		if (off > sizeof (struct tcphdr))
	was true.
