Subject: Missing file from first update to 4.3beta release
Index: 	sys/kern_exit.c 4.2BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.ARPA

Description:
	In kern_exit.c of the original 4.3 beta release there
	was a call to spgrp() of the form

		(void) spgrp (q, -1);

	The first update to the beta release (the one that was
	the giant compressed tar file) contained a new kern_exit.c
	that changed this call to

		(void) spgrp(q);

	Unfortunately, the file with the corresponding change,
	kern_proc.c, was not included in the update.  This causes
	exiting processes to have their and their children's
	process group set to random numbers.  This causes all sorts
	of bizzare behavior.
Repeat-By:
	Inspect the code in kern_exit.c and kern_proc.c
Fix:
	Grab a new kern_proc.c from monet.
