Subject: TM78/TU78 driver doesn't support two TM78 formatters
Index: 	sys/vaxmba/mt.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If there are two (dual-ported) TM78 tape formatters, each
	with one TU78 transport attached, on the MASSBUS, only
	the first can be used.  Autoconfig seems to find both
	formatters and transports, but i/o operations to the second
	will fail.
Repeat-By:
	Configure a 750 as above, mount a scratch tape on both
	transports, set port select switches appropriately, and try
	mt -f /dev/mt? status.  For mt0 you get the expected status
	message.  For mt1 you get "mu0: not online."  Routine mtopen
	has failed.
