Subject: bug in 4.2bsd ut.c
Index: sys 4.2BSD

Sorry if this has been out before, what happened to posting of
mtxinu bug list?

/*	ut.c	6.1	83/07/29	*/
In 4.2bsd vaxuba/ut.c, line 248 is out of place it should be before
the if (...) {, not in it.  The line:

		um = tjdinfo[tjunit]->ui_mi;

This bug is not present in any other uba driver.  I have never used
this driver, however I happened to randomly pick ut.c to copy for
a new driver.  Can you beat that kind of luck?
