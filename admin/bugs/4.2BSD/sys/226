Subject: Certain disk quotas crash 4.2BSD
Index: sys 4.2BSD

Description:
	I wanted to use the quotas system to prevent students
	from using back-door techniques for getting disk storage
	on other logical disks. The first idea was to set their
	quotas to 0 but that seems to mean infinite. The second
	idea was to set it negative but that means transfinite
	(treated as unsigned). The final try was to set hard to
	1 and soft to 0. The system crashed with a panic
	(something like 'could not allocate inode'), should be
	easy to reproduce.
Repeat-By:
	as stated above. I obviously was loathe to try this one
	over and over.
Fix:
	Either the syscall setquota should refuse to accept
	'illogical' values or everyone else should treat them
	as 'no more quota'. I suspect the former is more reasonable
	returning with an EBADARG or thereabouts.
