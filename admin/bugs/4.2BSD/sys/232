Subject: Possible bug in socket binding
Index: sys 4.2BSD

When trying to install 'talk' on a standalone (i.e., not
yet, but soon to be connected to an ethernet) 750 running
4.2bsd, one would always get an error that said that talk
could not bind to control socket.  Turns out that one must
have the ethernet board installed to alleviate the problem.
I would think that the kernel should take care of any local
activity and not go to the net.  It is true that the config-
uration file for the kernel contained an entry for the ethernet
board, but I would think that it shouldn't matter whether the
board was there or not (I mean if it doesn't interrupt then
its not there and the system should know this).  Please clue
me in as to what is going on, or is this a real bug?
