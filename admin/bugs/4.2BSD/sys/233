Subject: Killer bug
Index: sys 4.2BSD

We have (I am VERY sorry to say), recently come across a horrible
bug in 4.2 bsd.  The following little program will result in the 
truncation of any (I repeat, any), file that you choose to use it on,
with the one restriction that you must have read permission on the
file stipulated in the open call.  Note that write permission is not
required.

It seems that the code in the open routine has invalid logic related
to checking for permissions when asked to truncate.

Therefore if this program is run as it is shown below, it truncates the
root directory file, and the system looses its ability to find any commands
and/or files, bringing it down to its knees.

Were you folks aware of this problem, and more importantly, can we get a fix?
I would really appreciate hearing from you!
