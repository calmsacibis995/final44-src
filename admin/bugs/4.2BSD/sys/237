Subject: Bug in 4.1c generic tty driver
Index: sys 4.2BSD

A bug that might be interesting to those using Un*x on machines
other than Vaxen - 

In tty.c, the function scanc()  (which is replaced by a sed script
on vax and sun versions) returns an incorrect value.  As you
can verify by looking up the scanc instruction in the Vax Architecture
handbook, scanc leaves the number of bytes remaining in r0.  The
scanc() function incorrectly leaves an index to the character which
fit the mask. So the "return (i);" should be changed to

	return (size - i);

It means the difference of the tty working and not working!!

Hoping its not too late for 4.2 ...
