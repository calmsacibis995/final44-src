[Return receipt requested]

	I just tried booting 4.1c on a vax 750 with a genuine DEC
RH750 and 2 RM05's.   It correctly found and identified the first
drive as an RM05, but identified the second RM05 as a CDC 9775 in
"direct mode".  I don't have a fix, but it looks like some one
broke hpmaptype() when the code for SI's was added.  If you already
have this fixed, I'll just wait but I if you need a fix for it,
send word and I will dig in.

					Cheers,

PS.  Easy mistake to make, no one uses real DEC peripherals...  Sigh.
