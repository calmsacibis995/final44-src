Subject: exec with bad arguments crashes system
Index: sys 4.2BSD

Description:
	Here's the problem: exec doesn't check for validity of arguments.
	representative piece of code:

		char *arg[] = { (char *) -1 } ;
		char *env[] = { (char *) -1 } ;

		main()
		{
			execve("/bin/who", arg, env);
		}

Repeat-By:
	compile the above and run it. Be ready to reboot. Sometimes
	it might have to be run twice before anything happens.

Fix:
	I don't know. I suppose exec has to do the right thing
	with respect to validity of pointers argv and envp
