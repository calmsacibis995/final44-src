Subject: if.h missing from Oct 5 update tape
Index: sys 4.2BSD

Description:
  The 4.2 BSD update tape which we are now installing at CFO
  lacks an update for if.h whose newly defined
  constant is used in the updated if_ether.c .
  Since I picked up if.h from Monet our own needs have been met.
  
  The update tape i refer to has this date on the first tar'ed file:
  rw-rw-r--953/10  15638 Oct  5 17:40 1983 update.ms
  
  The /usr/include/net/if.h file grabbed from Monet is headed:
  /*	if.h	6.2	83/08/28	*/
  
  and it makes this new definition:
  #define	IFF_NOARP	0x80		/* no address resolution protocol */
  
  sys/netinet/if_ether.c from the update tape has this line:
  	if ((ifp->if_flags & IFF_NOARP) || lna >= oldmap) {
