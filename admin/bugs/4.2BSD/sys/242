Subject: rm03/rm05 drives
Index: sys 4.2BSD

Description:

	In some cases DEC rm03 and rm05 drives may be misidentified by
	the code in hpattach as a non-DEC drive on a non-DEC
	controller.  This problem appears in most parts of the system
	that have to identify a drive, including the COPY and FORMAT
	programs on the distribution floppy.

Repeat-By:

	The problem will occur with any rm03 or rm05 whose serial
	number maps to one of the ones that is used to detect Systems
	Industries controllers and drives.

Fix:

	If there are no systems industries drives on a system, then the
	code that identifies such drives can be removed without harm
	(which is what we did, as we don't plan to ever use SI
	controllers).  If there is a mix of drive types, then the fix
	will be much more complex.
