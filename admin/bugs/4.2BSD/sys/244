Subject: argument type mismatch in select (potential bug)
Index: sys/sys_generic.c 4.2BSD Fix

Descrption:
	The arguments passed to the select system call are 3 longs,
	which are copied into an array of 3 ints (ibits), then
	back from obits.  The manual entry for select specifies those
	3 arguments as "int *readfds, *writefds, *exceptfds".
	This is non-portable to machines where an int is 2 bytes,
	if NOFILES>15.

Repeat-by:
	Reading the code (lines 254, 273-275, etc.)
	and manual entry for select(2)

Fix:
	declare all the above variables as longs.
