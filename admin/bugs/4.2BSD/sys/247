Subject: htons should be ntohs
Index: sys/netinet/in_pcb.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	For form's sake, an htons() call in in_pcbbind should really be an
	ntohs() call.  (It really doesn't matter that much, as they do the
	same thing on most machines.)
Repeat-By:
	See above.
Fix:
	The line (around 65) should read:
		u_short aport = ntohs(lport);
