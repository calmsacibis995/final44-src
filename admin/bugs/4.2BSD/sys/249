Subject: More SIGCONT vs. sigpause()
Index: sys 4.2BSD

The changes to kern_sig.c that I sent don't fix things (in fact they
make SIGCONT behave weirdly).  I've decided not to bother fixing it
since:

a) one can kludge around it with a dummy routine and
b) it just might break existing programs that don't know or care
   about ^Z and SIGCONT.
