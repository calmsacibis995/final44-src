Subject: bug report
Index:  sys/sys/ufs_bio.c 4.2BSD

Description:	With the new struct uio stuff, the current file
		offset (in bytes) is no longer available to any low
		level routine called by physio.  The only thing you
		can get at is bp->blkno, but this has aleady been
		truncated to a 512 byte block number.  While it's
		true that most devices can't do byte addressing,
		some can and do.

Repeat-by:	<read the code>

Fix:		Two fixes possible.  Quick fix is to have drivers
		that care about byte offsets set a driver-global
		variable to uio->uio_offset in the read/write routine
		before physio is called.  Other fix would be to pass
		uio pointer to device strategy routine.
