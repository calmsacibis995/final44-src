Subject: IP fragmentation fix (correction to earlier fix)
Index: sys/netinet/ip_output 4.2BSD

Description:
	Packets that are already fragmented when they arrive at a gateway are 
	not fragmented correctly a second time. Specically, the offset of
	the new fragments are not set correctly and the MORE_FRAGMENT bit is 
	not propagated 	correctly.
Repeat-By:
	Send an already fragmented packet through a gateway that must 
	fragment the packet further. The packet will never be reassembled 
	at the receiving end.
Fix:
*NOTE* A fix to this problem was posted a month ago, but it did not set the 
MORE_FRAGMENTS bit in the IP header correctly. Specifically, the MORE_FRAGMENT
bit was always cleared for the last fragment of the packet being fragmented. 
This was incorrect in the case that the packet being fragmented already was
a fragment (i.e had the MORE_FRAGMENT bit set).
