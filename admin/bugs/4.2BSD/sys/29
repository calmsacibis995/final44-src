Subject: pty's should expand timing chars into nulls for ptcread()
Index: 	sys/tty_pty.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Using pty's as a link to remote sites means characters read from
the ptc side get sent to the remote terminal.  When these characters are
02xx timing characters they are sent directly.  This means that if the
user tty program doesn't translate them, the terminal gets broken.  Since
the user terminal program generally doesn't know whether the pty is in raw
vs cooked mode, it isn't a simple thing for it to expand those timing
characters properly.

Repeat-By:
	We have seen the problem with a non-translating server for remote
terminals.  Because the timing characters are not translated, the terminal
gets broken.

Fix:
	Add code in ptcread() to check for cooked mode and if cooked, to
translate the timing characters into an appropriate number of nulls for the
current speed that the terminal is operating at.

PS:
	Please add me to the bug mailing list.
