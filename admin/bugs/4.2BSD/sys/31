Subject: bad byte-swapping routine distributed with 3mb Xerox ethernet driver
Index: 	sys/vaxif/if_en.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The enswab() routine included with if_en.c in 4.2 has my name
	on it, but it is NOT what I wrote and it does not work.
	Presumably, it was more important for it to pass lint than
	for it to work.  I wish they didn't leave my name in when
	they don't put their names in.
	
	Also, the routine should be careful about bogus lengths.
Repeat-By:
	Compile your kernel with SWABIPS turned on and try to use the
	3mb interface.
Remark:
	The right way to handle this interface is to byteswap all packets
	on input and output, since the interface itself byteswaps all
	packets (thus the two swaps cancel out.)  So, SWABIPS should really
	be UNSWABEN, or something like that.
Fix:
	Replace the code at the end of /sys/vaxif/if_en.c with:
	
/*
 * Swab bytes
 * Jeffrey Mogul, Stanford
 * If you modify this code, please remove my name.
 */
enswab(from, to, n)
	register unsigned char *from, *to;
	register int n;
{
	register unsigned long temp;

	if ((n <= 0) || (n > 0xFFFF)) {
		printf("enswab: bad len %d\n", n);
		return;
	}
	
	n >>= 1; n++;
#define	STEP	{temp = *from++;*to++ = *from++;*to++ = temp;}
	/* round to multiple of 8 */
	while ((--n) & 07)
		STEP;
	n >>= 3;
	while (--n >= 0) {
		STEP; STEP; STEP; STEP;
		STEP; STEP; STEP; STEP;
	}
}
#endif
