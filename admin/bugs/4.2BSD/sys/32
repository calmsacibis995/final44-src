Subject: basically cosmetic bug in if_ether.c
Index: 	sys/netinet/if_ether.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When you send out an ARP packet, the packet length is
	too big.
Repeat-By:
	All arp packets generated have this bug.
Fix:
	In arpwhohas, change
		m->m_len = sizeof *ea + sizeof *eh;
	to
		m->m_len = sizeof *ea;
