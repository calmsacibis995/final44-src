Subject: uda50 driver
Index: 	sys/vaxuba/uda.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If there is no drive with unit number 0 on a uda controller the
	driver never recognizes the response to the "set controller
	characteristics" command, because that packet always has
	mscp_unit == 0 and the udip[][] entry for the controller and
	unit is checked before the type of the packet.
Repeat-By:
	Try configuring the system with no disk at drive 0 on a uda
	controller, and setting the unit plugs accordingly.  DEC
	installed our ra81's with plugs #1 and #2 and wouldn't give us
	a spare plug.
Fix:
	Here is a `diff uda.c.distributed uda.c.ourversion`:
