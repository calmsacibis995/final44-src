Subject: TCP Max segment size default is wrong
Index: sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c 4.2BSD fix

Description:
	In a letter of 7 Nov 1983, Jon Postel clarified the TCP max
	seg option default and its relation to the IP Maximum Datagram
	Size. The basic message was that the defaul Max Seg Size should
	be 536, not 512 (as in 4.2).
Repeat-By:
	Open a TCP connection, I guess.
Fix:
	In tcp_subr.c$tcp_newtcpcb(), change

  	/*
  	 * If the default maximum IP packet size is 576 bytes
  	 * and a standard IP header is 20 bytes, with a TCP
  	 * header of 20 bytes plus the options necessary to
  	 * upgrade it to something higher, then initialize the
  	 * maximum segment size to 576 - (20 + 20 + 8 + slop).
  	 */
 	tp->t_maxseg = 512;		/* satisfy the rest of the world */
  	tp->t_flags = 0;		/* sends options! */
  	tp->t_inpcb = inp;
  	inp->inp_ppcb = (caddr_t)tp;
  	return (tp);


	to

  	/*
  	 * If the default maximum IP packet size is 576 bytes
  	 * and a standard IP header is 20 bytes, with a TCP
  	 * header of 20 bytes plus the options necessary to
  	 * upgrade it to something higher, then initialize the
  	 * maximum segment size to 576 - (20 + 20 + 8 + slop).
  	 * But Postel says make it 536; see <INC-PROJECT, MAX-SEG-SIZ.NLS.14>
  	 * and letter of 7 Nov 1983.

 	tp->t_maxseg = 536;		/* satisfy the rest of the world */
  	tp->t_flags = 0;		/* sends options! */
  	tp->t_inpcb = inp;
  	inp->inp_ppcb = (caddr_t)tp;
