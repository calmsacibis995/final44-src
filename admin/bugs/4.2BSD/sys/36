Subject: TCP connections hanging forever in FIN_WAIT_2 state
Index: 	sys/netinet/tcp_input.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	TCP connections with TOPS-20 systems occassionally hang in
	FIN_WAIT_2 state.  When this happens, the connection *never*
	closes and such hung connections accumulate.
Repeat-By:
	If you have frequent TCP connections with a TOPS-20 host,
	you will notice, using netstat, connections in FIN_WAIT_2 state
	accumulating.  If you have frequent TOPS-20 traffic, all your
	incoming network pty ports will eventually be eaten up.
Fix:
	Add the line marked with +, 533, to /sys/netinet/tcp_input.c.
	This kludge does not agree complete with the TCP spec,
	but it does solve the problem.

		/*
		 * In FIN_WAIT_1 STATE in addition to the processing
		 * for the ESTABLISHED state if our FIN is now acknowledged
		 * then enter FIN_WAIT_2.
		 */
		case TCPS_FIN_WAIT_1:
			if (ourfinisacked) {
				/*
				 * If we can't receive any more
				 * data, then closing user can proceed.
				 */
				if (so->so_state & SS_CANTRCVMORE)
					soisdisconnected(so);
				tp->t_state = TCPS_FIN_WAIT_2;
+				tp->t_timer[TCPT_2MSL] = 2 * TCPTV_MSL;
			}
			break;
