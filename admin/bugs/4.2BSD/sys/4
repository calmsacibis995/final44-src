Subject: missing seek on pipe (ESPIPE) error
Index: sys/sys/ufs_syscalls.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	Our local software (as well as commands like `tee') rely on the
	ESPIPE error from lseek() to determine whether data is coming/going
	down a pipe.   When converting to 4.2 this failed and we tracked it
	down to lseek setting an EINVAL rather than ESPIPE error number.
Repeat-By:
	call lseek on a pipe.
Fix:
	change source at  line 371 in ufs_syscalls to

	if(fp == NULL) {
		if(u.u_error == EINVAL) u.u_error = ESPIPE;
		return;
	}
