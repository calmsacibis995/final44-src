Subject: Minor problems with the pcl-11 driver
Index: 	sys/vaxif/if_pcl.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The pcl-11 network driver has some timing problems with
	re-initialization after error conditions.  The driver is not
	truely at fault, the device does not reset quickly enough
	when an INIT is issued after a device error.  The code needs
	juggling for error recovery and there is a small typo
	in setting up the receive control register.
Repeat-By:
	Have some hardware errors.  Eventually the timing problem will
	hit and you will continuously receive/send errors.
Fix:
	The following diff's move the INIT sets around such that there
	is a little time to allow the device to settle before trying
	to set a device register.  Also a fix to a typo in setting
	up for a packet receive.

------ pcl_start() --------
  	 * Have request mapped to UNIBUS for transmission.
  	 * Purge any stale data from this BDP, and start the output.
