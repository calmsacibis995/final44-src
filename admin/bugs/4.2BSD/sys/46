Subject: ip_stripoptions() copies to the wrong buffer
Index: 	sys/netinet/ip_input.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When ip_stripoptions() is called, it copies the stripped ip
	options to the wrong buffer.  Since the buffer is usually
	not looked at, it doesn't matter, but it seems wrong.
Repeat-By:
	Send a packet with options through a machine acting as a gateway.
Fix:
	The following is a diff of ip_stripoptions() with a little context.

  	if (mopt) {
  		mopt->m_len = olen;
  		mopt->m_off = MMINOFF;
+ #ifdef	PUCC
+ 		bcopy((caddr_t)ip, mtod(mopt, caddr_t), (unsigned)olen);
+ #else	PUCC
  		bcopy((caddr_t)ip, mtod(m, caddr_t), (unsigned)olen);
+ #endif	PUCC
	}
