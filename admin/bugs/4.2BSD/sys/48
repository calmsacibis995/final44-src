Subject: ip_output() alters id numbers of forwarded packets
Index: 	sys/netinet/ip_output.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The internet id of packets being forwarded through a gateway
	gets byteswapped.  The id is converted to host order in
	ipintr() but is not reconverted to network order when the
	packet is forwarded out through ip_output().  Fortunately,
	this is very consistant, so it does not cause problems
	with packet fragmentation, but it does appear to be wrong.
Repeat-By:
	Forward packets through a gateway.
Fix:
	The following is a diff of ip_output() with a little context:

	/*
	 * Fill in IP header.
	 */
	ip->ip_hl = hlen >> 2;
	if ((flags & IP_FORWARDING) == 0) {
		ip->ip_v = IPVERSION;
		ip->ip_off &= IP_DF;
		ip->ip_id = htons(ip_id++);
#ifdef	PUCC
	} else {
		ip->ip_id = htons(ip->ip_id);
#endif	PUCC
	}
