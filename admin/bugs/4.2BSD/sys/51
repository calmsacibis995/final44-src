Subject: ubamem() isn't what it should be, & is called wrongly too.

Index: sys 4.2BSD
	sys/vaxuba/uba.c sys/vaxif/if_ec.c 4.2BSD
Description:
	I don't understand why one would want to '|' in the
	map register disable bits in the uba control register,
	they're not "bits" but a number, the code that is currently

		if (i > (cr >> 26))
			uh->uh_uba->uba_cr |= i << 26;

	would be better done as

		if (i > (cr >> 26))
			uh->uh_uba->uba_cr = (i << 26) | (cr & 0xff);

	(maybe even with some names to replace the magic numbers)

	2nd (semi-related) problem, is that if_ec.c (the only thing
	that I can find that calls ubamem()) expects to be able to
	undo the map register disable, by calling ubamem() with
	addr & number of pages both 0.  That's not going to work.
	I'll leave it to you to decide whether to change if_ec.c
	or make ubamem() understand that convention.  (Latter
	is HARD).

Repeat-By:
	Doesn't make sense.

Fix:
	Given above (as much as I know).
