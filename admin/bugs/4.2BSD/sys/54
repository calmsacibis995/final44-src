Subject: TCP retransmission bug
Index:	sys/tcp 4.2BSD

Description:
     Your TCP is retransmitting excessively.  We are getting each packet
 about three times!  The connection summaries below (from our special 
 diagnostic TCP implementation) indicate that the upper limit for 
 retransmission time interval is too low, or the calculation of round-trip
 time at your end is calculating values that are too low.  Please check
 and advise.  We are getting unreasonably poor performance in talking to
 several 4.2BSD sites.  We will cooperate in testing and will provide
 a detailed packet trace if desired.

 The first summary represents a file transfer data connection from FORD-WDL1
 to UCB-VAX; a 10000 byte file was sent.  Everything worked fine.  There
 is one duplicate ACK; this is acceptable.  Round-trip time stayed under
 3 seconds.  This direction works OK; trouble is in the other direction.

      Here is trouble.  The same 10000 byte file was transferred back to
 FORD-WDL1 from UCB-VAX.  It worked, but througput was terrible.  There
 were 23 useful messages and 81 duplicates!  This is way out of line.
