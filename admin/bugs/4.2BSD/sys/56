Subject: tu58 tape driver can cause panic
Index:	sys/vax/tu.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	In sys/vax/tu.c (the console tu58 driver), the tu_restart
	function calls "timeout" with a bad argument.  This
	can cause the system to crash if a tu_restart ever occurs
	(as often happens on a 750).
Repeat-By:
	cp /dev/tu0 /dev/null
	will crash a 750; it would probably crash a 730 too
	if the tu_restart code ever gets called.
Fix:
	The bad line says:
		timeout(tustart(), (caddr_t)0, hz * 3);
	and should read
		timeout(tustart, (caddr_t)0, hz * 3);

	Alas however, there still seems to be bugs in the 750 (RSP)
	version of the code.  I have my config file and makefile
	set up properly to include the pseudo-dma code, but
	it still doesnt work (manual section tu(4) claims it
	should work in single user mode).  I get many "overrun
	error, transfer restarted" messages.  As a long shot
	I tryed nooping the call to "tudma" in locore (Xconsdin),
	but still no go.  I was hoping to use the tu58 to
	backup the dist cassette and in getting some initial
	conversion sources over until my net interface
	is working (with Stanford subnets).
