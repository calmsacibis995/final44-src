Subject: /etc/route can't setup host specific route

Index:	sys/netinet/ip_output.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	If you setup a manual route to a specific host,
	ip_output will fail to use it.

Repeat-By:
	For example:
		/etc/route add diablo 36.45.0.73
	Sets up a correct routing table entry to send packets
	for host "diablo" to gateway 36.45.0.73.  However
	attempting to connect to diablo will now fail because
	the IP is not being sent to the gateway.

Fix:
	In "ip_output", change the line
		if (ro->ro_rt->rt_flags & RTF_GATEWAY)
	to read
		if (ro->ro_rt->rt_flags & (RTF_GATEWAY|RTF_HOST))

	We only used the "route to host" feature
	for a few days until we get our proper subnet
	routing algorithm into the network drivers, so
	it's not very critical.  But you do advertise
	this feature in "route(8)".
