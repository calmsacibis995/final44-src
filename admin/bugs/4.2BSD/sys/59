Subject: "munhash" and "memall mfind" panics
Index:	sys/vax/vm_machdep.c, 4.2BSD

Description:
	On 4.1c and 4.2 for the VAX (and probably earlier systems),
	attempting to use dbx to run a code file with text space disk
	blocks with block addresses larger than 2^19 will cause a
	"munhash" panic.

Repeat-By:
	On a file system with more than 524287 hardware disk blocks,
	somehow create a code file with text block addresses larger
	than 524287.  Use dbx (or another debugger which inserts check
	points to track program execution) to run the code file.  The
	system will perform a "munhash" panic.

Fix:
	In both sys/vax/vm_machdep.c and sys/sys/vm_mem.c there are
	references to the cblkno bit field of a page table entry which
	look like
	    (daddr_t)(u_long)c->c_blkno

	Despite the fairly obvious intention of the coder to inhibit
	sign extension of the field, the released c compiler uses an
	extv instruction to do the work.  If the 20th bit of c_blkno is
	set, this instruction causes a negative number to be generated
	and used in the expression.

	Although a proper solution probably involves a change to the c
	compiler, the expedient of removing the (daddr_t) cast corrects
	the problem by by causing the compiler to produce the intended
	extzv instruction.  Of course, this change makes lint unhappy
	with the affected code.

	A context diff of the two areas follows:
