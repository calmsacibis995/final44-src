Subject: bug with bad rusage in wait3
Index: 	sys/sys/kern_exit.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	wait() does not check for a zero rusage pointer, and does not
	propagate an EFAULT error that might occur in copying the
	rusage out.
Repeat-By:
	Try using an illegal rusage pointer and checking for EFAULT,
	or try having writable text and using a NULL rusage.
Fix:
	In wait(), the code
		(void) copyout((caddr_t)&ru, (caddr_t)rup, sizeof (struct rusage));
	should be changed to
		if (rup)
			u.u_error = copyout((caddr_t)&ru, (caddr_t)rup, sizeof (struct rusage));
