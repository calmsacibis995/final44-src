Subject: on VAX 750: "soft ecc" is printed for uncorrectible memory error

Index:	sys/vax/machdep.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	In memerr() in /sys/vax/machdep.c  no test is ever done to check
	whether memory errors on a VAX 750 are correctible or not.  Thus
	strange panics and such may occur with no indication on the console
	that there was a hard error.
	  The fix below fixes the problem for a VAX 750.  I suspect that the
	same problem is also present in the VAX 780 and 730 support code, as
	I have not seen any tests for the uncorrectable memory error condition.

	This bug was also present in 4.1.

Repeat-By:
	Get yourself a bad memory board with hard errors.  The system may do
	all sorts of strange things because of memory errors yet only
	"soft ecc" messages will appear on the console. 

Fix:
	Here are the diffs to /sys/vax/machdep.c.  The line numbers of the new
	machdep.c may vary as there have been other fixes necessary.

	This is a 2nd posting.  The M750_SYN(&mcr)) was replaced by
	M750_SYN(&amcr)) in the 4th line form the end.
