Subject: Fix for booting off of Eagles
Index: sys/stand/hp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Up to now we have not been able to boot directly off of an
	Eagle drive using the standalone 'boot' from the console
	floppy. Boot returns the diagnostic 'not a directory'.
	The fix below reveals that the problem appears when an
	Eagle (or other non-DEC drive which must be identified by
	the HPSN register) resides on mba1, mba2, or mba3.

Repeat-By:
	B ANY
	boot: hp(24,0)vmunix   (our Eagles reside on TR11)

Fix:
	In /sys/stand/hp.c, replace
		hp_type[unit] = hpmaptype(hpaddr, i, unit);
	with
		hp_type[unit] = hpmaptype(hpaddr, i, UNITTODRIVE(unit));
	That is, hpmaptype() expects the massbus unit number (0-7).
