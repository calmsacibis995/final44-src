Subject: block number sign extension
Index: 	sys/sys/vm_mem.c 4.2BSD
Index: 	sys/vax/vm_machdep.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	On large partitions (> 2^19 blocks), the block number gets
	sign extended, causing panic: munhash.  The Berkeley code
	should work, but there appears to be a bug in the C compiler.
Repeat-By:
	Try to use lots of a large partition.
Fix:
	In /sys/sys/vm_mem.c in memall() the code
		swapdev : mount[c->c_mdev].m_dev, (daddr_t)(u_long)c->c_blkno
	should be changed to
		swapdev : mount[c->c_mdev].m_dev, c->c_blkno
	and in /sys/vax/vm_machdep.c in chgprot() the code
		munhash(mount[c->c_mdev].m_dev, (daddr_t)(u_long)c->c_blkno);
	should be changed to
		munhash(mount[c->c_mdev].m_dev, c->c_blkno);
	because the C compiler apparently incorrectly folds the (daddr_t) and
	(u_long) together and sign extends anyway.  Simply taking out the
	(daddr_t)(u_long) works, although lint will probably complain about it.
