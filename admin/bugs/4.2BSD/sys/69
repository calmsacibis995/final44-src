Subject: Magic number with UPAGES=8
Index: 	sys/vax/locore.s 4.2BSD

Description:
	There is a magic number (0x3ffff8) representing USRSTACK/NBPG built in
	to Fastreclaim in /sys/vax/locore.s.  However, USRSTACK depends on
	UPAGES, so this magic number has UPAGES=8 built in, which is bogus.
	If you change UPAGES, your system will panic: trap.
Repeat-By:
	Change UPAGES to some other value and regen the system.
Fix:
	Change
		subl3	P_SSIZE(r5),$0x3ffff8,r0
	to
		subl3	P_SSIZE(r5),$(0x400000-UPAGES),r0
	and change
		subl2	$(0x3ffff8+UPAGES),r4
	to
		subl2	$0x400000,r4
