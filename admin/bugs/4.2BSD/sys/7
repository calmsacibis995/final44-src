Subject: dmf-32 driver will not compile with DMFDMA option set
Index: 	sys/vaxuba/dmf.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When dmf.c is compiled with "-DDMFDMA" flag, there are two undefined
	variables found in line 550: "car" and "dmf".  Line 550, and the
	sccs id line appear below:

/*	dmf.c	6.1	83/07/29	*/

		car = UBACVT(tp->t_outq.c_cf, dmfinfo[dmf]->ui_ubanum);

Repeat-By:
	See above.
Fix:
	I think the following two lines added after line 547 ("#ifdef DMFDMA")
	will fix this problem.  Please tell me whether it is correct, as I
	have not tried to run a system with this included yet.

		u_short	car;
		int	dmf = minor(tp->t_dev) >> 3;
