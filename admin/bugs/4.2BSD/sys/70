Subject: TCP bug
Index: 	sys/netinet/tcp_input.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	I just noticed this looking through the code.  Don't know
	how it would manifest itself.
Repeat-By:
	Beats me.
Fix:
	In tcp_intput(), the code
		sbdrop(&so->so_snd, so->so_snd.sb_cc);
		tp->snd_wnd -= so->so_snd.sb_cc;
	should be
		tp->snd_wnd -= so->so_snd.sb_cc;
		sbdrop(&so->so_snd, so->so_snd.sb_cc);
