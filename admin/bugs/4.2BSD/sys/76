Subject: FTRUNC bypasses permissions!
Index:	sys/ufs_syscalls.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	copen doesn't check permissions if FTRUNC is specified but FWRITE
	isn't.  This means you can truncate files you don't have perms on,
	and truncate to zero length DIRECTORIES!!!!
Repeat-By:
	#include <sys/file.h>
	main()
	{
		open("xyz", O_TRUNC|O_RDONLY);	/* xyz with no write perms */
		open(".", O_TRUNC|O_RDONLY);	/* Directory is truncated! */
	}
Fix:
	in copen, change
		if((mode&FCREAT) == 0) {
			if (mode&FREAD)
				...
			if (mode&FWRITE) {
				...
			}
		}
	change the 
			if (mode&FWRITE) {
	to
			if (mode&(FWRITE|FTRUNC)) {
	this will mean the check for write perms will be done for truncate,
	and also the check for being a directory.

*If anybody takes advantage of this on any system on campus before I get
*around to changing them all and after I post this note you will find your
*account gone very quickly!
