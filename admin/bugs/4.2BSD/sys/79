Subject: host vs. net redirects not distinguished
Index: 	sys/net/route.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	ICMP host-specific redirects are treated the same as network redirects.
Repeat-By:
	Go through a gateway that uses ICMP_REDIRECT_HOST and then do a
	netstat -r.
Fix:
	In /sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c, in icmp_input(), change
		rtredirect((struct sockaddr *)&icmpsrc,
		  (struct sockaddr *)&icmpdst);
	to be
		rtredirect((struct sockaddr *)&icmpsrc,
			   (struct sockaddr *)&icmpdst,
			   (((code == ICMP_REDIRECT_NET) ||
			     (code == ICMP_REDIRECT_TOSNET)) ?
			   RTF_GATEWAY : (RTF_GATEWAY|RTF_HOST)));

	In /sys/net/route.c, in rtredirect(), change
		rtredirect(dst, gateway)
			struct sockaddr *dst, *gateway;
	to be
		rtredirect(dst, gateway, flags)
			struct sockaddr *dst, *gateway;
			int flags;
	and change
		/*
		 * Don't listen to the redirect if it's
		 * for a route to an interface. 
		 */
		if (rt->rt_flags & RTF_GATEWAY) {
			/*
			 * Smash the current notion of the gateway to
			 * this destination.  This is probably not right,
			 * as it's conceivable a flurry of redirects could
			 * cause the gateway value to fluctuate wildly during
			 * dynamic routing reconfiguration.
			 */
			rt->rt_gateway = *gateway;
			rtfree(rt);
			rtstat.rts_newgateway++;
			return;
		}
	to be
		if ((rt->rt_flags & (RTF_HOST|RTF_GATEWAY)) != flags) {
			rtfree(rt);
			if (flags & RTF_HOST) {
				rtinit(dst, gateway, flags);
				rtstat.rts_newgateway++;
			}
			return;
		}
		/*
		 * Smash the current notion of the gateway to
		 * this destination.  This is probably not right,
		 * as it's conceivable a flurry of redirects could
		 * cause the gateway value to fluctuate wildly during
		 * dynamic routing reconfiguration.
		 */
		rt->rt_gateway = *gateway;
		rtfree(rt);
		rtstat.rts_newgateway++;
