Subject: DZ code and 3Com ethernet interface can cause timing problems

Index:	sys/tty.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	3Com interfaces interrupt at IPL 16 while DZ's come in at 15.
	The DZ code assumes that spl5 (IPL 15) is good enough to hold
	off any pending interrupts.
Repeat-By:
	Combination of moderate dz and ethernet activity will cause
	random panics.
Fix:
	Replace all spl5 to spl6 in above mentioned modules.  Actually
	spl6 (IPL 18) is a little over kill but there is no other good 
	pre-defined level unless you edit asm.sed.
