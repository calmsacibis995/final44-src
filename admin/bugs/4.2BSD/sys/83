Subject: vv doesn't broadcast, doesn't loopback
Index: sys/vaxif/if_vv.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The V2LNI driver doesn't set up for broadcast correctly, and
	doesn't take advantage of the loopback-net.
Repeat-By:
	Try running rwhod (for broacast) and rlogin to self (for loopback).
Fix:
	Somewhere after the top add the declaration
		extern struct ifnet loif;
	In vvinit(), change
		sin->sin_addr = if_makeaddr(vs->vs_if.if_net, VV_BROADCAST);
	to be
		sin->sin_addr = if_makeaddr(vs->vs_if.if_net, 0);
	and change
		vs->vs_if.if_flags |= IFF_UP | IFF_RUNNING;
	to be
		vs->vs_if.if_flags |= IFF_UP | IFF_RUNNING | IFF_BROADCAST;
	In vvoutput(), after
		dest = ((struct sockaddr_in *)dst)->sin_addr.s_addr;
	add
		if ((dest == ((struct sockaddr_in *)&ifp->if_addr)->sin_addr.s_addr) &&
		   ((loif.if_flags & IFF_UP) != 0))
			return(looutput(&loif, m0, dst));
	(note the check to make sure the loopback is up, which other drivers
	don't do but should) and after
		if ((dest = in_lnaof(*((struct in_addr *)&dest))) >= 0x100) {
			error = EPERM;
			goto bad;
		}
	add
		if (dest == 0)
			dest = VV_BROADCAST;
