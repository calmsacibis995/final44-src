Subject: Bug in rip_output()
Index: sys/netinet/raw_ip.c 4.2BSD

Description:
          When performing raw internet output, the ip_off field in the
          internet header is never completely cleared.  Although the
          ip_output routine later zeroes everything but the IP_DF flag,
          this flag may still be randomly set (depending on the previous
          contents of the mbuf used to hold the ip header).  As a result,
          raw output packets larger than the maximum local net packet size
          may be rejected as "too large".
Repeat-By:
          Try repeatedly sending packets larger than the maximum local net
          packet size using the raw interface.  Some will be rejected as
          too large.
Fix:
          Add the following line to the rip_output() routine in the file
          /sys/netinet/raw_ip.c:

          ip = mtod(m, struct ip *);
/* add the following line */
          ip->ip_off = 0;
/* end of addition */
          ip->ip_p = so->so_proto->pr_protocol;
