Subject: icmp_input() doesn't pullup
Index: 	sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	icmp_input() assumes that both the IP and ICMP headers are
	in the first mbuf, which they needn't be.
Repeat-By:
	Well, first you should give superuser access to raw ICMP.
	All the code is there, but the protosw doesn't give access,
	so change the ICMP protosw in in_proto.c to
		{ SOCK_RAW,	PF_INET,	IPPROTO_ICMP,	PR_ATOMIC|PR_ADDR,
		  icmp_input,	rip_output,	0,		0,
		  raw_usrreq,
		  0,		0,		0,		0,
		},
	Then write yourself a "ping" program to send ICMP ECHOs and look for
	ICMP ECHOREPLYs.  Watch it work over a real network.  Watch it
	fail over the loopback-net to yourself, with ECHO packets apparently
	being zeroed out.
Fix:
	In icmp_input(), add the code
		if ((m->m_off > MMAXOFF || m->m_len < (sizeof (struct icmp) + hlen)) &&
		    (m = m_pullup(m, (sizeof(struct icmp) + hlen))) == 0) {
			icmpstat.icps_tooshort++;
			return;
		}
		ip = mtod(m, struct ip *);
	before the lines
		m->m_len -= hlen;
		m->m_off += hlen;
	and remove the comment
		/* need routine to make sure header is in this mbuf here */
