Subject: Accounting time quantities screwed up
Index: sys/sys/kern_acct.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Accounting records now write times out in seconds, sa still works in
	60ths of seconds.
	Accounting entry ac_mem is incorrect as the kernel divides by
	SECONDS, the integrated memory usage which is in NBPG ticks.
Repeat-By:
	Use sa -u to see what's being printed out, its wrong.
Fix:
	I can't provide the fix to sa because we have so many changes in it
	to make it work on uid/gid basis that a diff listing would be horrible.
	However, basically, everywhere that uses a time currently divides by
	60 to get rid of the old hz factor. e.g. routine col() divides by either
	60 or 3600 depending on whether it wants seconds or minutes when it
	should be just divide by 60 for minutes.
