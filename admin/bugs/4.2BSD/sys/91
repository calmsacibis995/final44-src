Index:	sys 4.2BSD

Description:
	There seems to be a problem where the dialup modems refuse to hang up
	when the connection is abnormally terminated.
	
	The power to my modem failed while I was dialed-into dali.  I made a
	phone call and then redialed dali.  Surprise!
	
	I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOG IN--MY SHELL WAS STILL THERE, PROMPTING ME FOR THE
	NEXT COMMAND.

Repeat-By:
	Obvious from the above.  I don't know if it is easily repeatable.
