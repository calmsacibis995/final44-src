Subject: 4.2 raw_usrreq() reuses freed route
Index: sys/net/raw_usrreq.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When raw_usrreq() frees a route in the process of sending a packet,
	it doesn't zero the pointer to the route.  This results in freeing
	the route multiple times, and in using that route for the duration,
	as all subsequent rtalloc's become no-ops (see the /* XXX */ comment
	in rtalloc).
Repeat-By:
	Use one socket to send raw packets that need different routes;
	many packets won't go where they are supposed to go.
Fix:
	In raw_usrreq(), under case PRU_SEND, change
		if (rp->rcb_route.ro_rt)
			rtfree(rp->rcb_route.ro_rt);
	to
		if (rp->rcb_route.ro_rt) {
			RTFREE(rp->rcb_route.ro_rt);
			rp->rcb_route.ro_rt = NULL;
		}
