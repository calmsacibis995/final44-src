Description:
	System crashes when trying to change protection on a page which
	is > 2^19 (due to a c compiler bug in playing around with casts)
	This occurs when attempting to write to user I space in trace mode.
Repeat-By:
	Try to patch instructions using adb on a running process.
	The process must be on a large file system, with its text pages
	on a block > 2^19.
Fix:
	chgprot,
		munhash(mount[c->c_mdev].m_dev, (daddr_t)(u_long)c->c_blkno);
	the cast of (daddr_t)(u_long) is causing the extzv instruction to
	pull c_blkno out of the cmap structure using a extv; i.e. deciding
	to sign extend.  It works if you just delete the casts; however
	this means you won't pass lint any more.  This is probably a c compiler
	bug.
