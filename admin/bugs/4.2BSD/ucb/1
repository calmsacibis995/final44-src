Subject: sleep 10 && sleep 5 & will create a non-interruptable command
Index: 	ucb/csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	The command `sleep 10 && sleep 5 &' will create a non-interruptable
	non-suspendable pipeline which is not run in background.  I can
	reliably reproduced the problem.  It seems to fail if (any) other
	commands besides sleep are used.
Repeat-By:
	type `sleep 10 && sleep 5 &'
