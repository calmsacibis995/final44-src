Subject: ``at'' command fails
Index: 	ucb/at.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	While ``at'' accepts input and creates the /usr/spool/at/??
	file, execution fails when the file is run.  The file is
	removed.

Repeat-By:
	at 1325 oct 23
	date > ~/attime
	^D
Fix:
	``at'' uses the ``<<'' input re-direction facility of ``csh''
	in the following manner:

	    { cd & assignment of environment variables }
	    /bin/csh << 'xxFUNNYxx'
	    date > ~/attime
	    xxFUNNYxx
	
	The problem seems to be that 'xxFUNNYxx' does not match xxFUNNYxx
	(i.e. without the single quotes).  So, the csh started up never
	executes the enclosed commands.  Perhaps the problem is in ``csh''!

Subject: ``at'' command fails -- correction
Index: 	ucb/at.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Previous description of bug is correct.
Repeat-By:
	Previous procedure holds
Fix:
	My previous ``fix'' is wrong for the following reasons:
	    ``sh'' seems to be the shell, not ``csh''
	    the ``<<'' re-direction used by ``at'' works for ``sh''
	I don't know how to fix the problem.
