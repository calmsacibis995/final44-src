Subject: print doesn't work for big file lists

Index:	ucb/print.sh 4.1c

Description:
	I tried to print out a directory of files, and got the diagnostic
		lpr: cannot create /usr/spool/lpd/df 274cbosgd
	cat -v showed that the "space" in the file name was a meta
	null, e.g. 0200.
Repeat-By:
	The directory in question was the Usenet directory as posted to
	net.news.map on July 1.  The file names in question were:

	aus.nsw		eur.d		usa.fl		usa.mo		usa.ri
	can.ab		eur.dk		usa.ga		usa.ms		usa.sc
	can.bc		eur.f		usa.hi		usa.mt		usa.sd
	can.mb		eur.gb		usa.ia		usa.nc		usa.te
	can.nb		eur.gb.pss	usa.id		usa.nd		usa.tx
	can.nf		eur.nl		usa.il		usa.ne		usa.ut
	can.ns		eur.s		usa.in		usa.nh		usa.va
	can.nt		usa.ak		usa.ka		usa.nj		usa.vt
	can.on		usa.al		usa.ky		usa.nm		usa.wa
	can.pe		usa.ar		usa.la		usa.nv		usa.wi
	can.pq		usa.az		usa.ma		usa.ny		usa.wv
	can.sk		usa.ca		usa.md		usa.oh		usa.wy
	can.yt		usa.co		usa.me		usa.ok
	eur.b		usa.ct		usa.mi		usa.or
	eur.ch		usa.de		usa.mn		usa.pa

	The command that caused the problem was
		print *
	Also, typing
		print * |& cat -v
	was enlightening.
	The command
		pr -f * | lpr
	worked, producing about a file of about 150K bytes.  Just printing
	one file:
		print aus*
	worked fine.  /usr/ucb/lpr is suid root, /usr/spool/lpd is 755 owned
	by root (as distributed).  Presumably it's the meta-null that the
	kernel doesn't like.  There was a hefty pause between issuing the
	command and getting the diagnostic, of about 10 seconds, as if it
	were reading all the files.
