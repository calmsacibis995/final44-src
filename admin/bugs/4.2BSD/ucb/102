Subject: Bug in tset(1)
Index:  ucb/tset/tset.c 4.2 Fix

Description:
	tset(1) does not initialize tabs correctly on terminals with
	settable tab stops.  Specifically, it does not set a tab at
	column 0, so that a tab given from column 72 on a terminal with
	auto wrap will incorrectly tab to column 8 on the next line,
	instead of column 0.
Repeat-By:
	Take a terminal with settable tab stops and auto wrap and issue
	the tset(1) command.  Put the terminal in local mode and keep
	hitting the tab key; notice that after column 72 the next tab
	stop is at column 8.
