Subject: problems with more on ucbarpa
Index:	ucb/more.c 4.2

Description:
	The more command doesn't work for me on ucbarpa at all.
Repeat-By:
	I logged in, as mark, on ucbarpa today, and the more command
	wasn't working.  My terminal type was c100-rv, but changing
	it to "dumb" didn't seem to make any difference.  Neither did
	unsetenv'ing TERMCAP.

	When I typed, say
		more /etc/passwd
	it just sat there, until I hit ^C.  (DEL didn't work because
	you seem to have changed the default from DEL to ^C.  I suppose
	I'll be warned about this when I read the documentation that
	comes with 4.2.)  It hadn't gone into cbreak/noecho mode yet.
	I did a ^\ to get a core, and it appeared to be in
		read(0, 7120, 400);
	(I'm not sure because /usr/ucb/more is stripped and /usr/src
	is protected.)  This core file is still in my directory.

	When I typed, say
		more < /etc/passwd
	it behaved like "cat" - it didn't stop after a page.
