Subject: dbx doesn't mark files as busy
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.1c

Description:
	When an executable file (say a.out) is being debugged by
	"dbx a.out", and the dbx job is pushed into the background
	with ^Z, an attempt to execute a.out succeeds.  Unfortunately
	bizarre results can follow.  I suspect that an attempt to
	execute a.out should result in the message "Text file busy."
	as happens in 4.1.
Repeat-By:
	I assume that dbx is supposed to mark executables as busy.
	If not, I have examples that behave wrongly when executed
	while a dbx job is stopped.
