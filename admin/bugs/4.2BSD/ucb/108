Subject: dbx doesn't understand block local variables
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.1c

Description:
	Dbx doesn't seem to have knowledge of variables declared local
	to a block (that is declared after a '{' in the middle of a 
	function).  The print command refuses to print their values.
	Further, the "machine level commands" won't give out the address
	of local variables.
Repeat-By:
	main () {
	    int     i,
	            j;
	
	    i = j = 5;
	    {
	        int     k;
	
(*)	        k = i;
	    }
	}

Put a breakpoint at (*).  Then when execution reaches that point, try
"print k".  Dbx will respond "k" is not active. "&k/" will respond
with "k is not currently defined".
