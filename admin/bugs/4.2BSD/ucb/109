Subject: dbx can't set values of double precision variables
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.1c

Description:
	Dbx can't set the value of variables declared double.
Repeat-By:
	In
		main(){double i; i = 3.0;}
	if a breakpoint is set and then the command
	"set i=3.0" is given, the error message "incompatible types"
	is returned.  "set i=3" works, but then "print i" returns
	gibberish, as expected.
