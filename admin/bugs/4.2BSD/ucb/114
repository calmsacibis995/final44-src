Subject: response to DEL over rlogin

Index:	ucb/rlogin.c 4.2

Description:
	When dialed up at 1200 baud into cbosgd (a 750 running 4.2)
	and rlogin-ing to pavo (a Sun 120 running 1.1), most of the
	time response to DEL to flush a printout is excellent.  It
	flushes right away.  However, sometimes the response is not
	very good.
Repeat-By:
	Dial up one machine at 1200 baud.  Rlogin to another machine
	over the Ethernet.  Cat any fairly large file, like /etc/termcap.
	Wait for 40-50 lines to go by, then hit DEL.  Another 40-50 lines
	will go by before you get any response.  You can pound on DEL
	all you want, and it won't speed up the response.
Fix:
	I don't have one, but I can make the observation that 40-50
	lines is about 8K bytes, e.g. one block, and that no doubt
	what is happening is that some buffer somewhere is immune to
	being flushed when you hit DEL.
