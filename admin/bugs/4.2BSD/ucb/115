Subject: Re: vi bug (4.2bsd)
Index:	ucb/ex/*.c 4.2 Fix

Description:
	Vi (ex in visual mode) does not reinitialize the screen
	correctly when a stopped editing session is brought back into
	the foreground, IF the cursor happens to have been on the
	'wrapped-around' portion of a line which exceeds the width of
	the screen when the job was stopped.  Vi leaves the screen
	completely blank, and just puts the cursor in the right place!

Repeat-By:
	Edit any file.  Generate a long line, which must be 'wrapped' onto
	more than one line on the screen.

	Normal:  Put the cursor on any character of the early part of the line.
	Stop the job with control-Z.  Bring the job back into the foreground
	with 'fg'.  Note that everything is as it should be.

	Bug:  Put the cursor on any portion of the 'wrapped' part of the
	long line.  Stop the job with control-Z.  Bring the job back into the
	foreground with 'fg'.  Note that the screen is blank, and that the
	cursor is out in the middle of nowhere.  Press the escape key.  Note
	that the screen is now properly refreshed, and that the cursor is
	where it should be.

	It turns out that pressing any key gets things to show up on
	the screen again, so it's not a serious problem, but naive
	users will be non-plussed by this behavior, should they happen
	to stumble into it.

Fix:	Have the program note when the cursor is on a 'wrapped' portion of
	a long line, and have it refresh the screen when it discovers
	it is being revived after being stopped in that state.  The code
	should catch SIGCONT.



Thank you.
