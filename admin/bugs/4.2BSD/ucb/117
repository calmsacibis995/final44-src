Subject: rexec/rcmd/rsh daemon problems 
Index: ucb/in.rexecd.c 4.2

Description:
	The daemons do not operate quite as documented.

	The "rexec" daemon expects the password in the clear, not encrypted.
	
	The "rexec" daemon does not actually open the error connection 
	until after step 7, as given on the manual page, instead of
	in step 2.  If any error occurs, the error connection is NEVER
	opened.  This probably also applies to ``rsh''. 

	The remote execution daemon outputs a one byte code (0 or 1)
	to indicate success or failure; a value of 1 is followed by an
	error message.  The manual page for ``rexecd'' says that the
	``null byte is returned on the connection associated with the
	stderr'', but it is actually returned on the connection associated
	with the stdout. 

	The supplied ``rexec'' routine does not properly communicate with
	the supplied daemon, but which of the above is the problem is not
	yet known.  The ``rcmd/rsh'' machinery appears to work, because 
	both routines are compatible although inconsistent with the 
	documentation.

Repeat-By:

	Examine the source code to validate the above problems.

	Write a small program to exercise the ``rexec'' machinery,
	using the error stream facility.
