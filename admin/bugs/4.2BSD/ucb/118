Subject: Ex ignores scripts if termcap entry not found
Index:	ucb/ex 4.2

Description:
	If the termcap entry isn't found, and stdin is a disk file, ex
	doesn't execute any of the commands in the script but returns
	success (0) anyway.  This botches compiles of profiling kernels.
Repeat-By:
	$ echo "hello" >foo
	$ echo '1,$p
	q' >bar 			# A simple editting script
	$ ex - foo <bar
	hello				# This is as expected.
	$ TERMCAP=/dev/null		# A termcap lacking "dumb"
	$ export TERMCAP
	$ cat bar | ex - foo
	dumb: Unknown terminal type	# A needless complaint,
	hello				# but at least it worked.
	$ ex - foo <bar 		# But from a disk file,
	dumb: Unknown terminal type	# we only get the complaint
	$ echo $?
	0				# and it claims success
