Description:
	Vi version 3.7 sometimes has trouble switching between normal
	and inverse video messages.

Repeat-By:
	Enter vi while using a terminal that has inverse video. Append
	some lines until there are 10 in the buffer. Go to home and type
	"dL". Vi wipes out the lines in the buffer, displays the message
	"10 lines deleted" and then overwrites this message with the
	(inverse video) message "No lines in the file". Then type '"1p"
	(to retrieve the lines from the first delete register) and observe
	the message "10 lines". The "10" part comes out normal, but " lines"
	is still in inverse video.
