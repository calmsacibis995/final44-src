Subject: Fix for tset getting type from environment

Index:	ucb/tset/tset.c 4.2BSD Fix
Description:
	rlogin nicely propogates the terminal type in the environment,
	but tset doesn't use it if mapping is specified.
	Such mapping if often necessary because users sometimes log in
	via telnet and not rlogin, for various reasons (such as they're
	coming from a non-Unix host.)
Repeat-By:
	rlogin to another host and have your .login on that host
	contain a tset something like:
	set noglob; eval `tset -Q -s -m -m network:?t10`; set glob
	It will query you even tho it knows better.
Fix:
	Fix by using any existing type from environment as starting point
	even if mapping is specified.  (Dunno why that test on "Mapping"
	was there.  Looks like a logic bug to me.)  This fix applies to 4.1x
	tset also.
