Subject: vi: restore in wrap mode
Index: ucb/ex 4.2 (Pyramid osx2.3)

Description:
	When wrap mode is set in vi and characters are added to a line
using either the "." (repeat last substitution) or "p" (insert hold
buffer) commands, resulting in a line extending past the wrap margin,
the result is scrambled and "u" (undo) does not restore the buffer.

Repeat-By:

	Enter vi on this message, go to this line (on an 80 char
tty) and type:
:set wm=12
0y$$p
