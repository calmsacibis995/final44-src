Index:	ucb/lpr 4.2 Fix

Description:
	The lpd daemon will not talk to a remote daemon unless the remote
	daemon is on a reserved socket.  This means that the remote lpd
	has to be either suid root, or else the remote TCP can't support
	the Berkeley notion that being on a reserved port implies that
	you are the super user.

	I don't see what extra security you gain by requiring the reserved
	port.  It does cause problems when trying to bring up a program to
	speak the Berkeley printer protocols on System V.
Repeat-By:
	Try to bring up a program that runs suid lp (not root) and
	sends files to print over the net to a Berkeley machine.
Fix:
	In lpd.c, routine chkhost, the second and third lines check
	that it's an INET address and in the  IPPORT_RESERVED range.
	Since the family must be INET, the easiest fix is probably
	to remove these two lines.

	In the meantime, I have to program around it by having my
	daemon specifically ask for a reserved socket.  Fortunately,
	this can be done since I'm running UNET.  However, this
	defeats your security mechanism completely (which isn't very
	secure anyway.)
