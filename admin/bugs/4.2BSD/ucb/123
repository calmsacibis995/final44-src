Subject: 4.2bsd ftp miscalculates transfer rate of large files +FIX
Index: ucb/ftp/ftp.c  4.2  Fix

Description:	Ftp's report of the average transfer rate
		is incorrect for large files.
Repeat-By:	Using ftp, transfer a file between 300 and 500 Kbytes.
		The reported transfer rate is negative - clearly wrong.
Fix:
Part of the calculation is being done in a 32-bit long, which
overflows for files longer than 268435 bytes.  The calculation
needs to be done in floating point.  (Line numbers may vary).

diff ftp.old.c ftp.c
565c565
<	bs = ((bytes * NBBY * 1000) / (float) nz(ms)) / NBBY;
---
>	bs = bytes * 1000.0 / nz(ms);
