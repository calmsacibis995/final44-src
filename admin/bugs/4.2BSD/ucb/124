Subject: bug in vgrind
Index:	ucb/vgrind 4.2

Description:
	The character sequence (* causes vgrind to think a comment
	has started.  This might be true in Pascal, but is wrong in C.
	Unfortunately, (* is fairly common in C programs.  (I assume
	that this is just a symptom of a larger problem, that vgrind
	doesn't consider what language it's in when deciding what is
	a comment.)
Repeat-By:
	Vgrind a program containing something like this:
		/* comment */
		if (*p)
			printf("Yes\n");
		/* comment */
		printf("No\n");
		(*func)(arg1, arg2);
		printf("Maybe\n");
		/* comment */
	The text beginning right after the (* is in italics, all the
	way to the next comment.
Fix:
	While I don't have a fix, it shouldn't be hard to have vgrind
	figure out what language it's in (by noting the first type of
	comment, for example, and setting a flag) and only believing
	comments that are in the proper language.  Or it could look
	at the suffix of the file.

	Note that I observed this bug in /usr/lib/vfontedpr 1.1 84/12/21 SMI,
	but I suspect it applies to any 4.2BSD based vgrind.
