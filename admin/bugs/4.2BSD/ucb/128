Subject: 3rd party copies don't work in 4.2 rcp
Index: 	ucb/rcp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	rcp (version 4.8) doesn't work for 3rd party copies.
	In forking rsh it uses -L instead of -l, and uses the wrong
	user name at the destination.

	Even with this fix, I don't think this form of copy has the
	right semantics in terms of who must be equivalent to whom.
	I would have thought that if I could do
		rcp host1.name1:foo /tmp/foo
		rcp /tmp/foo host2.name2:foo
	then I should be able to do
		rcp host1.name1:foo host2.name2:foo
	but that isn't the case.  The current implementation requires
	that name1@host1 (not me) be in the .rhosts of name2@host2.
Repeat-By:
	Try doing one.
Fix:
	Here is a 'diff old new'
