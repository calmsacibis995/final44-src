Subject: 4.2 ftp has 8 character passwords
Index: 	ucb/ftp/getpass.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	User ftp truncates passwords to 8 characters, which loses
	completely when talking to non-Unix sites.
Repeat-By:
	ftp to a TOPS-20, for example, and try to login to an
	account with a long password.
Fix:
	Change
		static char pbuf[9];
	to
		static char pbuf[51];
	and
		if (p < &pbuf[8])
	to
		if (p < &pbuf[50])
	or some other suitably large values.  (Geez, C+Unix=blech.)
