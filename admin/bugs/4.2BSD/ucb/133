Subject: FP won't run under 4.2
Index: 	ucb/fp/fpMain.l 4.2BSD

Description:
	There are two system  calls, in the file 'fpMain.l', that are
	incompatible with some UNIX systems, resulting in core being
	dumped.  The calls are both '(syscall 13)'.
Repeat-By:
	simply run fp and type in any application for evaluation.
	+ : <3 4> will suffice.
Fix:
	The two calls should be changed to '(sys:time)' (no argument).
