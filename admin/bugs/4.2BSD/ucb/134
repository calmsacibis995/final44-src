Subject: 4.1a bug report
Date:	11 Oct 83
From:	support.uci@rand-relay
Subject: abbreviation in "vi"
Index:	ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:

    When one uses a backslash-character sequence to delineate an abbreviated
    word, the "character" will be prepended to the result, rather than appended.

Repeat by:
    :ab sig \(*s         # abreviate \(*s, the troff lower case sigma, as sig 
    i                    # go into insert mode
    sig\d                # insert the abbreviation (sig) deliniated by /d

    This should produce "\(*s\d"; instead it produces "d\(*s\"
