Subject: CTAGS doesn't quote left-square brackets
Index:	ucb/ctags 4.2BSD

Description:
	In creating the regular expression to search for
	CTAGS does not put a  \ in front of any [ that may be in the string.
	This causes the regular expression analyzer to interpret the [ as a
	meta-character.

Repeat-By:
	Run CTAGS on a file with a define in it so that it produces a line 
	like the following:

SIG	../dev/nets.c	/^#define SIG(var,i) net->buf[i].var$/

Fix:
       CTAGS should be fixed to create the line like the following:

SIG	../dev/nets.c	/^#define SIG(var,i) net->buf\[i].var$/
