Subject: fed complaint of SIGSYS errno
Index: 	ucb/fed/fed.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	fed only returns an error message once invoked.
	Apparently, the signal routine as called in fed bombs with
	a SIGSYS errno.  fed aborts even before it can process its
	argument list.
Repeat-By:
	Type in the command with or without an argument.

	% fed <font.file>
	Bad system call (core dumped)
Fix:
	Move the signal(SIGSYS, onsig) from the bottom of the signal
	calls to the top.  This apparently fixed the problem as it
	works for my hp2648.
