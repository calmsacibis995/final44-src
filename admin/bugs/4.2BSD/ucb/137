Subject: lock brain damage on EOT
Index: 	ucb/lock.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	When an ctrl-d (EOT) is typed to the lock program, the
	fgets call returns NULL.  Wherebye the program gets
	into an infinite loop dumping ascii 7's (bells) to stdout.
Repeat-By:
	% lock
	Key:   <type in a key>
	Again: <repeat it>
	Now hit ctrl-d and the fun begins.
Fix:
	The terminal becomes brain damaged due to the handling of 
	EOT in cooked mode.  The fix is simply to put the terminal
	in CBREAK mode.  See enclosed diff.
