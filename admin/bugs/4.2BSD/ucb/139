Subject: bug in ruptime
Index:	ucb/ruptime.c  4.2BSD

Description:
   The actual working directory is misnamed in a diagnostic
   message.  The directory historically was /etc but RWHODIR
   now defines a different place.  Also, the variable "DIR *etc"
   should be renamed since it is misleading.	--Genji
   
   static char sccsid[] = "@(#)ruptime.c	4.14 (Berkeley) 83/07/01";
   DIR	*etc;
   #define	RWHODIR		"/usr/spool/rwho"
   	if (chdir(RWHODIR) < 0) {
   		perror(RWHODIR);
   		exit(1);
   	}
   	etc = opendir(".");
   	if (etc == NULL) {
   		perror("/etc");
   		exit(1);
   	}
