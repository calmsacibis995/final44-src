Subject: Lisp Makefiles cause make clean to break

Index:	ucb/lisp/Makefile 4.2BSD Fix
	also ucb/lisp/franz/Makefile

Description:
	The top-level Makefile fails to pass on flags via the
	${MFLAGS} macro, contrary to convention.  This is the real
	problem; however, this in combination with a both in
	lisp/franz/Makefile cause "make -k clean" to fail:
	that one needs a -f flag to rm on its clean entry.
Repeat-By:
	cd /usr/src/ucb/lisp; make clean (or make -k clean)
Fix:
	Add ${MFLAGS} on every invocation of make on a subdir.
	Add the -f flag.
