Subject: Pi gives error on real reads
Index: 	ucb/pascal/pi 4.2BSD

Description:
	Pix blows up on the second real number read from stdin.
	More precisely, the first real read following the read
	of a real number entered with a decimal point will fail.

Fix:
	Unknown. Pc does not have the same bug, so it
can be used when real reads are needed.
