Subject: User Telnet doesn't do netascii properly
Index: ucb/telnet.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	User Telnet does not properly perform the netascii conversion on
	data being transmitted.  In particular, it sends the carriage
	return character alone without a following newline.  The consensus
	among the Telnet implementers (including Jon Postel) is that
	<CR> should always be followed by <LF>.  The result of this omission
	is that certain hosts drop the first character typed after a <CR>.
Repeat-By:
	Try telnetting to a host whose server Telnet is known to ignore the
	next character sent after a <CR>.
Fix:
	In the routine telnet(), after the lines:

			if (c == IAC)
				*nfrontp++ = c;
			*nfrontp++ = c;

	add the two lines:

			if (c == '\r')
				*nfrontp++ = '\n';
