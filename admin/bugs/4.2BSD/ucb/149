Subject: vi bombs on 100^B
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD
From: Support Group (agent: Richard Johnson) <support@uci-750a>

Description:
	When editing a large file, vi will bomb with "segmentation violation"
	if you move back a large number of pages at a time via the command
	"100^B".  (Note that's 100<Control-B>)
Repeat-By:
	Edit a file that has at least 200 or so lines.  Move to the end
	with the command "G".  Now type "100^B".  You should get
	"segmentation violation (core dumped)".
