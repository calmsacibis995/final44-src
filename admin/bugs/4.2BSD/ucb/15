Subject: make clean fails in sendbug source directory
Index: ucb/sendbug 4.2BSD

Description:
	This, though trivial, is too good to pass up.  Sendbug itself
	caused a bug!  make clean in /usr/src/ucb died when it entered
	the subdirectory `sendbug' because the makefile there did
	not have an entry `clean'.
Repeat-By:
	cd /usr/src/ucb/sendbug ; make clean
Fix:
	add a clean entry to the makefile
