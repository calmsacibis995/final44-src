Subject: File Access Confusion in VI
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
	When I use the ":f" command to change the name of the file I'm editing,
	vi gets confused about the r/w status of the new file.  It remembers
	the status of the old file (which may be read-only) even though the
	status of the new file may be different.

Repeat-By:
	I run vi on a file that is read-only r--r--r--, "% vi protected".
	While in vi I change the name of the file, ":f writeable" and then
	write the file, ":w writeable".  Then I try to write it again,
	":w writeable".  I get an error message saying "File is read-only",
	even though the mode of writeable is rw-r--r--.  Note, this is NOT
	a problem that ":w! writeable" solves.
