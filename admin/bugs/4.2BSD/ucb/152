Subject: dbx confused by external arrays
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a program has a declaration of an array which is external,
	asking dbx to display an element of it fails with the the
	error message "subscript out of range".
Repeat-By:
	tst.c:

	#include "tst.h"
	struct foo  arr[10];
	
	main () {
	    int     i;
	    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
(*)	        arr[i].a = i;
	}

	tst.h:
	
	struct foo {
	    int     a,
	            b;
	};
	
	extern struct foo  arr[];

Run dbx with a breakpoint at the line marked (*), and at the breakpoint do a
"print arr[0]".
