Subject: leave +n doesn't work
Index: ucb/leave.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	when 'leave' is invoked w/ the form 'leave +n', the messages to leave
	are never printed (or at least the last one isn't).
Repeat-By:
	'leave +1'
Fix:
	move the strcp (@ ~ line 46 of the src file) of getlogin into orglogin 
	to the beginning of the main routine.

thanks,
Matthew J. Thurmaier.
