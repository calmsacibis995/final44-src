Subject: telnetd gets confused by \r
Index: ucb/telnetd.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Telnetd has a finite state machine that "remembers" if it should
	treat the next character specially.  If it sees a \r it goes
	into state TS_CR; however, the code for TS_CR treats IAC as
	data, instead of switching to state TS_IAC as it should.
	
	Also, if telnetd sees two \r's in a row, it ends up in TS_DATA
	instead of TS_CR (perhaps not a real problem.)
Repeat-By:
	telnet to your system using a telnet program that can send
	AYTs or IPs or some other command.
	
	login, and type "date" or some other command, followed by
	a return.
	
	try to send AYT; the telnetd will place a "v" in the pty input
	stream instead of responding to the AYT.
	
	Typing two returns after a command will mask this problem.
Fix:
	Replace the existing code in telrcv() at "case TS_CR:" with

		case TS_CR:
			if (c == IAC) {
				state = TS_IAC;
				break;
			}
			if (c && c != '\n')
				*pfrontp++ = c;
			if (!myopts[TELOPT_BINARY] && c == '\r')
				state = TS_CR;
			else
				state = TS_DATA;
			break;
