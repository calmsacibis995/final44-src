Subject: Missing "config.c" in pascal source  4.2
Index:	ucb/pascal/utilities/config.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	On the 4.2 distribution tape (tape was made at UCB on
	Oct 2 1983) the file /usr/src/ucb/pascal/utilities/config.c
	is a symbolic link to ../pi/config.c, but that file does
	not exist.  There is no file config.c anywhere in
	/usr/src/ucb/pascal.
