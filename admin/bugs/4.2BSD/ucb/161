Subject: vi bug
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

vi doesn't realize that deleting all lines in a file changes it.
Try:
	vi existing file
	:1,$d
	ZZ
The file will still exist with its original contents.
The bug also occurs when editing multiple files.  Going
to the next file after deleting all lines of current file
will not cause writing or warning.
Bug exists in vi 3.6 and 3.7.
