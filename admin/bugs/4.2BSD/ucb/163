Subject: tail -f bug
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

If for some reason stdin is not a tty (say you're in a Blit layer or
in script) and you try to tail -f a file, tail thinks it's trying
to tail a pipe and it exits after printing the initial tail.
It should be checking the file actually being tailed, not stdin.
(Since a file name argument can't be a pipe, this means it really
should not set the variable "piped" unless it's tailing stdin.)
