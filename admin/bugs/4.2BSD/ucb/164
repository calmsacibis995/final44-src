Subject: small bug in 'vi' : net.unix-wizards
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

[ ]	The 'vi' editor does not remove a file when all the lines
	have been deleted.  Assume the file 'foo' contains text.
	Issue the following command sequence:
		vi foo
		:1,$d
		ZZ

	If you examine 'foo', you'll discover all of the lines are
	still there.

	However, the following sequence does delete the lines (but
	not the file).
		vi foo
		:1,$d
		:w
		:q


	I have not had the time to find the bug and correct it.
