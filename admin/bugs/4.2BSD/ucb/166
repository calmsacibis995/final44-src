We find the ex  -r option very useful but have one suggestion:
It would be very helpful if ex were to rememeber the DIRECTORY
as well as the file name.  (as it is it is very easy for beginners
to either "lose" the good version in a wrong directory, or worse
to overwrite another file with the same name in the home directory!)
