    Mail's editor escape should trap quits.  It's very disconcerting to
type a quit signal (which my favorite screen editor uses for its own
purposes) and see mail die out from under the editor.  When mail finishes
dumping its core, the parent shell starts reading from the terminal, at
the same time as the editor is reading from the terminal, and it's
impossible to predict which program is going to get my characters.
    In other words, dumping core while the child process is still active
produces a very confusing mess.  It's not a feature, it's a bug.  Please
fix.
