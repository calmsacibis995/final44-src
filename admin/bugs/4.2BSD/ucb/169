Subject: On matchup of TCP connections
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

     I think I understand why others are able to communicate with your FTP
while we are not.  The TCP passive open mechanism is usually used to
allow servers to wait for a connection attempt.  In such cases, the 
``foreign-socket'' is entirely unspecified.  In the FTP case, though,
the ``foreign-socket'' is fully specified, including the ``foreign-port''
in the passive TCP open call.  I suspect that some TCP implementations do
not require a matchup of ``foreign-port'' on passive open operations.
The spec, though, reads ``A passive open may have either a fully specifed
foreign socket to wait for a particular connection or an unspecified foreign
socket to wait for any call.''.  Clearly FTP uses the second case, and thus
TCP should insist on all 4 parameters (foreign port, foreign host, 
local port, and local host) matching exactly before establishing the
connection.
