Subject: No -I option in Pascal.
Index: ucb/pc 4.2BSD

Description: 
	pi,pc, etc. will look for files in #include statements in the current
	directory, unlike cc which has a -I option.
Repeat-By: 
	create two files in a directory dir:
	p.p:	program hi(output);	i.i:	writeln('Hi there')
		begin
		#include "i.i"
		end.
	% pi p.p
	works fine, but 
	% cd ..
	% pi dir/p.p
	doesn't.
