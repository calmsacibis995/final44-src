Subject: vgrind changes date on last page
Index: 	ucb/vgrind/vfontedpr.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When running vgrind with multiple files the last page of the
	current file gets the date from the next file.
Repeat-By:
	Run vgrind with two files that have different modify dates.
Fix:
 It seems vfontedpr is reseting the date before the last .bp, moving the
 .ds past the last .bp seems to fix this. Heres a diff file of the change;

< 	}
< 	if (!filter) {
< 	    printf(".ds =M %s %s\n", cp+4, cp+20);
