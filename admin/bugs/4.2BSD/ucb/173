Subject: dbx doesnt work for fortran
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.2BSD

Description:
	dbx doesnt work for fortran,
	(1) says "procedure not active" when "print"ing from a subroutine
	    (try printing c from junk1 below). actually, it seems to
	    not print any argument passed to the subroutine such as c,r and
	    n in the subroutine below.
	(2) gives adresses rather than variable names in subroutines
	(3) in the 4.1 era when it sort of worked, it printed complex
	    numbers incorrectly as the (imag,real) rather than (real,imag).
	    now, it isnt even capable of printing an array but maybe
	    if it can be fixed the real-imag reversal problem should
	    be fixed too.
	(4) numerous other problems, example: dbx crashed when you
	    dbx "program below"
	    stop at 7
	    run
	    print c
	    Illegal instruction (ie: CRASH)

Repeat-By:
	try program below


	real r(100)
	complex c(100)
	n=100
	do 1 i=1,100
	c(i)=cmplx(float(i),-float(i))
1	r(i)=i
	call junk1(r,c,n)
	a=2
	b=3
	end
	subroutine junk1(r,c,n)
	complex c(n)
	real r(n)
	a=1
	b=2
	d=4
	e=10
	do 1 i=1,n
	c(i)=-c(i)
1	r(i)=e*r(i)
	f=11
	return
	end
