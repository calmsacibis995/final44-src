Subject: minor bug in strings
Index: 	ucb/strings.c 4.2BSD	Fix

Description:
	Strings has a minor bug which causes it to ignore the first 32
	bytes of the data segment when run on and executable file and
	*not* given the '-' flag.

Repeat-By:
	Try 'strings /usr/ucb/strings'.  You'll see output beginning
	with:

	>>>	eley) 3/30/83
		Usage: strings [ -a ] [ -o ] [ -# ] [ file ... ]
		%7D 
		.
		.
		.

	Pretty clearly it is missing something at the very beginning.
Fix:
	The fix is trivial; an fseek incorrectly seeks from the current
	position when it *should* seek from the beginning of the file.
	Contextual diffs follow:

	RCS file: /usr/src/ucb/RCS/strings.c,v

	retrieving revision 1.2
	diff -c -r1.1 -r1.2
