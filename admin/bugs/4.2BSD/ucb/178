Subject: vgrind
Index: ucb/vgrind/vgrind.sh 4.2BSD

Description:
	vgrind.sh writes local files (index,nindex,xindex) via echo
	in the current working directory resulting in 'permission denied'.
Repeat-By:
	Have read permission only in current working directory.
	Execute 'vgrind.sh filename'.
Fix:
	Redirect local files to /tmp/aa$$, /tmp/bb$$, and /tmp/cc$$ in the
	vgrind.sh shell script.

	Please reply.  Thank you.
