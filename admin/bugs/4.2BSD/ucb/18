Subject: Suggestion for pc and pi/px
Index: 	ucb/pascal/utilities/pc.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	I suggest a new predeclared procedure in Pascal, implemented both for
	pc and for pi/px, called 'writeheap'.  It gives a list of all heap objects
	that have been allocated but not deallocated.  It would be nice to list
	with each one the line number of the 'new' that allocated the object.
	It is not necessary to print a reference count or an indication of whether
	the object is reachable.

	This feature is intended for debugging programs that make use of the heap.
	A common error is to forget to deallocate an object.  The programmer would
	call 'writeheap' at the end of the program, and if any heap objects are
	listed, the programmer could find out why the objects were not deallocated
	and take steps to remedy the problem.

Repeat-By:
	This is not a problem.
