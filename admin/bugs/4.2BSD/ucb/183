Subject: more zaps all graphic enhancements.
Index: 	ucb/more 4.2BSD

Description:
	After more displays its prompt in inverse video, it turns
        off ALL enhancements instead of just inverse video.  For
        example, on my Digital Vt220, more sends "ESC[7m" to turn on
        inverse video, and it sends "ESC[m" to turn it off.
        However, this last sequence turns off all enhancements,
        like, for example, emboldening.
Repeat-By:
        more does it everytime.
Fix:
        It should selectively turn off the enhancement which it has
        turned on.  For example, on the VT220, "ESC[27m" would turn
        off inverse video only.
