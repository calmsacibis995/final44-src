Subject: 4.?bsd vi drops @'s into long lines (with fix)
Index: ucb/ex/ex_vadj.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	4.?bsd vi may drop '@' characters into long lines on some terminals.

Repeat-By:
	Hop onto a VT52 (or go into VT52 mode on a terminal capable of doing
	so).  Execute vi.  Ensure that vi's "redraw" option is set.  Enter
	two lines of text, each of which has seventy 'x' characters followed
	by twenty spaces followed by ten 'y' characters.  Position the cursor
	on the first line.  Tap the 'd' key twice to delete the first line,
	then tap the 'u' key to put it back.  Note the '@' character at the
	beginning of the second line of the screen.

Fix:
	The trade secret status of the code precludes a clearer posting.
	Note that this is really a workaround rather than a fix; in some
	cases, installing this workaround may cause '@' characters that mark
	"deleted" lines to not be displayed when they ought to be.
