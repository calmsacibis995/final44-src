Subject: sysline buffer too small.  trashes memory
Index: ucb/sysline/sysline.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	I have written a stdio compatability library which i tested using
	sysline.    My trace vector resides right after the strarr buffer.
	When i have a long path, lots of avt escape characters and several
	users log on/off at once then tracing suddenly turns on.
Repeat-By:
	Use the memory after strarr for something critical and run sysline.
	It really is not worth reproducing.
Fix:
	Increase the size of strarr to avoid overflow
