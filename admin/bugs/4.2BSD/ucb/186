Subject: Where is stable source code and correct man page of netstat
Index: ucb/netstat 4.2BSD

Description:
	We would like to get latest stable source code and a correct
	manual page for /usr/ucb/netstat.  Neither DALI nor MONET
	has these files (or at least not in the standard places).
	We have been told by CSRG that stable source code will be
	found on DALI and that MONET is used for development.  However,
	the code in /usr/src/ucb/netstat on neither machine is in
	in finished state, that is sccs-delta'ed.  Nor does the
	executable file /usr/ucb/netstat match those source files.

	As for man(1) netstat, it tells of a flag (-p protocol) which
	is actually rejected by the command and which is not defined
	in the source code i found.
