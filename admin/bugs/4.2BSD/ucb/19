Subject: script output to screen garbled
Index: ucb/script.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	After configuring in the pty's to our system,  I tested script(1)
	on my VK100 (GIGI) graphics terminal at 9600 baud (sustained rate
	is closer to 3200 baud) and got mostly garbage on my screen.  Later
	cat'ing the typescript file, however, produced the correct text
	and plots.
	I suspected the problem might be the ^S/^Q handshaking was not
	being acknowledged, causing the GIGI's internal buffers to overrun
	and lose characters, so I reran the test at 300 baud. (Have you
	ever waited for a plot to come out at 300 baud?!!)  The output
	to my screen was fine.
	Thus I conclude that script, or more likely the pseudo-terminal
	driver, is not honoring the ^S/^Q handshaking convention.
Repeat-By:
	Running script on a terminal that handshakes.
Fix:
	Actually a patch:  run script at a low baud rate or try inserting
	lots of delay padding into the termcap entry for the terminal
	you're working on.  Only the former really works for graphics
	terminals which can take a very long time to process certain
	graphic escape sequences which termcap (and the tty drivers)
	know nothing about.
