Subject: lpq core dumps after a while when using +#
Index: 	ucb/lpq 4.2BSD

Description:
   If you use lpq +# to continuously print out the queue for a
printer, after a while it seems to break.  After about twenty clears/
redraws, it stops clearing the screen and begins scrolling with a
different message.  After about 5-10 of these different messages,
the program seg faults.

Repeat-By:
	"lpq -Pcx +2" on ucbrenoir.
