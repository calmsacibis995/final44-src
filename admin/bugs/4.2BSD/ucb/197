Subject: indent exits improperly
Index: ucb/indent 4.2BSD

Description:
	indent completes happily but returns a non-zero error status.
	This messes up shell scripts and programs such as make unless
	the user circumvents the bug.
Repeat-By:
	Try using indent in make.
Fix:
	Change line 506 in /usr/src/ucb/indent.c to set a zero exit status.
	All other references to exit() are for abnormal occurences and may
	be changed to return an explicit non-zero exit status.
	This fix was tried and works.
