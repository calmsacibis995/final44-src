Subject: Biff and mesg differ in usage of stdout/stderr.
Index: ucb/biff.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Biff produces its output to stdout, mesg uses stderr.  It's not clear
	which is "correct", but they should be the same.  In a shell script
	I wanted to turn off messages and then restore to the original state
	by doing b=`biff | sed s/is//`; COMMANDS; biff $b, and similarly
	for mesg.  To loose the "is y" and "is n" messages, I redirected
	biff/mesg into /dev/null, and thus discovered the disparity.

Repeat-By:
	Try the following:

	biff; biff > /dev/null; biff >& /dev/null
	mesg; mesg > /dev/null; mesg >& /dev/null

Fix:
	It's so obvious it hardly requires mentioning.  Either change
	the "printf"'s in biff or the "fprintf (stderr"'s in mesg to
	match the other program.
