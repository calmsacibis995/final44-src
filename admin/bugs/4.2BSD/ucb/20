Subject: Talk doesn't work in a mixed machine environment
Index:	ucb/talk 4.2BSD

Description:
	Talk tries to send C structures in datagrams. The layout of these
	structures is machine dependent, and talk fails if, for instance,
	it is used between a VAX and a SUN.

Repeat-By:
	Try it.

Fix:
	The entire scheme used to do the initial synchronisation between
	the talk process and the talk daemon should be thrown away and
	written to use a standard message header plus data which can be
	interpreted according to the information in the header.

	I didn't have time to do that, I just fixed it for the VAX-SUN case,
	and it would probably break on other hardware. But I can send a diff
	if anyone wants it.
