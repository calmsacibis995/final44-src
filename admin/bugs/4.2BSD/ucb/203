Subject: Commands read from file by vi editor
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
	If the character sequence "vi:*:" is contained in a file then "vi"
	tries to execute the command string "*" when the file is read by "vi".
Repeat-By:
	For example, the sequence "vi:p:" in a file will print the line.
	More importantly, the sequence "vi:q:" will cause "vi" to exit
	and thus the file cannot be edited by "vi".

We do not have 4.2BSD sources. Is there any fix in this case?
