Subject: DBX Bug
Index:       ucb 4.2BSD

Description:
	We are having problems with dbx, when a program is run under dbx,
dbx crashes the machine.  I don't know if the problem is with the copy of 
dbx that we have, or there is a bug with the program.  

Repeat-By:
	Try to run or execute a program while in dbx.
