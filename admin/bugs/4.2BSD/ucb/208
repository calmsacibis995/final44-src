Subject: vi bug (4.2bsd)
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

On ucbear, running 4.2 bsd UNIX, vi does not reinitialize the screen correctly
when a stopped editing session is brought back into the foreground,
IF the cursor happens to have been on the 'wrapped-around' portion of a line
which exceeds the width of the screen when the job was stopped.

Vi leaves the screen completely blank, but puts the cursor in the right place!
Pressing any key gets things to show up on the screen again, so it's not
a serious problem, but naive users will be non-plussed by this behavior,
should they happen to stumble into it.

Thank you.
