	Subject: nasty feature of "vi"
	
	When the editor got killed last night owing to my terminal at home
	disconnecting itself, a copy of the buffer was saved.  So far so good.
	Invoking "vi -r file" got the complete thing back, but an immediate "ZZ"
	quit WITHOUT writing the file, at which point I lost it!!!  Naturally any
	further attempts to use the "-r" option failed.  This is a nasty trap to
	fall into.  Can anything be done about it?
