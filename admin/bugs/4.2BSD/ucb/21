Subject: "version" command
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
	If the "version" command is in a .exrc file, the version number
	is printed out twice.  This does not occur if the :version
	command is issued from inside vi.
Repeat-By:
	Add the line "version" to your .exrc file.
	Enter vi.  The version number will be printed out twice.
	(You probably have to unsetenv EXINIT for this to work.)
