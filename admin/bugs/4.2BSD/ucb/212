Subject: bug in vi's abb command
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

I'd like to report a bug in vi.  I should say that we are not
running on a VAX, but on a Pixel 100/AP, using a 4.1 BSD port.

In 'vi', I gave the 'ex' abbreviate command with slashes in it, thus
       :abb misc /misc/magtape/dirs
The first time I tried to type "misc" in my buffer, the cursor printed
"///////////////////miscvi: Segmentation violation -- Core dumped"
and I was thrown out of 'vi' into the shell.  On the other hand, either
":abb mis /misc/magtape/dirs" or ":abb isc /misc/magtape/dirs"
works perfectly.
     While ":abb a /a" causes an error message, "No Tail Recursion",
to be printed in reverse video, 'ex' accepts ":abb a a/".
On my machine, if you then type "a" into your text, the cursor
shuttles back and forth over the "a" until the segmentation violation
message is printed (without the preceding slashes) and you are thrown
out of 'vi' into the shell.  This is all true of question marks (?)
as well as slashes (/).
