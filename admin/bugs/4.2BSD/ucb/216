Subject: vi -- replace or restore in wrap mode
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

	When wrap mode is set in vi and characters are added to a line
using either the "." (repeat last substitution) or "p" (insert hold
buffer) commands, resulting in a line extending past the wrap margin,
the result is scrambled and "u" (undo) does not restore the buffer.
