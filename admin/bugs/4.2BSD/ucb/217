Subject: Recover command on vi does not register as a change
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
        The recover command in vi does not register as a change--
        if vi is exited, the recovered file is not saved
Repeat-By:
        Hang up a file in vi ( system crash or logging out
        with a stopped job in the background )

        recover the job in vi with the :recover or vi -r

        ZZ

        the recovery is not saved and there is no way to get
        the file back -- this is irritating
Fix:
        Register a `:recover` as a change, so vi will save it
        when ZZ is invoked.
