In vi 
:set wm=8 ai
Now delete a long string with, say, `0d$'.  Let the string have n characters.
Now go to the end of a line that is at least 80-n characters long and put the
deleted string with `p'.  An un-undoable mess results.

This is an annoying enough of a bug I am willing to do whatever is
necessary to help someone find it.
