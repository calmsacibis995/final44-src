Subject: mail bug

Index: ucb 4.2BSD
   This is small but intensely annoying when it happens. For some reason, if
you do ~h in the middle of typing a msg the header fields are not supplied in
the same order.  I can see a theoretical reason for this in wanting to get Cc:
and Bcc: together but this is likely to be convenient much less often than one
is inconvenienced by having Subject: before Cc:. (It would have been even
better to put Subject: right after To: in the original set of prompts, but
changing that now is likely to cause even more trouble.
