Subject: Pascal doesn't like mixed-case keywords
Index: 	ucb/pascal/src/hash.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Unless run in "standard" (-s) mode, the Berkeley Pascal
	language processors (pi, pc, pxp) demand lower-case-only
	keywords.  In standard mode, case in the source files is
	ignored.  This leads to a dilemma for people trying to
	compile code written originally for other compilers, since
	if they want to use any extensions, they cannot use standard
	mode.
Repeat-By:
	Try running this program through pi, pc, or pxp (don't use -s):

	PROGRAM Test(output);
	BEGIN
		writeln('hello')
	END.

Fix:
	Since this is, in effect, a change to the Berkeley Pascal
	language, you might want to think twice about installing
	it; someone you know might have been stupid enough to write
	a Pascal program with identifiers that look like keywords,
	except for case.
	
	Otherwise, this fix makes sense: it converts a private
	copy of each token to lower case when looking up keywords.

	Line numbers are for comparison only; your actual line
	numbers may vary.
