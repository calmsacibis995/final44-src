Subject: When cd'ing to parent of symbolic link, pwd pathname and
	 actual path location differ
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

Description:
	I have created a symbolic link named /usr/src/sys/rtingres to
	the directory /usr/ingres/rtingres/files/lock_build.  When I
	am in /usr/src/sys/rtingres and I execute the csh command cd ..,
	I end up in /usr/ingres/rtingres/files.  HOWEVER, the csh command
	pwd says that I am in /usr/src.

	If it is not practical for csh to keep track of the fact that a
	symbolic link has been traversed and go back to the parent
	from which you came, then csh should at least show the
	proper path location.  It is not an acceptable "feature"
	to be in one location, while the csh is saying that you are
	somewhere else.  You can imagine my moment of panic when I
	thought, however briefly, "so long, and thanks for all the
	fish", as well as thinking that I had just destroyed
	/usr/src/sys.
Repeat-By:
	cd'ing to the parent of any symbolic link to a directory.
