As if you didn't already have enough to do ...

    I was recently trying to get vi to bahave properly on a vt100
terminal.  I came to realize that, strictly speaking, the vt100 does not
have a scroll-reverse (:sr=:) capability.  It has a "reverse index",
which only does a reverse scroll if the cursor is at the top of the
screen.  Now, vi version 3.6 will screw up at baudrates slow enough to
reduce the window size (eg. 1200 baud) if :sr=: is defined as the reverse
index.  However, vi version 3.7 will screw up if :sr=: is NOT defined
(assuming :cs=: is defined) [it treats :sr=: properly as a reverse index,
and "assumes" it's there if :cs=: is there too].  Needless to say,
termcap entries for vt100's are somewhat varied.  [Then there's the vt100
:am: bug, but that's another matter].
    In fact, most terminals I've come across have a reverse-index, rather
than a scroll reverse.  Therefore, is there some chance that you might
define a :ri=: (or something similar) for reverse index?  Conceptually,
the two are different capabilities.  Failing that, how about having your
curses treat :sr=: as a reverse index, and change the definition of :sr=:.
    What have others said about this ... I can't believe we're the first
to notice.
