Subject: changing baudrate from within tip doesn't work
Index: ucb/tip 4.2BSD

Description:
	Changing baudrate from within tip doesn't work.

Repeat-By:
	You tip to somewhere on a serial line.
	While in tip, you try to change the baudrate
	using the ~s baudrate=1200 command.
	You will get back the message:
	access denied.

Fix:
	Maybe tip is trying to open the device again in order
	to do the change, but gets a "Mount device busy" [sic]
	error.

	Someone should change that error to just "Device busy".
