Subject: vi -r file
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

Description:
	Could you pass this on to the vi programmers, please:
	vi -r should set the touched switch.
	I just lost 1/2 hour's work by doing ZZ without touching
	the recovered file.  It was thrown away!  I can't say
	I haven't heard a warning about this, but really!
	Thanks, Bob (gmp@ucbrose).
Repeat-By:
	Retrieve a file with vi -r, make changes, do ZZ.
