Subject: last(1): missing fflush and misfeature w.r.t. "reboot"

Index:	ucb/last.c 4.2BSD Fix
Description:
	When remotely executed, last does not print out the response
	to SIGQUIT until something else forces it out.
	(QUIT prints out the "current" date in the wtmp file
	and continues.)

	A misfeature: I think your deletion in the 4.2 release version (changed
	from the prerelease version) of the "net-login-time" for pseudo-
	user "reboot" is a mistake-- that gives useful information,
	(average uptime), as mentioned in the man page.
Repeat-By
	arpa last foo; ^\
Fix:
	Add an fflush(stdout); right after the printf in onintr().
	For "reboot"-- add that code back in again.
