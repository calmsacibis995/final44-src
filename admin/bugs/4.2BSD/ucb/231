Subject: Bug in Vi
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

I run vi on a file that is read-only, "% vi protected".  While in vi I change
the name of the file, ":f writeable" and then write the file, ":w writeable".
Then I try to write it again, ":w writeable".  I get an error message saying
"File is read-only", even though the mode of writeable is rw-r--r--.  Note,
this is NOT a problem that ":w! writeable" will solve.
