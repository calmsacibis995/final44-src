Subject: bugs in vi.
Index: ucb 4.2BSD

Description:
There was a problem with vi.  If a user were in the middle of his file while
doing the editing and gave a command such as "nn^B"; i.e. a string of digits
nn and a control-B(he wanted to go nn pages backward).  Vi just logged him
off the system and gave a segmentation fault(core dumped) message.  This
shouldn't happen this way and vi should ignore this command.
Repeat-By:
	Edit an existing file with vi, move to the next couple of pages,
then enter say "99^B".  Vi will emit the message: Segmentation fault(core
dumped) and log you off.  I believe that will happen for any such command
as: "nnn^x" where control-x is any valid command.

Operating system: 4.1absd.
