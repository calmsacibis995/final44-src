Subject: recovering files in ex
Index: ucb/ex 4.2BSD

Description:
I have just come upon what appears to be a very annoying bug
in vi.  Following instructions to recover a file that had been
saved after I was disconnected I gave the command:

ex -r filename

I then entered visual mode, observed that the file was there,
and before making any changes exited as I usually do with

ZZ

expecting the file to be saved (I did not give it much thought,
it being my habitual way of leaving vi).

Not only was the recovered version not saved, but when I
attempted to recover it again, it was reported that the file
to be recovered could no longer be found.

If ZZ cannot be made safer, please at least change the mail
message about recovery to warn of this problem.

Repeat-By:
	Make changes to a file in vi without saving them;
	then stop vi and kill it to create a file to recover.
	After that give commands:

prompt  command               comment
%       ex -r filename        (to recover the file)
:       vi                    (to enter visual mode)
        1G                    (to see that file is there)
        ZZ                    (to leave the editor)
%       cat filename          (to observe that changes were not saved)
%       ex -r filename        (to observe that recovery is no longer possible)
