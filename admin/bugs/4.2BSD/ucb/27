Subject: msgs dies when quitting from more
Index: 	ucb/msgs.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If you invoke msgs with the -p flag and then
	quit from more such that it gets a SIGPIPE,
	msgs is killed (apparently) by the signal.
Repeat-By:
	Find a msg long enough and use more...
Fix:
	Should probably catch/ignore SIGPIPE when forking more.
