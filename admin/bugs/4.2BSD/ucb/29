Subject: symbolic link cycle
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a cycle of symbolic links exists, when vi is asked to open one of the
	files in the cycle, it gets a system error 62, which it should report as
	too many levels of symbolic links.  (Cat, for example, reports the error
	correctly.)  Instead, it reports "system error 62".
Repeat-By:
	ln -s tmp tmp1
	ln -s tmp1 tmp
	vi tmp
