Subject: tset passes wrong argument type
Index: 	ucb/tset/tset.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Tset can get an illegal instruction trap on certain machines.
	This is because it passes a short pointer to a function that is
	expecting an int pointer.
Repeat-By:
	(On a pyramid, type:)
		tset term-type
Fix:
	In setdelay, change the declaration of flags from
		int *flags;
	to
		short *flags;
