Subject: lastcomm does not always report very recently executed commands
Index: 	ucb/lastcomm.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The lastcomm command seems to improperly find the end of the
	process accounting file and therefor often fails to report
	on recently executed commands.
Repeat-By:
	On an idle system, run lastcomm a few times and watch the
	report grow in spurts rather than one command at a time.
Fix:
	The cheapest fix seems to be to use the blockcount field
	from the inode rather than bothering to calculate the
	last block by hand.  The following is a diff with a little
	context.

  		exit(1);
  	}
  	fstat(fd, &sb);
#ifdef	PUCC
  	for (bn = sb.st_blocks ; bn >= 0; bn--) {
#else	PUCC
  	for (bn = btodb(sb.st_size) - 1; bn >= 0; bn--) {
#endif	PUCC
  		lseek(fd, bn * DEV_BSIZE, L_SET);
  		cc = read(fd, buf, DEV_BSIZE);
  		if (cc < 0) {
