Subject: more's ul filter fails on certain terminals
Index: ucb/more/more.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	On certain terminals such as the tvi925, more(1) incorrectly
	handles underlining.  When the last word on a line is underlined
	more(1) sends a CR followed by the underline-off code instead of
	an underline-off code then a CR.

	On certain terminals this causes the remainder of the line up to
	the edge of the screen to be underlined.

Repeat-By:
	Get yourselves a tvi925 or similar terminal.  Try doing man on
	a few manual pages.  You'll soon find one where the last word
	on a line is underlined.  The tvi has other problems as well
	due to it needing a screen space for attributes.  This causes
	problems with the line endings which you should ignore for the
	purposes of this test.

Fix:
	Here is the fix.
