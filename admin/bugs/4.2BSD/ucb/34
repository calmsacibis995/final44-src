Subject:  dbx crashes the system
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.2BSD

Description:
	We are having problems with dbx, when a program is run under dbx,
	dbx crashes the system.  I don't know if the problem is with the 
	object code of dbx that we have, or there is a bug with the
	program.  We have try recompiling the source for dbx but that 
	have not helped.
Repeat-By:
	Try to run or execute a program while in dbx.
