Subject:  Netstat is SLOW, Fix
Sender: dpk@BRL-VGR.ARPA
Index:	ucb/netstat/inet.c 4.2BSD FIX

Description:
	Depressed at how slow netstat was on the VAX after hashing
the host tables, I profiled netstat and found that it was spending
90 percent of its time in inetname() and most of that in getnetent().
A look at the code revealed that it was ALWAYS trying to look up the
net name for a net even when that net was INADDR_ANY (all zeros).
After looking this up (and failing, since that is not a valid net),
it checked for that case and copied "*" into a buffer and returned.

Repeat-By:
	Run "time netstat -a".  Sit and wait.  Look at the large CPU time.

Fix:
	The fix is to move the check for INADDR_ANY to the start of the
inetname() function to catch this trivial case and prevent any expensive
and fruitless lookups. A diff listing follows, although the line numbers
will be offset due to a header we add to the file.  The fix is simple.
