Subject: Insufficient termcap space in "more"
Index: 	ucb/more/more.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	"more" can behave improperly with large ( > 100 byte )
	termcap entries, e.g., loss of standout mode for "-- More --"
	prompt.
Repeat-By:
	Inspection of the source will reveal the problem (see Fix
	below), but if you want to duplicate it:
	Set TERMCAP to a filename containing a termcap entry similar to
	that given below ( it is > 100 char's.), then invoke "more"
	on a file long enough to cause paging.  The symptom in my
	case was loss of standout mode for the "-- More --" prompt
	at bottom of screen.
	To duplicate the problem, TERMCAP should be set to a filename
	containing the termcap info, rather than having TERMCAP contain
	the entry itself.
Fix:
	In more.c:

	<     char	clearbuf[100];
	---
	>     char	clearbuf[TBUFSIZ];

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you really want to duplicate the problem, use this termcap entry,
with TERMCAP env. var. set to it's filename.
