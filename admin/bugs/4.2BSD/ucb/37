Subject: Franz Lisp minor version number in 4.2 BSD
Index: 	ucb/lisp 4.2BSD

Description:
	In the 4.2 BSD distribution, files in /usr/lib/lisp are
	minor version number .69, whereas the lisp and liszt binaries,
	and the source for the Franz Lisp system, is .79.
	Also, a "make slow" of the Franz Lisp system does not
	adequately clean out the old *.o files in /usr/lib/lisp.
Repeat-By:
	Inspection: "strings -a /usr/lib/lisp/version.o" shows it to be
	minor version number .69, whereas "lisp" and "liszt" reports
	.79.  This can result in a newly-built lisp and liszt reporting
	.69, if the following is done:

	    % cd /usr/src/ucb/lisp
	    % make fast

	(No "make copylibrary" was done since it was believed that
	/usr/lib/lisp was already the same as the source, since both
	were as distributed with 4.2 BSD.)
	This results in lisp and liszt being minor version .69,
	made from the .69 versions of /usr/lib/lisp/*.l .
	Later, when this is done:

	    % make copylibrary
	    % make slow

	the minor version remains .69, since the copylibrary is done
	with "tar", which preserves the original dates of the *.l
	source files, the /usr/lib/lisp/*.o files from the previous
	"make fast" have later dates than these *.l files, and hence
	the *.o files are not rebuilt from the version .79 *.l files, so
	the *.o files remain version .69.  These *.o files are then
	used to build lisp and liszt.
Fix:
	Obviously, the distributed /usr/lip/lisp should be made
	consistent with the source.
	However, the following change to the Makefile should be made
	to ensure that the /usr/lib/lisp/*.o files get rebuilt during
	a "make slow":

137c137
< 	(X=`pwd`; cd ${LibDir} ; make Liszt=$$X/${LisztD}/nliszt all)
---
> 	(X=`pwd`; cd ${LibDir} ; make Liszt=$$X/${LisztD}/nliszt clean all)

RCS log message:
----------------------------
Added "clean" to /usr/lib/lisp portion of "make slow", to avoid
this situation:
    1.  Installer does "make fast", leaving new .o and .x files in
	/usr/lib/lisp.
    2.  Installer later does "make copylibrary".  Since this is done
	with "tar", original dates of .l files are preserved.
    3.  A subsequent "make slow" (before the "clean" was added) will
	believe that /usr/lib/lisp is up-to-date, since new .l files
	are older than .o and .x files left from previous "make fast".
