Subject: Error doesn't know about f77's "Error.  No assembly." comment.
Index: 	ucb/error/errorinput.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Get extra output from error which confuses users.  For script
	under 'Repeat-By:', the initial output is:

			2 non specific errors follow
		[unknown] Error. No assembly.
		[unknown] Error. No assembly.
		2 files contain errors "file1.f" (2), "file2.f" (1)
		
		File "file1.f" has 2 errors.
			2 of these errors can be inserted into the file.
		
		File "file2.f" has 1 error.
			1 of these errors can be inserted into the file.
		You touched file(s): "file1.f", "file2.f"

	After the fix:
	
		2 files contain errors "file1.f" (2), "file2.f" (1)
		
		File "file1.f" has 2 errors.
			2 of these errors can be inserted into the file.
		
		File "file2.f" has 1 error.
			1 of these errors can be inserted into the file.
		You touched file(s): "file1.f", "file2.f"

Repeat-By:
	#
	cat << 'EOT' >! file1.f
		integer foobar(30)
		foobar(2) = a^b
		cal wow
		end
	'EOT'
	cat << 'EOT' >! file2.f
		print *, ' hi '
		badd
		end
	'EOT'
	f77 file1.f file2.f |& error

Fix:
	Diffs to fix errorinput.c:
	
	366d365
	< char    *F77_no_ass[3] = {"Error.","No","assembly."};
	378,385c377
	< 	 *
	< 	 *      also, from f77.c:
	< 	 *		Error.  No assembly.

	< 	if (wordc == 3 && (wordvcmp(wordv+1, 3, F77_no_ass)==0 ) ) {
	< 			wordc = 0;
	< 			return(C_SYNC);
