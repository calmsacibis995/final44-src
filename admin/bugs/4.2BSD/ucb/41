Subject: error -n and -t don't work as advertised
Index: 	ucb/error/errortouch.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	According to the manual:
		-n  	Do not touch any files; all error messages are sent to
			the standard output.
		-t	... Files whose suffixes do not appear in the suffix
			list are not touched ...
	However, these have no effect at all unless -q is also specified.
	I.e.  error -n   still touches files.  The -n and -t options only
	effect oktotouch() in errortouch.c; it is only called by preview().
	It is clear preview() can only return false unless -q is specified;
	so the effect of -n and -t are lost unless -q is specified.

	Here is the output for the 'Repeat-By:' script:

			1 non specific errors follow
		[unknown] Error. No assembly.
		1 file contains errors "bla.f" (1)
		
		File "bla.f" has 1 error.
			1 of these errors can be inserted into the file.
		You touched file(s): "bla.f"

	Either fix the code or fix the man page.

Repeat-By:
	#
	cat << 'EOT' >! bla.f
		fooey
	'EOT'
	f77 bla.f |& error -n
