Subject: "void" is not considered keyword by vgrind
Index: 	ucb/vgrind/vgrindefs.src 4.2BSD

Description:
	"void" is a keyword in C, and vgrind doesn't know it.
Repeat-By:
	Find a program which uses the (void) type cast.  Vgrind it.
	Look at the output.  Notice that "void" is not in bold
	font.  Realize that this is incorrect. :->
Fix:
	Add "void" to the list of keywords in ucb/vgrind/vgrindefs.src.
	Install /usr/src/ucb/vgrind/fbrindefs.src in /usr/lib/vgrinddefs
	by typing "make install".
