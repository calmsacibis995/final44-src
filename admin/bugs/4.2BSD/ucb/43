Subject: New dbx fails for f77 where old dbx worked
Index: 	ucb/dbx 4.2BSD

Description:
	New version of dbx on monet says "... not active" when asked
	about values of fortran subroutine arguments and common block
	elements.  Old version of dbx in /usr/ucb/dbx on opal prints
	out the values.
Repeat-By:
	
	# bug in dbx - can't display args and common block elements from f77
	cat << 'EOT' >! dbxbug.f
		common /const/ pi
		pi = 3.14159
		r = 2.0

		call sub(r)
		end

		subroutine sub(rr)

		ix=0
		j=rr/ix
		return
		end
	'EOT'
	f77 -g dbxbug.f
	a.out
	dbx << 'EOT'
	list
	print pi
	print r
	print rr
	'EOT'
