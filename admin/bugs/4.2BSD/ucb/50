Subject: rlogin prints raw control characters on the terminal
Index: 	ucb/rlogin.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	After a tilde escape, an entered control character is echoed on the
user's terminal, causing possibly undesireable behaviour (eg: ~^Z will cause
the screen to be cleared before suspending on a number of terminals).
Repeat-By:
	rlogin foo, then do a ~^Z.
Fix:
	Well, ^Z is probably a bad choice anyhow (z or Z would be better).
Still, rlogin could echo "uncntrl" version of control characters, based on
the local modes word associated with the user's tty.  The following is a diff
with a version that does that...

126d125
< int	ltword;		/* local mode word */
145d143
< 	ioctl(0, TIOCLGET, &ltword);
205d202
< 	static char ctlout[] = { "^x" };	/* yes, gives 3 chars for 0 */
265,275c262
< 			if ((((c&0x7f) < ' ') || ((c&0x7f) == 0x7f))
< 					&& (ltword & LCTLECH)) {
< 				if ((c&0x7f) < ' ') {
< 					ctlout[1] = '@'+(c&0x7f);
< 				} else {
< 					ctlout[1] = '?';
< 				}
< 				write(1, ctlout, 2);
< 			} else {
< 				write(1, &c, 1);
< 			}
