Subject: The sorry state of lock(1)
Index: 	ucb/lock.c 4.2BSD
Description: 
	The lock program is pretty unreasonable right now.  It is not a very
	good idea to have a hard-coded unlock password in the code, especially
	since the source is readable by some people.  To fix this, I suggest:
	1.	Allow the su password unconditional unlocking power.
	2.	If the user types an argument (say, "lock me"),
		it uses the user's password instead of prompting
		for one.
	These are much more reasonable ways of doing things.
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@berkeley

Repeat-By:
	Run the lock program.
Fix:
	I've got a reasonable version of the code if you like.
	Send mail to friedl@kentvax
