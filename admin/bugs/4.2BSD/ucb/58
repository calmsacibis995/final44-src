Subject: Script fails to handshake - FIX
Index: ucb/script.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	In an earlier communication I reported my XON/XOFF driven graphics
	terminal was losing characters under script although the scriptfile
	itself preserved the proper character stream.  I now can report a
	simple, tested fix.
Repeat-By:
	Use 4.2 script on a handshaking terminal that can't maintain its
	maximum baud rate for any length of time.  Don't forget to install
	pty devices for script to work with.
Fix:
	In subroutine fixtty() change RAW to CBREAK.  That's it.

	If you're conservative you might want to make the (unrelated)
	addition   setbuf(fscript, (char *) NULL);   immediately after
	opening the script file so as not to lose error messages if
	the script session terminates abnormally.  Another local
	modification I've made was to script the input from the terminal
	(to default file /dev/null) as well as the output to the terminal.
	This is handy for debugging graphics terminals and soft key
	output when no internal debug mode has been provided by the
	manufacturer.
