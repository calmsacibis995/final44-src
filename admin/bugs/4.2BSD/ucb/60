Subject: Obscure vi bug
Index: ucb/ex 4.2BSD

Description:
	with autoindent on and shiftwidth=4, I was entering a comment
	in a program of the form

	/*
	 *    this is a remark
	 *    about vi
	 */

	and found that the ^T was failing to "tab" over 4 spaces after
	each * character.

Repeat-By:
	Entering the string:

	O/*\n*^tthis is a remark\n*^tabout vi\n*/ESC

	where \n is the return key, ^t is CTRL-t, and ESC is the escape key.
