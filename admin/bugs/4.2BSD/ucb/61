Subject: 5^B clobbers the screen in vi.
Index: 	ucb/vi	4.2BSD

Description:
	In vi, a small number followed by ^B clobbers the screen
	and vi does some oddities for some keystroke if:
	   1. The cursor is near to the end of the file
	   2. The top line is out of the screen
	   3. At least three lines are on the screen.
	Then only ^B (not 5^B) can cure the anomaly.

	When there are only two lines in the screen, and 5^B is typed,
	the cursor moves to the third line from the bottom.

	If a few ^U is typed in that instance, the screen shows the half 
	page at the top of the text at the bottom again with possibly 
	some deleted test shown again. When a write is tried whether 
	succeed or not, the screen resumes the normal state.

Repeat-By:
	Create a text file with a few dozen (say 20) lines.
	Place the cursor in the first line.
	A few ^F creates a state satisfying the three conditions.
	Type 5^B. 
	Then the screen is filled with lines with ~ at the beginning,
	and the cursor is at the bottom of the screen.
	Repeat some of the aboves, say a few ^U.
