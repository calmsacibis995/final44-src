Subject: vi cannot redraw the screen when fg'ed.
Index: ucb/vi 4.2BSD

Description:
	When vi is fg'ed followed by suspending by ^Z
	while editing the file with a line wapped around more than two lines
	and with the cursor on the second line,
	it cannot redraw the screen until any keystroke is given.
Repeat-By:
	Create a file with a line longer than the screen width.
	 (typically 'set path' line in .login or .cshrc)
	Place the cursor at the second or more'th line of that line.
	Suspend vi by typing ^Z.
	fg after doing some work.
	Then the screen is not drawn until a key stroke is given.
