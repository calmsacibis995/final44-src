Subject: ruptime reports "0 users" when lots of users are in database
Index: ucb/ruptime.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When a particular /usr/spool/rwho/whod.xxx file has lots of users
	(the number appears to be around 36) the actual number is reported
	as "0 users" unless -a is specified.

	The problem is that the detail records are accessed backwards
	using "we = (struct whoent *)(buf+cc)" where "cc" is the return
	count from the read.  This will be BUFSIZ, so that "buf+cc" does
	not point to an even record boundary.

Repeat-By:
	Ask forty or so of your closest friends to log into some system or
	another and type "ruptime" -- you will see "0 users" reported.

Fix:
	Access the entries in such a way as to guarantee proper alignment:

------- ruptime.c -------
96,97c96,97
< 				we = (struct whoent *)(buf+cc);
< 				while (--we >= wd->wd_we)
---
> 				we = (struct whoent *)(buf+WHDRSIZE);
> 				for (i = cc / sizeof (struct whoent); i-- > 0; we++)
