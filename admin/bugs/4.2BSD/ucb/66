Subject: Pascal compiler behaves strangely on pointer assignment.
Index: 	ucb/pc 4.2BSD

Description:
        Depending on whether or not two pointers were declared in the
        same statement, they can or cannot be assigned to each other.

Repeat-By:
% cat > little.p
program ptest(input,output);
var
    i,j: ^integer;

begin
    new(i);
    j := i;
end.

In program ptest:
  w - variable j is never used


% cat > little.p

    j: ^integer;
