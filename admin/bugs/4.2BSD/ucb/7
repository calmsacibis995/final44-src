Subject: Bug in 4.2bsd which csh script
Index: 	ucb/which.csh 4.2BSD

Description:
	The which csh script won't tell you if a command is an alias,
	and will not read the path from the .cshrc as documented.  This
	is because it is exec'd with "csh -f", which does not read in the
	.cshrc file.
Repeat-By:
	Type "which xxx", where xxx is any alias defined in your .cshrc
	If the bug is present, "which" will not tell you that it is an
	alias.
Fix:
	Take the "-f" out of the top line of the script.
