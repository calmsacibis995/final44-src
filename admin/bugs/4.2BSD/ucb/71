Subject: Problem with :recover command in ex/vi
Index: 	ucb/ex/ex_cmds.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Recovering a "preserved" editor session following an editor
	crash with the :recover command does not cause the "changed" flag to 
	be set; an immediate ZZ will cause the recovered changes to be lost 
	forever.
Repeat-By:
	Edit an existing file with vi.  Cause an editor crash (pushing
	the white button on the front of the 750 is one way; a more friendly
	technique is the :preserve command).  Once more start up vi to edit the
	file and use :recover to restore things.  IMMEDIATELY enter ZZ to save
	the file.  Look at the saved file and notice that the carefully
	restored changes have disappeared.
