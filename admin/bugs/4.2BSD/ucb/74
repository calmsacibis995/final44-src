Subject: tset ignores environ TERM when mapping specified
Index: 	ucb/tset/tset.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	When any -m options are specified, tset ignores the TERM value
	in the envrinment and looks it up in /etc/ttytype.
	I know this is supposed to be a feature, but it is not.  The
	only time -m is typically used is .login files, and there the
	TERM variable is not corrupted yet, so no problem.  However,
	by ignoring TERM, tset breaks supdup, which wants to change
	TERM to "supdup".
Repeat-By:
	Try using supdup with some variation of
	tset -m 'network:?cavt'
	in your .login
Fix:
	Here is my change.  It's at about line 855.

	/* get current idea of terminal type from environment */
#ifdef OLDVERSION	so smart it defeats supdup   -gildea 26 jul 85
	if (!Dash_h && !Mapped && TtyType == 0)
#else
	if (!Dash_h && TtyType == 0)
#endif
		TtyType = getenv("TERM");
