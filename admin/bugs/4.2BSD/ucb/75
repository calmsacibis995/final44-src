Subject: rdist doesn't rdist if new mode
Index: ucb/rdist 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a file gets chmod'ed or chown'ed on the local system,
	it doesn't get changed on the remote system.
	Maybe rdist should have an option for this...
	By the way, this problem has screwed up many things on our systems.
Repeat-By:
	rdist a file -- chmod it -- try rdisting again...
