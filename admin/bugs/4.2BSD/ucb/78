Subject: netstat uses variable "socket"
Index: 	ucb/netstat/inet.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Netstat defines an external variable named "socket".  Since this is
	the name of a system call, it is not very good style.
Repeat-By:
	Try to compile netstat with library routines which try to use the
	socket() system call, such as the BIND domain resolver library.  The
	resulting object file will dump core.
Fix:
	Change the name of the variable in inet.c.
