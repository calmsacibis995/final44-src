Subject: vtroff eats the "-" option to troff incorrectly.
Index: 	ucb/vtroff 4.2BSD

Description:
	" cat foo | vtroff -me - " will fail.  The "-" will be
	read as an option and then troff will read standard input
	before the font width tables.  Vtroff appends another "-"
	since it thinks that the file is missing (and is not).
Repeat-By:
	try the above.
Fix:
	add the following case to the switch:
			....
		case -:			# This line matches the stdin arg.
			breaksw
		case -*:
			....
