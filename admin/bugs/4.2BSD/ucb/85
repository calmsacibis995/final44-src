Subject: Sendbug shows berkeley-centrisim by having "vi" wired in.
Index: 	ucb/sendbug.sh 4.2BSD

Description:
	Sendbug uses /usr/ucb/vi instead of $VISUAL.

Repeat-By:
	Learn emacs and become aware that it is indeed a way of life, and
	that as long as emacs exists, you might as well forget about vi.
	Set your VISUAL environment variable to "/usr/bin/emacs" and get used
	to it.  Try to send a bug report and become surprised and confused
	when you get plopped into a strange editor.
Fix:
	diff -c follows:
