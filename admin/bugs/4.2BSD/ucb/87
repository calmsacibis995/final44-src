Subject: filtering text leaves zombie process
Index: ucb/ex/ex_unix.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Filtering text through a command leaves a zombie proceess (one per
	filter) that doesn't go away until ex exits.  Result: people using
	the ! command end up running out of processes. 

Repeat-By:
	1) vi foo
	2) generate a couple of lines.
	3) !Gcat 
	4) now, stop vi and do a ps.  You will see a zombie process.
	5) foregroud vi, and repeat from step 3 to get as many
	   zombies as you want.
Fix:
	The fix is to wait for the undead process in ex_unix.c.  Following
	are the diffs.

	237d236
	< 	int mypid;      /* mwm: save our pid until after a unixex */
	244c243
	< 		mypid = fork();
	---
	> 		pid = fork();
	246c245
	< 		if (mypid < 0) {
	---
	> 		if (pid < 0) {
	251c250
	< 		if (mypid == 0) {
	---
	> 		if (pid == 0) {

	< 	    pid = mypid;
	< 	    waitfor();
