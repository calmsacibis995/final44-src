Subject: Man(1) makes "cat" files with wrong mode and ownership
Index:	ucb/man.c 4.2BSD
	ucb/Makefile 4.2BSD

Description:  When you run "man x" and the cat file has to be made, it is left
	with mode 0666, and owned by whoever happened to run man.  This was
	discovered one day when "man sh" produced neither output nor error
	message.  On investigation, it was found that /usr/man/cat1/sh.1
	was 0 length; some curious person must have tried to do something
	like "cat > /usr/man/cat1/sh.1"

Repeat-By:
	rm /usr/man/cat1/sh.1
	man sh
	ls -l /usr/man/cat1/sh.1

Fix:  Install the following 2-line patch.  Also, change the Makefile so
	man is installed set-uid.  I'll leave it to other, smarter, brains
	to figure out if this opens up any security loopholes.
