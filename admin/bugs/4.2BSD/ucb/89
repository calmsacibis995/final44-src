Subject: dbx & chars with 0200 bit
Index: 	ucb/dbx/printsym.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	dbx doesn't print strings which have characters with the 0200 bit set
	very well.  It sends the suspect characters unmodified to the terminal,
	which usually means they aren't seen at all.

Fix:
	In printsym.c, make printchar() look like this to get the
	octal-escape convention:

printchar(c)
char c;
{
    if (c == 0) {
	putchar('\\');
	putchar('0');
    } else if (c == '\n') {
	putchar('\\');
	putchar('n');
    } else if (c > 0 and c < ' ') {
	putchar('^');
	putchar(c - 1 + 'A');
    } else if (c & 0200) {
        printf("\\%o", c & 0377);
    } else {
	putchar(c);
    }
}
