Subject: Ex bug: % does not honor set (no)number sometimes
Index: 	ucb/ex 4.2BSD

Description: 
	In the ex editor, the % command does not immediately
	respond to set number or set nonumber.  There are several
	symptoms of what I believe to be this same problem:  When in set
	nonumber mode, it is necessary to issue either a nu or a p
	command before % will list the file with line numbers.  On
	the other hand, when going from numbered to no numbered
	mode via the set nonumber command, % still lists the file
	as numbered even after a nu command.  It is only after the
	p command that % begins to list the file in no numbered
	mode.
Repeat-By:
	1) Edit an existing text file using ex.
	2) issue:
		set nonumber
		1p
	3) issue:
		set number
		%
	{Note that the lines are NOT numbered when they are
	listed.}
	4) issue:
		p
		%
	{Note that the lines listed by % ARE now numbered.}
	5) issue:
		set nonumber
		%
	{Note that the lines listed by % ARE numbered.}
	6) issue:
		nu
		%
	{Note that the lines listed by % are STILL numbered.}
	7) issue:
		p
		%
	{Note that the lines listed by % are now unnumbered.}
	8) issue:
		set number
		nu
		%
	{Note that the lines listed by % are now numbered.}
