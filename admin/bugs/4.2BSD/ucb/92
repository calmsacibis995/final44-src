Subject: dbx can cause thrashing
Index:	ucb/dbx 4.1c

Description:
	If a program with a large global array is run under dbx,
	upon exiting dbx thrashing will occur.
Repeat-By:
	run dbx on the program

		int arr[1000000];
		main(){int i; i = arr[1];}

	Do a 'run' followed by a 'quit'.  At this point vmstat reveals
	the system paging out at a very hig rate (200 pages/sec), with
	system times of 70% (on an unloaded 780).
