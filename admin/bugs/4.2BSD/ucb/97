Subject: Franz Lisp reader case conversion bug

Index:  ucb/franz 4.2 

Description:
	Franz reader improperly converts atom names beginning with digits
	when (sstatus uctolc t) is enabled, as in Maclisp mode.
	A name of the form "1FOO" reads in as "1foo" but
	"1DOO" reads in as "1Doo", because the reader tries to scan
	the name as a number and accepts the D (or E) as a possible
	exponent indicator.  When "getnum" finds a non-numeric after
	the "D", it backs out, but does not perform upper case to lower
	case conversion when it does so.  Thus, the D or E remains in
	upper case but the remaining characters get converted to lower
	case.  

	The "D" and "E" characters are hard-coded in "getnum"; it isn't
	even possible to fix this by changing the readtable.  This makes
	the bug serious, since there is no simple work-around. 

	All Maclisp mode users with names of the form [0-9][DE].* will
	have this problem.

Repeat-By:
	(sstatus uctolc t)		; turn on upper case conversion
	(print '1ABCDEF)		; prints |1abcdef| -- OK
	(terpri)
	(print '1DEFABC)		; prints |1Defabc| -- WRONG
	(terpri)
