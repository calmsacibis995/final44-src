Subject: Strange handling of interrupts by vi
Index: ucb 4.2

Description:
	Vi version 3.7 has trouble when the interrupt character is
	typed too soon after the escape character.

Repeat-By:
	Enter vi and (rapidly) type the sequence <escape><interrupt>,
	hit ^L to fix the screen foobar that results, and then observe
	that a line containing the word "Interrupt" has replaced the
	current line.
