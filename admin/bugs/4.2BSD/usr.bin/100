or, things always work at Bell Labs, but the real world is something else
again.

Had a user mistakenly try to split a huge file into two pieces by saying
split -2 filename.  This filled his directory with thousands of files,
most of which he could not remove because they had characters with the
8th bit on in the name.  It seems that the next-to-last character of the
fabricated file name is just incremented indefinitely.  Fix:

<			fnumber++;
---
>			if(fnumber++ >= 26*26) {
>				fprintf(stderr,"Too many files\n");
>				exit(1);
>			}
