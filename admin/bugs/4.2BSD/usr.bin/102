Subject: refer not reliable if bibliography not in same directory
Index: usr.bin/refer 4.2BSD

Description:
  refer will not find some bibliography entries if the bibliography file
is not in the same directory.  Moving the paper usiing the bibliography
to the same directory as as the bibliography will clear the references. The
references are cited as [0] and appear in the list of references at the end
however.
Repeat-By:
    can supply a sample file that has this problem.
