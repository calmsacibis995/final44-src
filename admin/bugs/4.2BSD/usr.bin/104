Subject: struct. kills lines below computed gotos and if else endif bug
Index: usr.bin/struct 4.2BSD

Description:
(1) struct doesnt convert computed goto's into switch blocks as it says it does.
It completely ignores the computed goto and loses lines after computed goto
statments.
(2) struct doesnt convert if else endif blocks to ratfor, it leaves
the else endif's without {}'s.
Repeat-By:
	write(6,*) 'enter 1 or 2'
	read(5,*) i
	goto(1,2) i
1	write(6,*) 'goto ',i
	goto 3
2	write(6,*) 'goto ',i
3	continue
	if(i.eq.1) then
		write(6,*) 'if ',i
	else
		write(6,*) 'if ',i
	endif
	end
