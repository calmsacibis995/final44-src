Subject: ^D after abstract entry causes addbib to loop
Index: usr.bin/refer/addbib.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Addbib prompts for entry of an abstract after the author, title,
	etc. fields have been filled in.  Abstract entry is to be terminated
	by ^D.  When ^D is typed, addbib loops infinitely and prints junk
	on the screen.

Repeat-By:
	Invoke addbib and enter some dummy data.  After the program prompts
	for an abstract enter something and terminate it with a ^D. 

Fix:
	Stdin is continually returning EOF, causing this problem.
	After the abstract entry loop and the error check, add the
	following lines:
		if (feof(stdin))
			clearerr(stdin);
	For more precise positioning, a diff -c follows.
