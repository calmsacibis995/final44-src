Return-Path: <ukma!david@ANL-MCS.ARPA>

Hi.  2 things.  First is a bug in uucp, text follows, it has already
been reported to net.bugs.4bsd.  Second is a question.  Do you all
keep a mailing list of people to send bug fixes to?  Y'see, we just
recently got attached to our first network, and hadn't been able to
receive such things until now.  Or are the only bug fixes sent out on
usenet?  Forgive me if I am asking silly questions, but I am new to
networking these networks.

Thank you, David Herron.

Index:	usr.bin/uucp/uuxqt.c 4.2BSD

Description:  I was just setting up our first uucp connections and
	was having trouble with a command like:

		uux "ukgs\!who >ukma\!~uucp/ukgs.who"

	It was going and doing the execute but decided it could not
	create the output file.  Looking at the code (Ours is that
	distributed from Berkeley with 4.2) I eventually found that
	uuxqt was checking if it could create the output file for
	any non-spool-area output file, even for files going to another
	system.  This doesn't make sense since uucp doesn't know
	anything about its rights to create a file on another system.

Repeat by:	Use the above command string.  (make sure who is 
	executable from remote).  Any command which produces output
	and sent back to another system will do.

Fix:	Apply the following code.  Your line numbers will vary with
	the mileage of your fingers and source file(s).

Notes:	I would appreciate any comments on this patch.  I don't know
	if it creates any gaping security holes or not.

-  *---	[22-Aug-84 dsh]: Problem: Output files to be routed back to another

-  *	The condition controlling the printing of this message is
-  *	"(argnok || badfiles)".  The value of argnok was tested by defining

-  *	noticed that for X_STDOUT, chkpth() and chkperm() were being called
-  *	when the output file was to be sent back to a remote system.
-  *	Fix:  Have the program check sysout to see if the file is to go
-  *	to another system and NOT execute chkpth() and chkperm() if so.
