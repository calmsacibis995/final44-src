Subject: efl compiler bombs every time
Index: usr.bin/efl 4.2BSD
Apparently-To: Shasta!4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY

Description:
	The distributed efl compiler bombs off every time with a
	"calloc(1024)" error.   The problem is the efl compiler
	has its own alloc.c memory allocator with entries calloc
	and malloc.  The stdio routines try to dynamically allocate
	buffers using these entries and whammo!
Repeat-By:
	Installing the 4.2 distribution efl compiler.
Fix:
	Change names to cal_loc and mal_loc to protect the innocent.
	A quick kludge that might work is to use setbuf(3) to avoid
	stdio calloc()/malloc() calls.
