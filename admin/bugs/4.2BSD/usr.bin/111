Subject: sort core dumps intermittently
Index: usr.bin/sort.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	On a Vax 11/780 running UNIX 4.2bsd, running sort on various size
	ascii files (1-40+ Mbytes) and sorting on multiple fields
	(ie: "sort +0 -1 +3 -4 <filename>"), it SOMETIMES crashes,
	leaving a core file.  Message returned is "Illegal instruction".
	Crash occurences seem to be evenly distributed over various
	size files.

	Used adb and dbx to look at core file (we have source code license).
	This resulted in identifying that during the merge process of the
	sort, in the subroutine "cmp", the contents of the program counter
	(pc) is being shifted.  It seems to shift such that it is one or
	two bytes off the instruction (I am not being vague here, sometimes
	it is one byte off, sometimes it is two bytes off).

	Possible hardware problems have been checked and ruled out by our
	engineers.

Repeat-By:
	The occurences of the crash do not seem to share a common set of
	circumstances, and we have not been able to repeat the problem by
	repeating the command on the same file, though we have tried this
	under various load conditions, and with various mixes of processes
	running.
