Subject: ranlib gives "__.SYMDEF: old format .o file" if the first 4 bytes
	happen to match a valid majic number.
Index: usr.bin/ranlib.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Ranlib-ing libraries that already exist (have a __.SYMDEF) file
	as the first file in the library may give the 

		"ranlib: <libname>(__.SYMDEF): old format .o file"
	
	error message if the first four bytes are !N_BADMAJ (valid).
	Before entering the main "do" loop i read the first header to see
	if it is __.SYMDEF.   This keeps the code more effecient and
	gaureentes the bug will not manifest itself.
Repeat-By:
	Must generate a __.SYMDEF file with a valid magic number as the
	first four bytes.
Fix:
	The following is a diff from the source version:
