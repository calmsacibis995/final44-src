Subject: problem with "learn" environment
Index: usr.bin/learn 4.2BSD

Description:
	When running "learn", the environment is not always properly
	set.
Repeat-By:
	Use this .login file:

	setenv	EXINIT	"set ai sh=$SHELL"
	alias	ts	set noglob \; eval \`tset -s \!\*\` \; unset noglob
	ts -Q -n -r -m switch:\?z29-e -m network:\?z29 \?$term

	Login, then:

	% learn files
	[...noise...]
	% printenv

	You will notice that [at least] the TERM envariable is missing.
	If you do:

	% unsetenv EXINIT

	before running "learn", TERM is set.  In different login
	environments using the *same* EXINIT, the problem disappears.

	I don't have a fix for this obscure problem... sorry.
