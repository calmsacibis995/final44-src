Subject: Error in \n(.w computation in troff.
Index: usr.bin/troff 4.2BSD

Description:
	There are a series of special
character generating strings in /usr/lib/me/chars.me
which make extensive use of overstriking
where the characters to be overstruck are
(presumably) centered, e.g., accent marks,
over the primary character.  The \\n(.w escape
sequence is used to determine how far to back
up to make the proper appearance.
Unfortunately, it does not appear that \\n(.w
computes the width of the last substantive
or printing character, but rather the last
character of any type.  In the chars.me file
it is common to do the following, in a
grossly simplified manner
.ds , \k_\h'-(\\n(.wu)'\*(#[,\h'|\\n_u'\*(#]
	This is attempting to place a comma
under a letter in some sane fashion.
Unfortunately, it seems that .w has the width
of either the - or the ' in it, or maybe the
(.
Repeat-By:
	Try troffing the following for some
sort of laser printer.
.ie \nA=0 .ds . \k_\h'-(\\n(.wu-\*(#h-0.05m)'\d\v'-0.3m'\*(#[.\h'|\\n_u'\u\v'+0.3m'\*(#]
	This works with tmac.e and the
special character file soed in.
If you troff this with, e.g.,
 This is a dot under an H "H\*."
You will see that the dot is not centered.
My belief is that the .w register is set not
to the last visible character, but to the
last character before the invocation of
\\n(.w, which is not what one wants (I don't
think).
