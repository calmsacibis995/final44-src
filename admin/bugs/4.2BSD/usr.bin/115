Subject: lint errors from constant expressions
Index: usr.bin/lint/? 4.2BSD

Description:
	Lint seems to have a serious problem evaluating non-integer constant 
	expressions, and seems to think that far too many of them involve 
	division by zero.
Repeat-By:
	lint the following piece of code:
--------------
#define CONST 0.5e0
main() {
	double a;
	a = CONST/(1.0 - CONST);
	printf("a is %G\n",a);
	exit(0);
}
---------------
and get the informative lint output:
test.c:
test.c(4): division by 0.

The value of CONST has no effect on the result, nor does changing the 1.0
to anything else reasonable.  Adding casts to float or double all over
the expression similarly has no effect.  The C Compiler has no
trouble with it, and generates the correct result.
