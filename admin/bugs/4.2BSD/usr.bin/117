Subject: The FIND command aborts with segmentation fault.
Index: usr.bin/find/find.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The "find" command aborts with a segmentation fault when using the
	syntax "find <name>".  The abort is caused by an "fprintf" call
	which fails to pass "stderr" as a parameter.

	This problem occurs when the file FCODES, i.e., /usr/lib/find/find.codes
	is not present.

	Secondary to this problem, the installation Makefile and source
	should properly install /usr/lib/find/find.codes.

Repeat-By:

	find <anyname>
Fix:
	Change: fprintf ( " find: can't open %s\n", FCODE)
	  to:   fprintf ( stderr, " find: can't open %s\n", FCODE)
	
	Modify the installation Makefile to install /usr/lib/find/find.codes.
	Provide source for /usr/lib/find/find.codes with the installation
	materials.
