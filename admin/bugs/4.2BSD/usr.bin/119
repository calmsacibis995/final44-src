Subject: 4.[123]bsd ".ne"eds too much (with fix)
Index: usr.bin/tbl/t7.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The "tbl" command may output a troff ".ne" directive that's larger
	than the size of the table being produced.

Repeat-By:
	Create a file with these lines (eliminating the leading indent):

		echo '
		.TS
		box ;
		l l .
		x
		_	_
		x
		.TE
		' | tbl | fgrep .ne

	(Note that the character between the two underscores above is a tab.)

	Now run the file through "sh" and note the result:

		.ne 3v+0p

	Next edit the above file, changing the line with the two underscores
	to a line with just a single underscore on it.  Run the file through
	"sh" again and note the result:

		.ne 2v+2p

	Even though the two versions of the file produce identical-looking
	output when "typeset," the size that tbl claims is needed is different.

Fix:
	Here's the fix to the 4.1bsd version of "src/tbl/t7.c".
	The fix is an addition to the function "need", conditioned on
	"OLDVERSION":

		need()
		{
		int texlin, horlin, i;
		for(texlin=horlin=i=0; i<nlin; i++)
			{
			if (fullbot[i]!=0)
				horlin++;
			else
			if (instead[i]!=0)
				continue;
			else
		#ifndef OLDVERSION
			if (allh(i))
				horlin++;
			else
		#endif
				texlin++;
			}
		fprintf(tabout, ".ne %dv+%dp\n",texlin,2*horlin);
		}
