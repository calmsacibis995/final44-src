Subject: struct command fails under csh
Index: usr.bin/struct 4.2BSD

Description:
	Using struct(1) when your login shell is csh(1) fails with
	the message "command trap not found".  One of our people
	managed to lose a source file when they tried this.  (Sorry,
	I don't have any idea how he managed that! it's not struct's
	fault.)
Repeat-By:
	Running struct under an interactive csh.
Fix:
	add the initial line

	#! /bin/sh

	to the struct shell command file.
