Subject: tip bug in v3451.c
Index: usr.bin 4.2BSD

There is a bug in the racal-vadic driver (aculib/v3451.c) of tip.
It doesn't raise DTR (or for that matter, clear DTR) as does the ventel
driver.  The change goes in the v3451_dialer routine.  The first thing
it does should be:

	ioctl(FD, TIOCCDTR, 0);
	sleep(2);
	ioctl(FD, TIOCSDTR, 0);
