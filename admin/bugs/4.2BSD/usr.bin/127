Subject: uucp bug
Index: usr.bin 4.2BSD

I think I have found a real minor bug in the 4.2bsd uucp.  It seems the routine
"mailst()" is defined twice, once all by itself in the file mailst.c and a
second time in the file sdmail.c  Both of these files are included in the
uucp library created.  The routines seem to do the same thing, however
the routine in mailst.c is a superset of the routine in sdmail.c in that
it has a third argument which if not null is interpreted to be a file that
is opened and mailed along with the message.  The only time the sdmail.c
routine is used is in the other routine in the file sdmail.c.  My fix
was to eliminate the mailst() routine from sdmail.c and add a third (null) 
argument to all calls to mailst() in sdmail.c.
