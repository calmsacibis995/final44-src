Subject: Multiple citations of same reference in refer prevent proper sorting of footnotes.
Index: usr.bin/refer 4.2 Fix

Description:
	If the -s option is specified, and if an inverted index exists
	for the references file, and if a particular source is cited
	more than once, then the second and subsequent citations
	interfere with the citations that follow THEM.  The interfered-
	with citations are given footnote number zero and are listed at
	the END of the bibliography, regardless of where they belong in
	the proper sorted order.

Repeat-By:
	refer -p references paper

	Where 'references' contains the following:

%A R. Finkel
%A M. Solomon
%A D. DeWitt
%A L. Landweber
%T The Charlotte Distributed Operating System:
Part IV of The First Report on the Crystal Project
%R Technical Report
%I University of Wisconsin - Madison
%D 1983

%A R. E. Strom
%A S. Yemini
%T NIL: An Integrated Language and System for Distributed Programming
%V 18

%A N. Wirth
%T Modula: a Language for Modular Multiprogramming
%J Software--Practice and Experience
%V 7
%D 1977
%P 3-35

	And 'paper' contains the following:

First reference to Charlotte:
.[
charlotte first crystal report
.]
Another reference:
.[

.]
Second reference to Charlotte:
.[

.]
Reference that gets screwed up:
.[
strom yemini nil distributed system
.]
References:

$LIST$
.]

Fix:
	patch modules refer5.c and refer2.c as follows:

% diff /usr/src/usr.bin/refer/refer5.c refer5.c
18c18,19
< putsig (nf, flds, nref, nstline, endline)	/* choose signal style */
---
> putsig (nf, flds, nref, nstline, endline, dup)	/* choose signal style */
> 	/* mls: dup is Boolean; says this is a duplicate reference */
142c143,145
< 			fprintf(fo,".ds [F %s%c",t,sep);
---
> 			if (!dup)
> 				fprintf(fo,".ds [F %s%c",t,sep);
> 					/* do not print sig on fo for duplicate reference */
% diff /usr/src/usr.bin/refer/refer2.c refer2.c
115c115,116
< 						putsig(nf,flds,nr,line1,line);
---
> 						putsig(nf,flds,nr,line1,line, 1);
> 							/* 1 indicates duplicate entry */
132c133,134
< 		putsig(nf, flds, refnum, line1, line);
---
> 		putsig(nf, flds, refnum, line1, line, 0);
> 			/* 0 indicates new reference; not duplicate */
