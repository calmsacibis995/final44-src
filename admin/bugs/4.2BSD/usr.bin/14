Subject: refer %Q field is ignored when sorting references by author
Index: usr.bin/refer 4.2 Fix

Description:
	When refer is asked to sort references on the basis of author
	name (-sA option) it should consider %Q fields as well as %A.
Repeat-By:
	This is a well-known bug (mentioned in user's manual).
Fix:
	Modify source file refer5.c as follows:

% diff /usr/src/usr.bin/refer/refer5.c refer5.c
158c162,165
< 		if (flds[i][1] == c && ++fnd >= seq) {
---
> 	/* mls: following if statement modified to cope with Q authors */
> 		if ((flds[i][1] == c || (c == 'A' && flds[i][1] == 'Q'))
> 				&& ++fnd >= seq) {
> 			c = flds[i][1];
160c167
< 			if (c == 'T' || c == 'J') {
---
> 			if (c == 'T' || c == 'J' || c == 'Q') {

Subject: refer bugs

The first bug report abort the -s option is clearly fixed on 4.3 so the report
only applied to 4.2.

Regarding the  second bug: the fact that the %Q field is ignored when sorting
references by author.

The suggested fix looks valid.  My comment about the %Q feature
in general is that refer documentation suggests that it is
supported to a greater extent than the code reflects.  The document
"Refer -- A Bibliography System" by Tuthill (/usr/doc/usd/29.refer)
gives the impression that %Q author names will be treated like %A
author names in every respect except that %Q names will not be reversed
by the -a flag.  This is not the case.  This patch addresses one
exception.  There are others.  For example, refer collects %A names
into one nroff/troff string definition like this:

	.ds [A Manny Pep
	.as [A ", Moe Pep
	.as [A ", and Jack Pep

%Q names are not included in this treatment.

If people attempt to use %Q and %A in the same reference they are
likely to be disappointed.  Also if they attempt to place multiple %Q
fields in one reference [to handle several "foreign" authors] only the
last %Q author will be printed.

The author of bugreport says it's a well known bug mentioned in
the User's Manual.  I was curious about that, but could not locate
references to the bug in the User's Manual.
