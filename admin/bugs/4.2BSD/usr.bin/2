Subject: Bugs on "learn" program
Index: usr.bin/learn 4.2BSD

Description:
		1. Can not specify the user directory.
		2. Can not specify the subject.
Repeat-By:
		1. "learn -tmpdir C 1.1f" does NOT work, but
		   "learn C 1.1f" does work.
		2. After type "learn -tmpdir", you will see some
		   of the guiding message missing and also cannot
		   specify the subject.
