Subject: addbib goes into infinite loop
Index: 	usr.bin/refer/addbib.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	addbib asks you to enter an abstract, terminated by a ^D.
	You terminate with a ^D and the program goes into an infinite
	loop.
Repeat-By:
	Try it and see (oh, the fun you will have)!
Fix:
	Here is one possible solution.  Clear the EOF indicator and check
	whether there is more input.  A simple
		diff addbib.c.dist addbib.c
	follows:
170c170,172
< 			fgets(line, BUFSIZ, stdin);
---
> 		clearerr(stdin);
> 		if (fgets(line, BUFSIZ, stdin) == NULL)
> 			return;
