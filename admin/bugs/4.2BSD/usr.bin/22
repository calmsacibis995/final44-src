Subject: refer generating unprintable suffix letters
Index: usr.bin/refer 4.2BSD

Description:
	When refer is told to generate a unique suffix character
	for interpolated signals, the suffix characters generated
	are the sequence \000, \001, \002, etc.  rather than
	'a', 'b', 'c', ...
Repeat-By:
	"refer -kL"  with a "%L Author, 1980-" in the reference list.
Fix:
	Change the declaration "x = -1;" in subroutine keylet() of
	file refer5.c to "x = 'a' -1;" instead.

	Admittedly this really only patches an option of refer that
	doesn't operate in a useful way anyhow.  What is really wanted
	is for refer to interpolate the additional letter only when
	more than one reference by the same authors and date is included
	in the document and then to follow that up with the same change
	in the stored, sorted reference list.  This is, of course, what
	most journals insist on.

	Also, a good deal more flexibility is desirable in formatting
	interpolated signals so that, for example, references of the 
	form   "Smith (1980) says ..."   and of the form   "some critics
	(Smith, 1980; Jones, 1982) ..."   can appear in the same document
	without post-refer editing.
