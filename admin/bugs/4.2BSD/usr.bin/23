Subject: efl chokes on the new stdio.
Index: usr.bin/efl 4.2BSD

Description:
	efl(1) crashes in flames (i.e. in infinite recursion) when run even
on trivial programs. One of the causes is that the author included a
"very stupid" memory allocator in his program, called at various levels as
intalloc(), alloc(), calloc(), malloc(), cfree(), and free().
It is not able to handle allocations of more than 256 longwords at a chunk.
Unfortunately, he uses stdio, which trustingly calls malloc() and free()
with 4096 byte arguments in _filbuf() and fclose(). Worse, his fatal error
handler also calls exit() --> _cleanup() --> fclose().

Repeat-By:
	echo '' > a.e
	efl a.e

Fix:
	Use setbuf(3S) after each fopen().  May not solve everything.
Please run programs once before distributing them.
