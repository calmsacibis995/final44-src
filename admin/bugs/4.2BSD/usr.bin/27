Subject: uucp crashes on error (vadic modem)
Index: usr.bin/uucp/conn.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When a write fails when calling, uucp closes up the modem, which
	causes cleanup action which triggers another write to the modem,
	which fails, which...
Repeat-By:
	Have uucp fail to get through.
Fix:

	conn.c:
627c627,631
< 	ASSERT(write(fd, t, 1) == 1, "BAD WRITE", "", t[0]);
---
> 	/* if we ASSERT the following write, we may end up calling ourselves*/
> 	/* We could have clsacu() check for reentry, but why? If this write
> 		fails, the reads will eventually fail as well. That'll
> 		kill us for sure anyway.				*/
> 	write(fd, t, 1);
