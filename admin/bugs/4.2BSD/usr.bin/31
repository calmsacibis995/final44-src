Subject: tip can't read phones/remote files
Index: usr.bin/tip/tip.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When the suggested security permissions of 600 are placed on
	/etc/phones and /etc/remote (uid uucp; gid spooling) tip fails
	because it cannot read the files.
Repeat-By:
	Put 600 permissions on /etc/phones and /etc/remote and try to tip.
Fix:
	tip resets the user and group id's too early in its processing.
	Thus when it goes to read the aforementioned files, it no longer
	has the setuid permissions that matched those files.  The fix is
	to move the lines

	setgid(getgid());
	setuid(getuid());
