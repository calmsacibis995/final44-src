Subject: lint confused by static declarations
Index: usr.bin/lint 4.2BSD

Description:
	static declarations appearing in #include files and used
	later on in the source file that #include'ed them cause
	lint to complain that (1) the variable is defined
	but not used in the #include file and (2) the variable
	is used but not defined in the source file.
	The same program, when compiled executes properly.
	It seems lint restricts static declarations to within
	the actual file in which they appear (i.e. the #include file)
	rather than the more liberal interpretation of any source
	file that includes the declaration.
Repeat-By:
	Include file "pi.h":

		static double pi=3.1415926535;

	Source file "bug.c":

		#include "pi.h"
		main()
		{
		    printf("2pi=%f\n",2.0*pi);
		}

	Command:
		lint -lc bug.c

	Result:
		bug.c:
		pi defined( ./pi.h(1) ), but never used
		pi used( bug.c(4) ), but not defined
