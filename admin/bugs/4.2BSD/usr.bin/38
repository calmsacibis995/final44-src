Subject: iostat in error when external clock used to gather stats
Index: usr.bin/iostat.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	After we employed the kgclock (adapted to our ancient AR11) driver
	to gather I/O and profiling samples, some of the numbers given by
	iostat were off by a factor of 10.  As we were running the external
	clock at 10HZ and the internal clock runs at 100HZ, it was easy to
	find the cause.  iostat (and vmstat) were not reading the "phz"
	variable from the kernel's namelist and simply assuming it identical
	to the kernel's "hz" variable.
Repeat-By:
	Collecting samples using an external clock set to other than 100HZ.
Fix:
	Read both "phz" and "hz" from /dev/kmem and use the former sampling
	rate if it is nonzero.  Be aware, however, that it may not have been
	calibrated correctly.  kgclock supposedly counts the number of external
	clock interupts occurring over a four second interval as measured using
	the system clock.  However when we looked at phz (using adb) it was 3
	not 10!   We cured the problem by explicitly initializing all relevant
	variables to zero on entry to the kgstart() routine.  I can't say for
	sure why it fixed the bug, but either an unitialized variable was
	the culprit or the system modifies its idea of the time between the
	kgprobe() and kgstart() calls.
