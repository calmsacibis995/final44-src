Subject: Nroff sometimes trashes current directory permissions
Index: 	usr.bin/troff/n1.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Nroff will occasionally change the permission of the current directory
	to be unexecutable by everyone.  (In fact the directory permission
	becomes the default tty device permission.)  What is happening is that
	ttyname() is being used twice and the earlier value is being re-used
	after the second call to ttyname.  (Note we have modified ttyname(3)
	on our system slightly, so this next assertion may not apply:)
	ttyname() returns a static char *; and the second call almost always
	returns NULL but also re-initializes the static buffer to "".
	This has the effect of doing a chmod("", original-tty-name), which
	(Viola!) clobbers the current directory permission.

Repeat-By:
	Unfortunately, I am not quite clear on how to repeat this reliably.
	I believe you must run nroff with standard output redirected but
	not standard input or error.  This is a hypothesis only.

Fix:
	I can't provide good diffs because we changed a few other things in
	our nroff; but here is a description of the fix.  Basically we are
	strcpy'ing the first value of ttyname.  To the beginning of the
	file add a buffer

		char ttynamebuf[128];

	after

		char *ttyp;

	Then, in init2(), after the three lines of if statement inwhich
	ttyname() plays a major role, add

		if (ttyp)
			ttyp = strcpy(ttynamebuf, ttyp);

	This should fix the problem.
