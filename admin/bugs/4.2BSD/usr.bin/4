Subject: assigns in f77
Index: 	usr.bin/f77 4.2BSD

Description:
	assigns apparently do not work with statement numbers that
	appear later than the assign statement itself.
Repeat-By:
Create a file called dumb.F containing:
	program dumb
	integer	line,i
#ifndef BUG
100	format(i5)
#endif
	i=123
	assign 100 to line
	print line,i
	stop
#ifdef BUG
100	format(i5)
#endif
	end
Compiled as 'f77 dumb.F', it works, with output '  123'.
Compiled as 'f77 -DBUG dumb.F', it doesn't, and I get:
*	write sfe: [100] error in format
*	logical unit 6, named 'stdout'
*	lately: writing sequential formatted external IO
*	part of last format: ^D
