Subject: Calendar pattern match bug
Index: usr.bin/calendar/calendar.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Calendar doesn't recognize tabs as valid white space,
	which can cause wrong dates to be recognized as valid.
Repeat-By:
	Put a line like:

	month<tab>number

	in a file called calendar in the current directory,
	where number is the current day of the month, with an extra
	digit or two prepended to it.  Run /bin/calendar, and the
	line will be printed out, even though it shouldn't be.
Fix:
	In tprint(), change the two lines indicated in the diff below:

diff oldcalendar.c calendar.c
33c33
< 	printf("(^|[ (,;])((%s[^ ]* *|(0%d|%d)/)0*%d)([^0123456789]|$)\n",
---
> 	printf("(^|[ (,;])((%s[^ ]*[ ]*|(0%d|%d)/)0*%d)([^0123456789]|$)\n",
36c36
< 	printf("(^|[ (,;])((\\* *)0*%d)([^0123456789]|$)\n",
---
> 	printf("(^|[ (,;])((\\*[ \t]*)0*%d)([^0123456789]|$)\n",
