Subject: refer: incorrect citation labels
Index: usr.bin/refer/refer5.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When refer is run with the -l flag it builds citation labels
	from reference data fields, usually author and date, e.g.
	Jones1984.  If two cited references result in the same label,
	refer attempts to disambiguate the labels by appending a
	character.  The appended character should be a lowercase
	letter (a, b, c, ...).  Instead a control character 
	(^A, ^B, ^C, ...) is appended.

Repeat-By:
	Create a reference database containing two references
	which have the same author (%A) and date (%D); create
	a document which cites the two references; 

		refer -l document

	Notice that the label constructed for the second cited
	reference ends with ^A.
Fix:
	Modify the routine keylet in refer5.c.  Add code to
	adjust the value of x before the return:

	if (x == 0)	/* The last reference to use this signal 
			** was put out plain; this reference
			** needs disambiguating character 'a'.
			*/
		x = 'a'-1;
	return(labc[nref] = x+1);

Comment:
	There is a related problem.  Currently the disambiguating
	characters are issued on the first pass through the document.
	If a duplicate label situation arises, the first label has no
	character appended.  This results in sets of labels such as
	Jones1984, Jones1984a, Jones1984b instead of
	Jones1984a, Jones1984b, Jones1984c.  If the references are
	printed as a sorted list (-s) the labels are usually out of
	order.

	It would be preferable to issue the characters after all
	citations have been seen, and after any sorting has been done
	(in a manner similar to that in which numeric labels are now
	adjusted after sorting).

	If we implemented this change what are the chances that it
	would be incorporated in future distributions.
