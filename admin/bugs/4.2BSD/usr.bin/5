Subject: cb crashes

Index: usr.bin/cb 4.2BSD

Description:

	The C beautifier "cb" gave me a segmentation violation when I tried
	to format one of my files.  By experimenting, I was able to construct
	a small program that exhibited the apparent bug.

Repeat-By:

	Place the following program in a file "foo.", and enter the command
	"cb <foo.", and note the segmentation violation.  If the apostrophe is
	removed from the comment, or the comment is moved outside the "for"
	statement, or even if an identical second "for" line is placed in the
	program, "cb" works correctly.

		/* START OF PROGRAM */

		main()
		{
			short i;

			for (i = 0; i < 2; /* doesn't work */ ++i);
		}

		/* END OF PROGRAM */
