Subject: uuxqt bug with a badly logjammed spool directory
Index: 	usr.bin/uucp/{anlwrk,uuxqt}.c 4.2 BSD

Description:
	When uuxqt accumulates more than 20 X. files with no associated
	D. files, all work comes to a screeching halt.
Repeat-By:
	Start running uucp connections.  Wait for anywhere from an hour
	to a week or two, depending on traffic.  Check with "uusnap" for
	accumulated X. files.
Fix:
	uuxqt can only work on 20 files at any given time.  If these X.
	files do not have the associated D. files, and if enough high
	grade orphan X. files accumulate, uuxqt will eventually stop
	processing anything.  Fix gtwrkf() in uuxqt.c so that it checks
	for "old" orphan X. files and either logs a message or unlinks the
	files, depending on a compile switch.  There are also some changes
	to anlwrk.c and uucp.h.  First, uuxqt.c


uuxqt.c log:
----------------------------
version 1.6        
date: 84/10/08 14:43:21;  author: joe;  state: Exp;  lines added/del: 2/1
Fix editing (really formatting) mistake which crept into v1.5
----------------------------
version 1.5        
date: 84/10/04 12:00:27;  author: joe;  state: Exp;  lines added/del: 3/2
Add log message for old X. files if UNLINK_OLDX is not defined.
This way, you can check the LOGFILE for old files and unlink them
by hand.
----------------------------
version 1.4        
date: 84/04/10 15:02:34;  author: joe;  state: Exp;  lines added/del: 2/0
Made unlinking of work files conditionally compiled on switch
UNLINK_OLDX.  Default is not to include the code.
----------------------------
version 1.3        
date: 84/02/29 14:04:53;  author: joe;  state: Exp;  lines added/del: 3/2
Fixed problem with previous fix whereby uuxqt would not process any
work files if the first one it encounters did not 'gotfiles()'.  I
moved the second iswrk call in gtxfile() to after the while loop which
looks for old X. files and conditionally return 0 if no work, otherwise
I go back and loop some more.

----------------------------
version 1.2        
date: 84/02/21 13:33:51;  author: joe;  state: Exp;  lines added/del: 23/0
Modified gtxfiles() so that if an X. file exists but does not have all
of its associated D. files and it is older than 1 day, we try to unlink
it to keep the X. queue from overflowing and messing up things.  Change
suggested by Tom Truscott via rlgvax.

Obviously, you also have to #define LLEN and MAXRQST in uucp.h.  I leave
that as an exercise for the reader.
