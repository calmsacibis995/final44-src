Subject: bug in racal-vadic driver in tip
Index: usr.bin/tip/aculib/v3451.c 4.2 Fix

Description:
	There is a bug in the racal-vadic driver (aculib/v3451.c) of tip.
	It doesn't raise DTR (or for that matter, clear DTR) as does the ventel
	driver.

Repeat-By:
	Try it.  Note that the modem will hang up as soon as the remote
	modem answers.
	
Fix:
	The change goes in the v3451_dialer routine.  The first thing
	it should do is:

		ioctl(FD, TIOCCDTR, 0);
		sleep(2);
		ioctl(FD, TIOCSDTR, 0);
