Subject: ``calendar'' command breaks when run on Fridays.
Index: usr.bin/calendar/calendar.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The calendar command produces no output when run on Friday
	because the egrep expression produced by /usr/lib/calendar
	(which matches dates belonging to any of the days: Friday
	- Monday) is too large for egrep to handle.

Repeat-By:
	On a Friday, create a file called ``calendar'' containing
	a line with the current date on it (as described in the
	manual) and run the command ``calendar''. You will see the
	message ``egrep: expression too large'' and the line
	with the current date (and any other lines) won't be printed.
