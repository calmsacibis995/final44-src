Subject: Find vs. symbolic links

Index:	usr.bin/find.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Find doesn't scan symbolic links if the are links to a directory
Repeat-By:
	Create a directory, and put an empty file in it. Create a
	symbolic link to that directory. Run 'find <directory> -print'
	on both the directory and the link, and note the difference.
