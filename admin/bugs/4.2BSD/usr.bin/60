Subject: Error in nroff tables.
Index: usr.bin/nroff/term/nec* 4.2BSD

Description:
	The nroff tables for nec 12-pitch printers are incorrect.
	The basic info. is correct, but plotoff should be ESC-]-J-ESC-
	]-W, not ESC-]-L-ESC-]-W as the tables tabnec12.c and tabnec-t.c
	have it. The effect was to switch the printer back to 10-pitch (the
	ESC-]-L) when switching back to non-plot mode.


Repeat-By:
	Try this on chapter 0 of the Franz Lisp manual:
	nroff -Tnec12 -rb3 -me ch0.r

Fix:
	Change L to J in the plotoff entry of tabnec12.c and tabnec-t.c.
