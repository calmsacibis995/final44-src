Subject: crypt and ed|ex|vi incompatibility
Index: usr.bin/crypt.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Having finally obtained the 84.2 Usenix bugtape, I've been
	working my way through the list one at a time in approximately
	alphabetical order installing bug fixes.  I'm now up to the
	letter g.  This morning the chief reported a problem with
	vi -x encryptedfile failing to decrypt the file.  When he
	tried the crypt command directly it successfully decrypted
	the file.  On experimentation I found that ed -x also failed.
	I checked the dates on crypt, ed, and ex and found that the
	latter two had been recompiled this month after I had installed
	some bug fixes whereas the first was dated September of last year.
	RECOMPILING CRYPT MADE ITS RESULTS COMPATIBLE WITH ED AND EX!
	I strongly suspect that the difference is due to some C compiler
	bug fix installed between September and now.
Repeat-By:
	Install the 84.2 bugtape fixes and cross your fingers.
Fix:
	Quickly move your executable copy of /usr/bin/crypt to
	a safe place.  Then recompile crypt, ed, and ex to make
	them all compatible.  Test the old and new encryption
	commands to see if there's a difference now and inform
	your users of the changes.

Description:
	Recently I reported having a problem with crypt not
	decrypting older files and speculated that it was due to a
	bug fix applied to the C compiler.  I was right ... I made
	a typo installing Ed Hall's int op= float fix to lib/ccom.
	I found it when tracking down a more recent, and obvious,
	bad compiler output.
Repeat-By:
	Install Ed Hall's fix but mistype the first line as

		if( o==CAST || (t != 2

	instead of 

		if( o==CAST || (t != t2
