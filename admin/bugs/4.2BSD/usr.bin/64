Subject: f77 drops .F source file pathnames for dbx
Index: usr.bin/f77 4.2BSD

Description:
	Aside from all the other problems with using dbx on fortran
	programs,  I found that dbx was unable to find the sources
	for executables compiled by f77 from fully qualified filenames
	ending with a .F suffix.  There is no problem (except one
	of flexibility) if the filename ends with the regular .f
	suffix.
Repeat-By:
	
	Running the shell script:

        #! /bin/csh
	mkdir f77test
	cd f77test
	cat >test.f << EOF
	k=1
	stop
	end
	EOF
	ln test.f test.F
	f77 -g test.f -o testf.x
	f77 -g test.F -o testF.x
	cd ..
	dbx f77test/testf.x << EOF
	list 1,3
	quit
	EOF
	dbx f77test/testF.x << EOF
	list 1,3
	quit
	EOF
