Subject: "at" uses double quotes instead of single quotes when setenv'ing
Index: 	usr.bin/at.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When you make a csh "at" script it places your environment
	variables on lines in the "at" script surrounded by double quotes.
	Now let us say you have something like:
	setenv EXINIT "map = $"
	Like our dumper did...
	Well...  $" is not a set C shell variable...
Repeat-By:
	Just:  setenv FOO '$'     in csh and then run "at"
Fix:
	I looked at the code...  It seems that if you are running a csh
	it makes it use double quotes instead of single quotes.  Why?
	If there is no real reason, all that has to be does is fix
	the line that does the puts double instead of single quotes.
