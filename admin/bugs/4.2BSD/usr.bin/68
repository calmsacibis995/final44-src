Subject: The at(1) man page appears incorrect.
Index: usr.bin/at/at.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The at man page doesn't mention the arguments available in 
	the at command.
Repeat-By:
	Look at the file at.c.  The following line is part of the 
	commentary at the beginning of the file.

		Synopsis:	at [-s] [-c] [-m] time [filename]
