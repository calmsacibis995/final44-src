Subject: spell inconsistency
Index: usr.bin/spell 4.2BSD

Description:
	Spell flags some words as incorrect, depending on whether they
	are in a file, or read from stdin.
Repeat-By:
	Put the word 'occured' in a file, say word.
	Then the command:
		spell word
	will output the following:
		occured
	While the command:
		spell < word
	causes no output !?!
