Subject: f77 compiler bug
Index: usr.bin/f77 4.2BSD

Description:
	In double precision, if you raise an expression x to a variable
	power y, and if the expression contains a power and at least
	another operation, then Fortran "may" return y**y instead of x**y.
Repeat-By:
	Compile and run following program in which both z and z2 should
	be identical.

c	implicit real*8 (a-z)
	data x/2.0d0/, y/3.0d0/
c
	z = (x**2.d0+1.d0)**(-y)
	anum = x**2.d0+1.d0
	power = -y
	z2 = anum**power
	print *,' x,y,anum,power,z,z2 =',x,y,anum,power,z,z2
	end
