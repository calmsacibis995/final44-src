Subject: The at daemon
Index: usr.bin/at/atrun.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	At doesn't set up group permissions correctly when it runs jobs.
Repeat-By:
	Create a directory, owned by someone else, that you have access to
	through it's group permissions.  Make it a group other than your
	login group.  Put a shell script in the file, cd into the directory 
	and execute the script.  Notice that it works.  Create an at job 
	that cd's to that directory and executes the shell script.  Queue it
	up and notice that it doesn't work.
Fix:
	I'm not sure if this is the "correct" fix.  What you want to 
	do is set it up so that at has access to all of a user's groups,
	rather than just the login group.  I fixed it by adding an
	initgroups() call in atrun.c.  The code segment is included below,
	just make sure you call initgroups before doing the setgid, while
	you're still root.

	/*
	 * Run the job as the owner of the jobfile
	 */
	initgroups(pwdbuf->pw_name,jobbuf.st_gid);
	setgid(jobbuf.st_gid);
	setuid(jobbuf.st_uid);
