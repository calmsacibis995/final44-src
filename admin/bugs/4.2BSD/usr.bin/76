Subject: DEBUG level 7 being used for too much
Index: usr.bin/uucp/pk1.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Running uucico with debug level 7 set is useful for monitoring
	the progress in connecting to a troublesome site, since it
	causes imsg.c to print out everything sent.  However, if you
	do get connected, then the debug level 7 messages in pk1.c
	really slow things down
Repeat-By:
	uucico -x7 to a site with lots in the queue.  Ugh!
Fix:
	Change all "DEBUG(7" to "DEBUG(8" in pk1.c
