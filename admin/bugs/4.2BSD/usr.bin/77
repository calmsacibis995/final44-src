Subject: tbl reference through NULL pointer
Index: usr.bin/tbl/tb5.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When there is no data for a given table line the internal
	table structure array contains a null (undefined) pointer
	for that line.  Subsequently there is a test to see if the 
	string pointer supposedly pointed to by the array pointer
	is zero.  On our VAX, fortunately, location 0 is invariably
	a valid program address containing a 0.  On our Convex, this
	is not the case and we get a core dump.

Repeat-By:
	tbl <s1 >s1.tbl

	where s1 is the text file

	.TS
	center;
	A C C C
	_ _ _ _
	A N N N.
	Algorithm	Sort	Combine	Total
				
	Cooley-Tukey	18	56	74
	CT/loop invert	18	17	35
	Gentleman-Sande	19	67	86
	Pease   	19	66	85
	Pease/long vec	19	8+13	40
	  '' + loop inv	7	8+13	28
	Stockham			66
	  '' + loop inv			20
	.TE

Fix:
	In tb5.c add 

	table[nlin] = alocv((ncol+2)*sizeof(table[0][0]));

	just prior to nlin++; in the if(nodata) clause.

	This appears shortly before the "real" table[nlin] = alocv()
	call.
