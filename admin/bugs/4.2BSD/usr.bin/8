Subject: '#' comments at front of 'sh' files
Index: 	usr.bin/struct 4.1c Fix

Description:
	Somebody put headers with version numbers in various shell
	files.  Unfortunately, the first character of these files
	should not be '#', as the c-shell will be invoked on them
	instead of the Bourne shell.

Repeat-By:
	Try /usr/bin/struct for an example of the c-shell trying to
	execute Bourne shell commands.  There are probably others, but
	I haven't gone out of my way to look for them.  I'm just
	passing this on from a user.

Fix:
	Put a blank line or a "#! /bin/sh" line at the front of these
	files.
