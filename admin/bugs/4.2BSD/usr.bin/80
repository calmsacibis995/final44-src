Subject: uucp vs. tip locking incompatibility
Index: usr.bin/tip/uucplock.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When the protection of /usr/spool/uucp is 755, as created by
	the "make mkdirs" of uucp, then tip cannot remove its own
	lock files because it has done a setuid(getuid()) between the
	locking and the unlocking.
Repeat-By:
	Just try it.  I see that our SUN workstations have the mode of
	/usr/spool/uucp set to 777, but is that secure enough for a
	large VAX system ??
Fix:
	I just set the mode to 777 for now, but I'm not happy about it.
	I think that the UNIX criterion for permission to delete files
	(write access to the directory) should be changed.  I would have
	the sticky, setuid, and setgid bits on the directory have some
	meaning.
