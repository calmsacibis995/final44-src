Subject: bug report
Index: usr.bin/tip/cmds.c 4.2BSD

Description:	Poor choice of FRAMESIZE (i.e. >BUFSIZ) causes
		1 of the tip processes to core dump when grabing
		a file from a remote machine.  Leaves tipout
		process still running and tty is weird state.

Repeat-by:	set FRAMSIZE to 2048 and ~take a file

Fix:		In cmds.c, procedure transfer(), line ~119 change

		if ((cnt = (p-buffer)) == number(value(FRAMESIZE))) {

		to be:

		if ((cnt = (p-buffer)) == number(value(FRAMESIZE))
		    || cnt == BUFSIZ) {
