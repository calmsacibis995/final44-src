Subject: bug report
Index: usr.bin/uucp/cico.c 4.2BSD

Description:	Uucp does not process signals properly
		because of the new 4.2bsd signal mechanism.
		Specifically, if uucp receives a signal
		(like SIGHUP when the phone line prematurely
		drops carrier), it loops indefinitely
		calling intrEXIT().

Repeat-by:	Starting up uucico and then doing "kill -4 <pid>"

Fix:		In cico.c, procedure intrEXIT(), add the following
		at the beginning of the procedure:

		#ifdef	SIGIO
			/* if using 4.2bsd signal mechanism,
				must unblock all signal handlers */
			sigsetmask(0);
		#endif
