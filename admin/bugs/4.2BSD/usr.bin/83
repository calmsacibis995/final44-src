Subject: bug report
Index: usr.bin/tip.c 4.2BSD

Description:	Tip doesn't detect loss of carrier.
		This can lead to dh silo overflow and
		loss of input characters for other ports.

Repeat-by:	tip'ing to a remote site and pulling plug
		on modem.

Fix:		File tip.c, procedure tipin(), line ~269,
		change:
			write(FD, &gch, 1);
		to:
			if (write(FD, &gch, 1) != 1)
				finish();	/* lost line */

		At line ~275 change:
			write(FD, &gch, 1);
		to:
			if (write(FD, &gch, 1) != 1)
				finish();	/* lost line */

		Then in file tipout.c, procedure tipout(),
		line ~95, change:
			if (cnt <= 0)
				continue;
		to:
			if (cnt <= 0) {
				fprintf(stderr, "\007lost carrier\r\n");
				exit(3);
			}
