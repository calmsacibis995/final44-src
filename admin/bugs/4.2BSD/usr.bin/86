Subject:  zero-value labels in prof -v
Index:    usr.bin/prof.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	prof generates labels for all global symbols when generating
	a plot, regardless of the setting of the "-z" flag.

Repeat-By:
	Running prof -v on a program that never calls a particular
	function; especially on a program with a very large number
	of global symbols.

Fix:
	Near line 586, after the range check for the value being
	plotted, add the commented lines:


	scale = (4080.*ransca)/(highpc-lowpc);
	lastx = 50.;
	for(np = nl; np<npe;  np++) {
		if(np->value < lowpc)
			continue;
		if(np->value >= highpc)
			continue;
/* ACT 1/1/83 */if (zflg == 0 && np->time == 0 && np->ncall == 0)
/* ACT 1/1/83 */	continue;
		time = np->time/totime;
		lasty = ranoff - (np->value - lowpc)*scale;


	so as not to print labels for zero-time symbols unless the
	-z flag is given.  While you're at it, fix the "old-fasioned
	assigment operator" errors.  There are three; two "=-" and one
	"=+".  Searching for =- and =+ will find just those.
