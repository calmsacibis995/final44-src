Subject: error in lint
Index: usr.bin/lint 4.1C

Description:
	lint fails to detect the use of an assignment statement
	which reduces to a constant as the conditional in an if
	statement.

	with the -h lint option, statements like
		if (1)
			foo();
	produce the warning "constant in conditional statement".
	unfortuantely, the statement if (a = 1) which is just
	as much a "constant" does not produce the warning.
	This is definitely a bug in lint, no question about it!

Repeat-By:
	lint -h file.c

		where file.c contains

	main()
	{
		int a;

		if (a = 1)
			x();
	}

Description:
	with the -h option, lint should issue a warning
	for if statements of the form
		if ( a = <simple expression> )
	where <simple expression> does not involve a function
	call.
	the intent is to permit lint to
	apply a heuristic which would catch the typical error
	of `=' used where `==' was intended, as in if ( a = b ).
	True, the statement is legal, but more often than not, it is
	NOT what was intended.  since the odds are greatly in
	favor of such a construct being in error, lint would
	be more helpful if it would issue a warning with the -h
	option which "attempts to intuit bugs".
	please notice that this is NOT an issue of style.
	on the contrary, lint would simply catch more errors
	and save much time and effort if it could flag this
	statement form under the -h option.

Repeat-By:
	lint -h file.c

		where file.c contains

	main()
	{
		int a, b=1;

		if (a = b) foo();
	}
