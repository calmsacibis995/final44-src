Description:

	According to the man page for lint, flag options can be concatenated
together (that is, "lint -ab file ..." works).  The shell script in
/usr/bin/lint uses a case statement to process flags.  However,
the command invocation
		lint -I/usr/joe/include ...
"breaks" the script.  The check for the "-n" option flag is made by
checking for "-*n*";  therefore, as a side-effect of specifying this
particular -I flag, the standard library compatibility checks are
disabled (resulting in large numbers of erroneous lint messages).

	A simple fix is to change the script from

		-*n*)	P= ;;
		-*p*)	P=port ;;
to
		-n)	P= ;;
		-p)	P=port ;;

which simply requires the use of "-n" or "-p" to occur separately
(which the shell script permits, anyway).
