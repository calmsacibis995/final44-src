Subject: addbib loops if abstracts are entered
Index: usr.bin/refer/addbib.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When the -a option is not used (abstract prompting), the addbib
	loops and repeats printing out the skeleton over and over after
        the ^d is entered to terminate output.
	Detailed description of the problem, suggestion, or complaint.
Repeat-By:
	Enter and addbib command to an empty file.  Enter 'n' to the
	prompt for instructions.  Enter anything for each of the fields.
	Enter one or two lines of abstract.  Enter ^d.  Program will start
	printing out the skeleton over and over.
Fix:
	add the following line: rewind(stdin);
	line 148 in addbib.c:

		if (abstract)
		{
			puts(" Abstract: (ctrl-d to end)");
			firstln = 1;
			while (fgets(line, BUFSIZ, stdin))
			{
				if (firstln && line[0] != '%')
				{
					fprintf(fp, "%%X ");
					firstln = 0;
				}
				fputs(line, fp);
			}
			rewind(stdin); /* clears loop grc 3/21/84 */
		}
		fflush(fp);	/* write to file at end of each cycle */
