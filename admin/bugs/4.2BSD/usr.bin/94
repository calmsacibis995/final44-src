      Charles,  Please pass this on to your system management:
  The real problem with nroff has to do with them calling ttyname() more
than once, and attempting to use the result of the earlier call after
the second one.  ttyname() returns a pointer to a static char *, of course;
the second call to ttyname() almost always returns Nil, which leaves the
static buffer initialized to "".  Then nroff re-enables messaging on the
terminal (it thinks) and ends up doing a chmod("", old-tty-mode).  Old-tty-mode
does not have any execute permissions.  Viola, current directory is clobbered.
The solution is to strcpy the first call to ttyname.

Repeat-By:
	Presumably nroff'ing to the terminal can cause the problem.
	Not sure about exact repeat circumstances, but this is a known
	problem of nroff at many installations. If may have been fixed here
	already.
Fix:
	See description above, which includes a fix (it is an obvious fix).
