Subject: iostat reports negative percentages
Index: usr.bin/iostat.c 4.2BSD

Description:
   After the system has been running a few days, a call to iostat results in
a report with a negative percentage in the ni column.  Here is an example:
 
     tty          ra0           ra1           ra2          cpu
 tin tout bps tps msps  bps tps msps  bps tps msps  us ni sy id
   3   43   9   3  0.0    0   0  0.0    0   0  0.0  44-47  6  0
Repeat-by:
   Only occurs after system is running for a few days.  Works ok right
   after reboot. If iostat is given interval argument, like iostat 10,
   first line is garbled as above, following lines are ok.
