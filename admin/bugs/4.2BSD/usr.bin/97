Subject: f77 driver specifies libs in the wrong order
Index: usr.bin/f77/src/f77/drivedefs.h 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Under some circumstances entry points required by routines
	in libU77.a are not found because they exist in earlier libs.

Repeat-By:
	I don't have a specific case in front of me, but it has been
	reported to me by several users.
Fix:
	The libraries are specified in the wrong order.
	Change drivedefs.h, as follows:
21c21
< 		{ "-lF77", "-lI77", "-lU77", "-lm", "-lc", NULL };
---
> 		{ "-lU77", "-lF77", "-lI77", "-lm", "-lc", NULL };
23c23
< 		{ "-lF77_p", "-lI77_p", "-lU77_p", "-lm_p", "-lc_p", NULL };
---
> 		{ "-lU77_p", "-lF77_p", "-lI77_p", "-lm_p", "-lc_p", NULL };
