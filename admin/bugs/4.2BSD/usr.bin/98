Subject: bug in find
Index: usr.bin/find.c 4.2BSD

sccsid = "@(#)find.c 4.7 	(Berkeley) 8/2/82 "

Description:
	I believe that find will not work when you attempt to find
	files from ABOVE a soft-linked directory.  I haven't looked 
	carefully at the code for find, but I tried two identical finds on
	(1) a real directory, and (2) a soft link to the same directory.
	Just ECHOing the filename worked for (1), but not
	for (2).  The find commands looked like:

Repeat-By:
	ln -s realdir softdir
	# works fine, slowly -- prints answers:
	find realdir \( -name '*.h' \) -newer datefile -echo {} \;
	# prints nothing, terminates quickly:
	find softdir \( -name '*.h' \) -newer datefile -echo {} \;

Fix:
