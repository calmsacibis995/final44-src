i wish to report a bug in some component of mail as currently
running on ucbvax.

i have learned to stop giggling at `Apparently-To:', and
to stop gagging at redundant `From' lines with inconsistent
addressing and at wholly unnecessary `Message-Id:' and
`Received:' lines.  i do not complain of them here.
nor do i complain about the idea of having a mailer
gratuitously attempt to add the sender's full name to
each message.  it's not that i don't think all of the
above unnecessary (or at best evidence of insufficient thought),
and for that matter rather opposed to the notions of simplicity
and cleanliness which are meant to underly unix.  but this is
really a matter of philosophy, for which there are probably
more appropriate forums.

however, i would like to point out that my name is not
`norman bookstein'.  i suggest that its presence in the (second)
`From' line in this message represents a bug.
