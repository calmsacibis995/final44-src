Subject: .UL in -ms
Index: usr.lib/tmac/tmac.s 4.2BSD

Description:
	The .UL macro in -ms doesn't function properly when used with
	nroff.  The problem is occurrs when you try and underline
	multiple words
Repeat-By:
	nroff -ms | ul the following
		.UL "Hello my fine friend"
	and get
		<SO>HELLO<SE>my
	where SO is "enter standout" and SE is "exit standout"
Fix:
	vi /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.s
	/de UL
	change	.if n .I \\$1 \\$2
	to	.if n .I "\\$1" "\\$2"

	P.S.  Why isn't source for macros in /usr/src/usr.lib/tmac?
