Subject: syslog setuid possibly in wrong place
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/aux/syslog.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	syslog does a setuid(1) (line 230) immediately before writing its pid 
	file usually in /etc somewhere.  this is bad because the pid file must
	then exist and be owned by uid 1 or uid 1 must be able to write in /etc.

Repeat-By:
	run it with /etc/syslog.pid owned by root with a mode of 755.

Fix:
	move the setuid(1) beyond the file write at about line 247.
