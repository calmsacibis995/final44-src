Subject: ~/.forward vs. /usr/lib/aliases
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/* 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	Prior to 4.2BSD, "sendmail" would prefer a user's .forward file
	over a /usr/lib/aliases entry.  This may be preferable in certain
	environments, but proves unnecessarily restrictive in others.  For
	example, if the person responsible for maintaining a protected
	aliases file is absent and a user has an entry which he wishes to
	temporarily override (perhaps to use the "vacation" program), he'd
	desire to be able to just create a .forward file and not have to
	hope to find someone who could modify the master aliases file.
	There are other examples, of course.
Repeat-By:
	Create a /usr/lib/aliases entry for a local user.  Create a .forward
	file for the same user.  The former is used.
Fix:
	Make this a configurable "sendmail" option!
