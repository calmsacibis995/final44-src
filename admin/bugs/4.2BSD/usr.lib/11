Subject: System lint library has incorrect template for gethostname()

Index:	usr.lib/lint/llib-lc 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
    The system lint library template contains an incorrect entry for
gethostname() at line 50:

int	gethostname( n, l ) char *n; int *l; { return 0 ;}

    The second argument is int, not int *. It would be worthwhile to
check for other incorrect templates while you're at it.

Repeat-By:
	Run lint on source containing a correct call to gethostname()

Fix:
	Change this line to:

int	gethostname( n, l ) char *n; int l; { return 0 ;}
