Subject: lprm doesn't work properly from gateway machines
Index: usr.lib/lpr 4.2BSD

Description:
	If you are on a host named "host-a" on network A, which is also
	attached to network B and known as "host-b" on network B, and
	the system the printer is on is attached to network B, lpr will
	spool files to the printer and say they came from "host-a".  If
	you then try to do lprm, the remote printer system will look up
	your Internet address and determine that your are on "host-b"
	and therefore won't let you remove the job because "host-a" !=
	"host-b", even though they are the same physical host.
Repeat-By:
	See above.
