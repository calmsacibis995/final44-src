Subject: sendmail installation bugs
Index: usr.lib/sendmail 4.2BSD

Description:
	After we installed sendmail we were getting messages complaining
	about unknown system name when mailing letters to each other.
	We looked around and changed the /usr/include/syslog.h file
	to reference our own system name rather than "localhost"
	and reinstalled.  Same results.  Finally we found that sendmail
	uses its own private copy of that file and the problem went
	away after repeating the change in /usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/include.
Repeat-By:
	Install the distributed sendmail program.
Fix:
	Do not distribute sendmail with private copies of system source
	codes.  Instances we find are:

	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/aux/newaliases.c
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/aux/rmail.c
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/aux/newsyslog
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/aux/syslog.c
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/doc/syslog.3
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/doc/syslog.8
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/include/syslog.h
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/include/sysexits.h
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/lib/newsyslog.sh
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/lib/syslog.c
