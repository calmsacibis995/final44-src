Subject: Setuid root doesn't work for lpc
Index: usr.lib/lpr/lpc.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	We set the mode on /etc/lpc to 4755 u=root g=staff but weren't
	allowed to disable the printer queues or daemons.
Repeat-By:
	chmod 4755 /etc/lpc
	/etc/lpc stop lp
Fix:
	Change all occurences of getuid() to geteuid() in lpc.c
