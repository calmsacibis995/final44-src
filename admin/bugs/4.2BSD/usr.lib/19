Subject:  /usr/lib/lib.b disappeared
Index: usr.lib/lib.b 4.1c Fix

Description:
	The bc library lib.b was missing from our 4.1c tape.
	I was bummed because I wanted to see if you had fixed
	a bug we found in 4.1a. In case you missed that one,
	here it is again:
	All calls to a(x) (except a(0)) return same value because
	in /usr/lib/lib.b:
	-----
	if(x==1)
		if(scale<52)
	return(.7853981633974483096156608458198757210492923498437764/1)
	-----
	should be:
	-----
	if(x==1) {
	    if(scale<52) {
		return(.7853981633974483096156608458198757210492923498437764/1)
	    }
	}
Repeat-By:
	N/A
Fix:
 	I retrieved it from our 4.1a system
