Subject: fortran signal routine not updated for new signal mechanism
Index: usr.lib/lib[FU]77/signal_.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	The user accessable signal handling mechanism provided in both
	libF77 and libU77 (source is identical except for sccsid) is
	for the old signal system, and does not allow access to signals
	from 16 to 27, and more importantly, does not pass on the
	additional fields now supplied, most importantly, the signal 
	code field which distinguishes betweeh the different types of
	floating point exceptions.
Repeat-By:
	Comparing the source code with the documentation.
Fix:
	Apply the following diff:
	
	diff /usr/src/usr.lib/libU77/signal_.c signal_.c
	26c26
	< static int (*dispatch[17])();
	---
	> static int (*dispatch[28])();
	39c39
	< 	if (*sigp < 0 || *sigp > 16)
	---
	> 	if (*sigp < 0 || *sigp > 27)
	56c56
	< sig_trap(sn)
	---
	> sig_trap(sn,code)
	57a58
	> int code;
	60c61,62
	< 	return((*dispatch[sn])(&lsn));
	---
	> 	long lcode = (long)code;
	> 	return((*dispatch[sn])(&lsn,&lcode));
