Subject: abort bug in FORTRAN library
Index: usr.lib/libI77/err.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	FORTRAN programs will not core dump after an error has been detected.

Repeat-By:

		program test
	C
		write (6, 10) i
		stop
	10	format (1^)
		end

Fix:

	err.c:
	#if	vax
		sigsetmask(0);
		signal(SIGILL, SIG_DFL);
	#else	pdp11
		signal(SIGIOT, SIG_DFL);
	#endif
		abort();
