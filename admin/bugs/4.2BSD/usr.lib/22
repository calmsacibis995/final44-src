Subject: read format bug in FORTRAN library
Index: usr.lib/libI77/rdfmt.c 4.2BSD

Description:

	Formatted read's with X's don't behave properly on truncated lines.

Repeat-By:
	Try the program below, and type in lines that are 3 characters
	long and those that are longer.  A 3 character line causes a
	F_EREREC error.  This format comes up when reading command files
	and some commands have no arguments.

	C	Exercise read from incomplete line bug

		program test
	C
		character*3 str
		integer int
		real float
	C
		read (5, 10) str, int, float
		print *, str
		stop
	10	format (a3,1x,i7,f8)
		end

Fix:

	This was our fix, it evidently causes another bug, but one that
	is rare and we can live with.

	rdfmt.c:
		case TR:
		case X:
			cursor += p->p1;
	#ifdef UCSFIGV
			tab = (p->op==TR); /* This voids '..,tl6,1x,..' sequences */
	#else
			tab = YES;
	#endif
