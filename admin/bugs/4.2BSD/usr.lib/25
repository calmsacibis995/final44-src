Subject: Sendmail can drop incoming mail from Berknet.
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/{deliver,srvrsmtp}.c  4.2BSD

Description:
	The mail connection between Berknet and sendmail can be flakey.
	Incoming mail may be lost.  Complaints from MAILER-DAEMON may or
	may not be generated.

	N.B. this problem is related but not identical to the `bug' fixed
	in version 4.21 (11/1/83) of /bin/mail.

Repeat-By:
	The following command should deliver the arbitrary message read from
	STDIN.  Instead, the message is neither accepted nor returned; there
	are vague complaints of "Bad usage" and the message is lost.
	    % /usr/lib/sendmail -v -T10-11 -oee -r <from> -h 1 <to>

Fix:
		----- /usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/deliver.c -----
