Subject: plot libraries have wrong names
Index: usr.lib/libplot 4.2BSD

Description:
	The plot libraries for 300, 300s, 450, and 4014 are named
	libt300.a, libt300s.a, etc. instead of lib300.a, etc.  The
	plot filters in /usr/src/usr.bin/plot use -l300, etc.
Fix:
	Change the Makefile, the directory names (t300 to 300, etc.)
	and the Makefiles in the directories to use the proper names.
