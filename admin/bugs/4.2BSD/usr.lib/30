Subject: Sendmail error/bug.
Index: usr.lib/sendmail 4.2BSD

Description:
	When sendmail is compiled and run, a Segmentation fault error occurs.
	By using DBX, I narrowed down to malloc() call.  It is the first call
	to malloc() when this error happens.  (NOTE: The libsys.a problem is
	already fixed.)
Repeat-By:
	/usr/lib/sendmail (one of the any options here)
	i.e. /usr/lib/sendmail -q
