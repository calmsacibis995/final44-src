Subject: atrun group permissions
Index: usr.lib/atrun.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When atrun is used to run a shell script created by at(1),
	it sets the uid and gid to that of the file ownership.
	Because initgroups(3X) is not used to set all the access
	groups that the original user had access to, the command
	can fail if you must belong to multiple groups to execute
	the "cd" or other commands.

Repeat-By:
	If you belong to multiple access groups and the directory
	you are in when executing at(1) is rwxrwx--- and the group
	is one which is in your access group, but not your "primary"
	group as determined by /etc/passwd, the at(1) command will
	run successfully.  However, when atrun is used to execute
	the command the will fail to be executed but no errors messages
	will be apparent.  The file created by at(1) will then be removed.
	This happens because the "cd" to the directory in which at(1)
	was orginally run will fail because atrun does not initial
	all the access groups from /etc/group.

Fix:
	Add the following 2 lines to atrun.c
