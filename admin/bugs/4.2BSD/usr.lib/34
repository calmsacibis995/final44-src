Subject: sendmail
	does not honor the values
	of QueueLA (x) and RefuseLA (X)
	in the frozen config-file.
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/conf.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Sendmail has two parameters which modify the delivery behaviour,
	that specified by the option ``d''.
	These are, QueueLA, option ``x'', the load average above which
	messages will be left in the queue for the daemon to deliver;
	and RefuseLA, option ``X'', the load average above
	which SMTP connections will be refused.
	These variables are statically initialized.
	Their values may be changed by command argument flags,
	or by options in the -.cf file.
	Because they are statically initialized,
	their values are not remembered in the ``frozen'' -.fc file.
	(Initialized static variables are allocated in .DATA,
	which is not saved in, nor loaded from, the -.fc.)

Repeat-By:
	Edit your sendmail.cf to contain suitably low values
	for these options, say
		Ox4
		OX6
	and make a new ``frozen'' config-file.
		/usr/lib/sendmail -bz
	(A) At a time when the load average is above,
	in this case, 4, send some mail, and observe that it
	is delivered, rather than being left in the Queue.
		- or -
	(B) At any time, kill the sendmail daemon
	with some core-generating signal, say 8,
	and inspect the wreckage:
	adb will show
		QueueLA/	8
		RefuseLA/	12
	the compiled-in default values.

Fix:
	Don't initialize the values of QueueLA and RefuseLA
	in their declaration in conf.c.
		- AND -
	Make sure you have the options
		Ox<number>
		OX<number>
	in your sendmail.cf file.  Otherwise zero will be used.

	If you want to be careful, (I am not being careful here.)
	you might change the only two uses of these variables
.../src/daemon.c:	while (getla () > RefuseLA)
.../src/deliver.c:	if (getla() > QueueLA)
	to behave gracefully for values <= 0.
	Choose your own conception of graceful behaviour.
