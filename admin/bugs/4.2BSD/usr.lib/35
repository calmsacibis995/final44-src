Subject: Time mark feature of syslog only works with -d option
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/aux/syslog.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The periodic time mark message that syslog (the daemon) is supposed to
	generate only gets generated when the daemon is invoked with the 
	debugging option, -d.
Repeat-By:
	Invoke the daemon as "/etc/syslog" and you get no time marks.
	Invoke it as "/etc/syslog -d" and you get time marks (and other
	stuff).
Fix:
	In regular - non-debugging - operation, the program forks, letting
	the parent exit(0) and the child become the daemon.  In debug
	mode, no fork is done.  The problem is that the initial call to
	alarm to set up the time mark is done before the fork, so in
	normal operation the SIGALRM is sent to the parent, which has exited.
	The child daemon never gets the first signal, so there are never
	any time marks.

	The fix is just to move the alarm call down after the fork.
	Doing "diff new old" yields:

	192a193,194
	> 	signal(SIGALRM, domark);
	> 	alarm(MarkIntvl*60);
	247,248d248
	< 	signal(SIGALRM, domark);
	< 	alarm(MarkIntvl*60);
