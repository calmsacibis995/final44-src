Subject: Truncated identifier clash.
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/savemail.c 4.2BSD
	usr.lib/sendmail/src/envelope.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When truncated to 8 characters,
	the identifiers ``returntosender'' and ``returnto''
	become identical.
Repeat-By:
	Fortunately this prevents the sendmail code
	from compiling on our PDPs.
Fix:
	Replace occurances of the identifier ``returntosender''
	by ``rtntosender'' in envelope.c and savemail.c.
