Subject: Missing subroutine.
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/headers.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The sendmail source provides a byte-moving subroutine called
	bmove.  Most of the sendmail code uses this.
	The 4.2BSD C library provides a byte-moving subroutine
	called bcopy.  Only code in headers.c invokes this.
	Our PDP C library does not have this subroutine.
Repeat-By:
	Try to make sendmail on a PDP without editing the source.
Fix:
	Change the line in headers.c from ..
	bcopy (mopts, h -> h_mflags, sizeof mopts);
.. to ..
	bmove (mopts, h -> h_mflags, sizeof mopts);
