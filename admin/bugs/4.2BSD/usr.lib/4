Subject: Bug in -me macros and tables with blocks (T{ }T)
Index: 	usr.lib/me/tbl.me 4.2BSD

Description:
	tbl is supposed to fill text in blocks (T{ }T pairs).  When
	you use the -me macros AND use any sort of floating keep, blocks
	in tables will no longer be filled.
Repeat-By:
	run the following through tbl | nroff -me:

.(z
This is a floating keep.  It will be diverted with .ev 1
.)z
.TS
n lw(2i).
1	T{
This is a rather long table entry, which should be broken
up into 2 inch wide lines.
T}
.TE

Fix:
	In file /usr/lib/me/src/tbl.me, always set fill mode after
	entering environment 1 through the @C 1 request:

*** tbl.me_dist	Thu Aug  5 14:44:40 1982
--- tbl.me	Fri Nov  2 15:14:37 1984
***************
*** 4,9
  .de TS			\" *** table start
  .sp \\n(bsu
  .@C 1
  .if "\\$1"H" \
  \{\
  .	di |h			\" save header part

+ .\"	This has an undesirable affect when you combine floating
+ .\"	keeps with tables that contain blocks - the blocks will not
+ .\"	be filled!  Counteract this by setting fill mode after entering
+ .\"	this environment.  tbl already takes care of emitting appropriate
+ .\"	nf requests for us.
