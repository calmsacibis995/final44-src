Subject: curses core dumps on terminals with less than 24 rows
Index: usr.lib/libcurses/refresh.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	In curses, there is an improperly terminated loop which seems
	to appear only on terminals with < 24 rows.
	It has been a couple of weeks since I fixed it; I have
	forgotten exactly *why* it occurs.
Repeat-By:
	run 'talk' on a  vt100 terminal with vt100-s TERM
	you will get a core dump;
Fix:
	Here is an rcsdiff:

< static char *rcsid = "$Header: refresh.c,v 2.1.1.1 84/04/11 03:46:01 root stab $";
---
> static char *rcsid = "$Header: refresh.c,v 2.1.1.2 84/04/29 21:54:56 root Exp $";
