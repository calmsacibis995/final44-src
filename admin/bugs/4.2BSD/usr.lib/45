Subject: ioinit(3F) doesn't work
Index: usr.lib/libI77 4.2BSD

Description:
	Fortran programs using "ioinit" won't load

Repeat-By:
	Call ioinit from a fortran program.  Watch it die.
Fix:
	run the command ar tv /usr/lib/libI77.a

	you will note that rather than ioinit.o, ioinit.f is
	included.

	recompile and re-archive libI77
