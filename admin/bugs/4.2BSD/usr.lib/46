Subject: No one escapes embedded 'From ' lines when appending to files

Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src/? 4.2BSD

Description:
	Sendmail was changed awhile ago to leave the escaping of
	'From ' lines to the local mailer.  Well, when it itself
	is the local mailer, as when going to files, I think it
	should do it.  At least somebody's got to, or sendmail should
	use a different message separating convention....

Repeat-By:
	Set up a mail alias to a 622 file, and mail the following to it:
sendmail -t
To: testfile

line one

From line three
line four
^D

Then do a Mail -f <filename> and get two messages.
