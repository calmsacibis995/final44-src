Subject: Problem encountered with the box macros in ms
Index: usr.lib/ms/s.tbl 4.2BSD

Description:
	In the version of the box macros (.B1 .B2) that we have in the
	ms macro package, with every box the indentation of the contents
	of the box and of the entire text shifts a little bit to the right.
Repeat-By:
	Put several box macros in a file using .B1 C , contents of box, .B2
	and see how the indentation shifts to the right.
Fix:
	In the definition of .B2, the line .nr BW +2*\\n(BI needs to be moved
	from where it was (after the .BB) to someplace earlier as shown below.
	I moved it to right after the .nf which solved the problem.
	The cause of the problem is that, in the way it was written,
	the amount that was indented and the amount that was then un-indented
	was not the same because the value of .BW changed between the
	indent and the un-indent requests.

.	\" B2 - end boxed text
