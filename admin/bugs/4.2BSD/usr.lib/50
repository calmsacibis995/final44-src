Subject: Multiply-defined _ospeed when using -lcurses -ltermcap
Index: usr.lib/libcurses/cr_tty.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Both the curses library and the termcap library have a global
	variable _ospeed; hence when both libraries are used, the ld
	loader gives this error message:

	_ospeed: ld:/usr/lib/libcurses.a(cr_tty.o): multiply defined

	   It appears that the intention was that curses' ospeed is for
	internal use only and should not have been global, whereas
	the ospeed in the termcap package is intentionally global.
Repeat-By:
	(This problem was discovered while loading the libraries via
	Franz Lisp, and I haven't come up with a simple demo of it
	elsewhere.  The fix below cured the problem, however.)
Fix:
	In cr_tty.c change ospeed to static, since it is for internal
	use only:

	    < short	ospeed = -1;
	    ---
	    > static short	ospeed = -1;
