Subject: lpd doesn't set NTTYDISC if xc or xs printcap is used
Index: usr.lib/lpr/printjob.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Although printcap supports "xc" and "xs" entries to clear
	or set local mode bits of a tty, this has no effect because
	the tty's line discipline is not set to the "new" discipline.
Repeat-By:
	Include an "xc" or "xs" entry in the /etc/printcap file for a
	printer connected via a tty line, then while a job is
	printing, do a "pstat -t" to observe that the DISC field is
	*not* "ntty", in which case the local mode settings are
	ignored (see tty(4)).
	Warning: Don't use an "stty > ..." command to check the
	settings; it will block while lpd is using the printer.
Fix:
	Add lines (marked with '+' below) to printjob.c to set
	line discipline if XC or XS is set:

  /*
   * setup tty lines.
   */
  static
  setty()
  {
  	struct sgttyb ttybuf;
  	register struct bauds *bp;
+ 	int ldisc = NTTYDISC;
	.
	.
	.
  	if (XC) {
+ 		if (ioctl(pfd, TIOCSETD, &ldisc) < 0) {
+ 			log("cannot set tty new line discipline");
+ 			exit(1);
+ 		}
	.
	.
	.
  	if (XS) {
+ 		if (ioctl(pfd, TIOCSETD, &ldisc) < 0) {
+ 			log("cannot set tty new line discipline");
+ 			exit(1);
+ 		}
	.
	.
	.
