Subject: E and D formats of Fortran I/O library 
Index: usr.lib/libI77.a 4.2BSD

Description:
	According to /usr/doc/f77/f77IO.ms, "a real value that is zero
        will display as 0. to distinguish it from a very small non-zero
        value. This occurs in F and G format conversions. This was not
        done for E and D since the embedded blanks in the external
        datum causes problems for other input systems." 
        It WAS done for E and D, causing problems for this and 
        other input systems.

Repeat-By:
	Compile and run the following Fortran program:
         -----------------------------        
         write(6,'(1pe12.3)') 0.,1.,2.
         stop
         end
         -----------------------------
        Output on Fuji@Stanford (4.2BSD) is
              0.   e+00
              1.000e+00
              2.000e+00

        If this is piped into:
          read(6,*) a,b,c
        a gets 0, b gets 0, c gets 1.
