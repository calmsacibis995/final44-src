Subject: sendmail can emit nonstandard "050 Warning: alias database out of
	date" messages on SMTP connections to non-sendmail sites
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/alias.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If the alias database is out of date, alias.c forces Verbose mode on
	while printing the above warning message, then sets it back to its
	previous state.  This has the effect of forcing the message to go
	out on the SMTP connection.  If the site at the other end of the SMTP
	connection is not running sendmail, the "050" code is meaningless to
	it and generally causes the mail transaction to fail.

Repeat-By:
	Touch your /usr/lib/aliases file without running newaliases, and make
	sure sendmail is not configured to update it automatically.  Then try 
	to send mail from a non-sendmail site and watch it get confused.

Fix:
	There seems to be absolutely no reason to force Verbose on in this
	situation, so I fixed the problem locally by removing the three lines
	of code in alias.c that do it.
