Subject: /usr/lib/lpd remembers indentation from one printout to the next.
Index: usr.lib/lpd/printjob.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	If a job is queued to a printer with a request that it be indented,
	subsequent printouts within the same queue run will be given the
	same indentation.

	The problem exists because the instantiation of /usr/lib/lpd which
	processes the queue doesn't reset all its variables after printing
	each job.  Specifically, it doesn't reset the indent amount to zero.

Repeat-By:
	Queue two files to a printer, asking that only the first be indented:
	  % lpr -i8 /tmp/foo; lpr /tmp/foo
	Note that BOTH printouts will be indented.

Fix:
	In the file usr.lib/lpd/printjob.c, find the function printit().
	Add the one new line shown below in context.

==========================================================================
	/*
         * Reset troff fonts.
         */
	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		strcpy(fonts[i], ifonts[i]);

ADD-->	strcpy(indent, "-i0");     /* BUG FIX - reset indent amount to zero */

	/*
	 *      read the control file for work to do
	 *	.....
	 */
