Subject: QS and QE macros missing from -ms
Index: usr.lib/tmac/tmac.s 4.2BSD

Description:
	The QS and QE macros mentioned in the guide to writing manuscripts
	with -ms aren't in the -ms package.
Repeat-By:
	grep for QS and/or QE in /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.s You won't find
	them.  For that matter they're not in any other macro package
	in that directory either.
Fix:
	Use lots of .QP's or .in+.ll's instead.
