Subject: Truly obscure bug in termcap
Index: usr.lib/termlib/termcap.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Programs which use termcap core dump under certain circumstances.  A
	termcap entry which contains a tc= field not terminated by a colon will
	occasionally result in a core dump.  Other less visible errors probably
	also occur.
Repeat-By:
	The program and script below will detect the bug 
========================================================================
/*	tcaptest.c
		detect obscure bug in Bill Joy's termcap
		(not Mark Horton's termlib)
*/
main()
{
	register int res;
	char tbuf[1024];
	int colon = ':';

	res = tgetent(tbuf, "bad");
	if(res != 1)
		printf("tgetent returns %d\n", res);
	if(colon != ':')
		printf("You've got the bug\n");
	else printf("No bug found here!\n");
}
/*	end of tcaptest.c */
:	Bourne shell script to test /etc/termcap reader routine
:	replace 'yourterm' by your favorite TERM value
:	I hear that some systems name the library 'termcap'
:		adjust the compile accordingly
cc -O -o tcaptest tcaptest.c -ltermlib
:	note that the test program will fail if TERMCAP has a terminal ':'
:	or begins with '/'.
TERMCAP='BD|bad:tc=yourterm'
TERM=bad
export TERM TERMCAP
tcaptest
:	end of script
========================================================================
Fix:
	Two solutions (I recommend both):
	1)	The following patch is from a 2.8bsd source.  The 4.2 source
		looks the same as far as I could see.

		*** termcap.c	Sat Sep 13 13:59:44 1980
		--- termcapa.c	Fri Nov  2 14:41:07 1984
		***************
		*** 134,140
  				return(1);
  			strcpy(tcname,p+3);
  			q = tcname;
		! 	while (q && *q != ':')
  				q++;
  			*q = 0;
  			if (++hopcount > MAXHOP) {

		--- 134,140 -----
  				return(1);
  			strcpy(tcname,p+3);
  			q = tcname;
		! 	while (*q && *q != ':')
  				q++;
  			*q = 0;
  			if (++hopcount > MAXHOP) {

	2)	The following command should make sure every line
		in /etc/termcap which contains a tc field ends with
		a colon.

		sed '/:tc=[^:]$/s/$/:/' /etc/termcap
