Subject: Font error in ditroff font
Index: usr.lib/font/ 4.2BSD

Description:
	The "square" charcter (\(sq) is a filled square in the font
	that comes with ditroff.  However, it is not a filled square
	in the manual (nroff user's manual).  This problem existed with the
	pre-ditroff vtroff also.
Repeat-By:
	Create an "nroff" file with \(sq chars in it and run it off on
	a versatec.  Viola!
Fix:
	Damned if I know.  I'm not a font person.  I suspect a little
	judicious use of a font editor would do it.
