Subject: aliases and smtp
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/srvrsmtp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	Sendmail 'normally' doesn't include the sender in alias expansion; this 
	feature is documented in the manual page.  'Normally' wasn't what I
	expected, but it was ok.  Smtp connections however never include the
	sender in alias expansions and even drop the sender from the recipient
	list.  The problem seemed to be that smtp recipients weren't treated
	the same as sendmail arguments; ie, weren't being tagged QPRIMARY.
Repeat-By:
	/usr/lib/sendmail -bs
	mail from:<root>
	rcpt to:<root>
	data
	test
	.
	quit
	Nothing is delivered to root.
Fix:
	Set the QPRIMARY flag for recipients in the CMDRCPT case
	in smpt() srvrsmtp.c
	RCS file: RCS/srvrsmtp.c,v
