Subject: Sendmail(8) dies with segmentation violation
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/usersmtp.c 4.2BSD (Fix)

Description:
	Sendmail(8), when trying to process an SMTP error that
	has occured during initialization, dies of a segmentation
	violation.  This is caused by an incorrect number of
	arguments being passed to the routine "smtpquit".

Repeat-By:
	Hard to reproduce, since it depends on what's on the stack. 
	In our case, it happened on machines with a combination
	of heavy mail traffic and chronic Ethernet problems.
Fix:
	Apply the following diffs to correct the problem:
	(I don't have SCCS, so the output is from RCS)

	RCS file: RCS/usersmtp.c,v
	diff  -r1.1 -r1.2

	> 	smtpquit(pvp[0], m);
