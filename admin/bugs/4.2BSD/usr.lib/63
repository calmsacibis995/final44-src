Subject: ``atrun'' fails on calder
Index: usr.lib/atrun 4.2BSD

Description:
	``at'' builds a script just fine (if you give the script to
	``sh'' it runs).  ``atrun'' is run by ``/etc/cron'' every
	15 minutes.  ``/usr/spool/at/lasttimedone'' is updated
	and the script is removed if it is time to run it.  However,
	the results of the script never appear (hard to tell if
	it even started to run).
Repeat-By:
	% ls
	x	y	z
	% at 1100
	echo this is a test > attest
	^D
	%

	   .
	   .
	( later, after 11:00 )
	   .
	   .
	% ls
	x	y	z
	%
