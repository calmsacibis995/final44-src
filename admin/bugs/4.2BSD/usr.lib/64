Subject: `Clever' ascii i/o sucks.
Index: usr.lib/libI77.o 4.2BSD

Description:
	According to /usr/doc/f77/f77io.ms, 
	" On output, a real value that is truly zero will display
	as  ``0.''  to  distinguish  it  from  a very small non-zero
	value.  This occurs in F and G format conversions.  This was
	not done for E and D since the embedded blanks in the exter-
	nal datum causes problems for other input systems."

	Yes it WAS done for E and D formats, and indeed this causes
	problems both for this and for other input systems.

	As a matter of style, this kind of format decision should be
	left in the programmer's hands, not built into the library in 
	a way that cannot be bypassed.

Repeat-By:
	Create and compile the following lines:
	      write(6,'(1pe12.5)') 0.0,1.0
	      stop
	      end
	Run a.out to get :
	     0.     e+00
	     1.00000e+00
Fix:
	Filter f77 ascii output with a sed script before passing
	to another program.
