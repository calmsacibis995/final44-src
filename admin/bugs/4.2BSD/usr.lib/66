Subject: Unreasonable result from the math library.
Index: usr.lib/libnm 4.2BSD

Description:
	exp(-x) = -infinity    for large positive x

	This is presumably a `feature', not a `bug'.  The mathematical
	functions are supposed to return an `impossible' value for
	arguments outside their range.  However 0 is also an impossible
	value for exp(x) - and it is a much better approximation to the
	true value of exp(x) for arguments in that range.

Repeat-By:
	Create the file dumb.f:
	      write(6,'(1pe12.5)') exp(-200.)
	      stop
	      end
	Compile 
		f77 dumb.f -lnm  
	and run a.out, giving...
		-1.70000e+38
Fix:
	Replace the 
	    movd huge, r0
	with 
	    clrd r0
	in /src/usr.lib/libnm/exp.s
