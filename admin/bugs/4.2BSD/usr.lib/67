Subject: Not a bug - request for documentation
Index: usr.lib/tmac.s 4.2BSD

Description: 
	It appears that /usr/lib/tmac.s has been stripped of comments.
        Is it possible to get the unstripped version? In particular,
        I would like to try to fix some problems regarding .MC output
        mixed with eqn source.
        P.S. Is there a `right' address for requests as distinct from
        bugs?
        -Thanks.
