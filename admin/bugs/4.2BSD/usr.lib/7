Subject: lint -lc library mistake
Index: 	usr.lib/lint/llib-lc 4.2BSD

Description:
	printf() and scanf() have a variable # of arguments, but
	have a minimum of one.  Similarly, fprintf(), sprintf(),
	fscanf(), and sscanf() have a minimum of two arguments.
	The llib-lc file states they are VARARGS, though, which
	is incorrect.

Repeat-By:
	Look at llib-lc

Fix:
	Change VARARGS to VARARGS1 before printf() and scanf(),
	and VARARGS2 before [fs]printf() and [fs]scanf().
