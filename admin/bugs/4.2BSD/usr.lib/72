Subject: fgetc_ and getc_ strip the parity bit.

Description:
	fgetc and getc strip the parity bit.  This is wrong for two reasons:
	(1) it is unnecessary if the file is a character device because the
	tty driver strips the parity bit when in cooked mode - if the device
	is in raw mode you want all eight bits; and (2) you lose the ability
	to read 8 bit data files.

Repeat-By:
	Do a fgetc (or getc) from fortran on a file with 8 bit data and
	notice that the 8th bit is always 0.

Fix:

	40c40
	< 	*c = i & 0177;
	---
	> 	*c = i;
