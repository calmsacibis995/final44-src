Subject: user address in (mailer, host, user) tuple not rewritten correctly
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/parseaddr.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When an address is resolved to a mailer, the user part of the
	(mailer, host, user) tuple is not rewritten according to the
	mailer's recipient address rules.

Repeat-By:
	Generate the uucp tuple as (uucp, host, user@host.UUCP); one
	can write the uucp mailer rules to correctly translate user@host.UUCP
	to host!user, but sendmail will still hand off user@host.UUCP as the
	user argument to uux/rmail.  A mailer's rewriting rules are there to
	rewrite addresses to conform to the mailer's idea of what should be
	legal, and in this case they simply are not being called.

Fix:
	RCS file: RCS/parseaddr.c,v
	retrieving revision 1.4
	diff -c -r1.4 parseaddr.c
