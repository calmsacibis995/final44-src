Description:
	sendmail refuses to rebuild the alias database files
	when it can't find  its completion cookie (@:@).
Repeat-By:
	Trash the /usr/lib/aliases.dir file
		(cp /dev/null /usr/lib/aliases.dir)
	Sendmail will not notice this, because it looks
	only at the /usr/lib/aliases{,.pag} files.
	The function initaliases () will wait 5 minutes
	for aliaslookup ("@") to succeed, and then procceed;
	Because atcnt has decremented past 0, the expression..
	stb. st_ino = 0;
	if (! init && (atcnt < 0 || stat (buf, & stb) < 0 || stb. st_mtime < modtime))
	{
	.. will be true immediately without calling stat ();
	so the following expression will always be false..
		errno = 0;
		if (AutoRebuild && stb. st_ino != 0 &&
				((stb. st_mode & 0777) == 0666 || stb. st_uid == geteuid ()))
		{
			...
Fix:
	Try rearranging the order of evaluation..
	stb. st_ino = 0;
	if (! init && (stat (buf, & stb) < 0 || stb. st_mtime < modtime || atcnt < 0 ))
	{
		...
