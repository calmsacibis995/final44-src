Subject: Re: user part of (mailer, host, user) tuple not be rewritten
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/parseaddr.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	The bug I sent a few days ago had a bug in it.  The first rewrite
	should be with rule set 2 instead of rule set 1.

Fix:
	The complete bug fix:
	
	RCS file: RCS/parseaddr.c,v
	diff  -r1.4 parseaddr.c
	904c904,908
	< 	rewrite(++tv, 4);
	---
	> 	/* rewrite "rcpt to" address according to mailer recipient rule */
	> 	rewrite(++tv, 2);
	> 	if (m->m_r_rwset > 0)
	> 		rewrite(tv, m->m_r_rwset);
	> 	rewrite(tv, 4);
