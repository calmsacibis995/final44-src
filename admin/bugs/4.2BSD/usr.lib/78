Subject: sendmail can return 2 error messages when in SMTP mode
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/envelope.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When sendmail gets a garbaged address when running as a SMTP
	deamon, it returns 2 error messages. RFC821 clearly says that
	only one error message may be returned. If two are returned the
	remote end gets out of sync.

Fix:
	Apply this diff to envelope.c to eliminate the second message:
	***************
	*** 673,679
		pvp = prescan(from, '\0');
		if (pvp == NULL)
		{
	- 		syserr("cannot prescan from (%s)", from);
			finis();
		}
		rewrite(pvp, 3);

	--- 673,678 -----
		pvp = prescan(from, '\0');
		if (pvp == NULL)
		{
			finis();
		}
		rewrite(pvp, 3);
