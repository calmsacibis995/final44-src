Subject: misleading error message in dbm
Index: usr.lib/libdbm/dbm.c 4.2BSD Fix

Description:
	The dbm procedure can print the error message "bad block."
	I know someone who spent 3 hours looking for a bad block
	in his filesystem before realizing that the mesages was 
	coming from a dbm routine.
Repeat-By:
	Mung /usr/lib/aliases.* and try to send mail.
Fix:
	Near the end of the file, change the line
	printf("bad block\n");
	to read
	printf("dbm chkblk: bad block\n");
