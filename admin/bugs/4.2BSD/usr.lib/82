Subject: Infinite tc= Loop
Index: usr.lib/termcap.c 4.2BSD

Description:

	The vaiarble `hopcount' is used to detect infinite loops
	created by the `tc=' capability. Because it is never reset,
	there is a limitation on the number of times `tgetent' may be
	called.  This is probably a feature, not a bug. It depends on
	how the termcap routines were intended to be used.

Repeat-By:

	Go into `ex', type `set term=<any term which ends in "tc=">'
	lots of times, you will get the message:
		`Infinite tc= loop'

Fix:

	In the routine `tnchktc', change all of the lines containing
		return(#);	to	return(hopcount = #);
	where # is either zero or one.
