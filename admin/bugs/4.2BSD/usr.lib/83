Subject: Curses and inverse mode
Index: usr.lib/libcurses/refresh.c 4.2BSD && 4.3BSD

Description:
	When curses issues the SO string to get into inverse mode on
	a refresh, it ignores the fact that there are some terminals
	which give extra spaces when you do this. I think it would be
	good if it were to pay attention to the :sg#: entry in the termcap
	and act accordingly.
Fix:
	Backspace SG number of times?
