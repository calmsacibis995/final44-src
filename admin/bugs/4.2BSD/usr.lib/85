Subject: sendmail turns _ in login names into a space
Newsgroups: net.bugs.4bsd,net.unix-wizards
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/recipient.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	We have login names for our uucp neighbours of the form u_host
	(e.g. u_utzoo).  sendmail thinks underscores should be turned
	into spaces before looking up login names in the password file
	and consequently never found such login names.  We had dueling
	sendmails when one machine's uux (running under a u_host login
	name) mailed an error message to another machine's u_host login.
Repeat-By:
	Create a u_ucbvax login.  Try to send mail to it.
	Watch sendmail say "u_ucbvax ... User unknown".
Fix:
	This fix makes sendmail leave underscores alone.  (Eric, get away
	from that airplane glue!)
