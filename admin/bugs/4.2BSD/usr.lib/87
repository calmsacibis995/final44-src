Subject: Shell scripts run by 'at' ignore group memberships
Index: usr.lib/atrun  4.2BSD

Description:
	Berkeley UNIX allows a user to be a member of several groups simultaneously.
	However, shell scripts invoked via the 'at' command do not enjoy this
	privilege.  At execution time, they have membership in a small
    (and sometimes surprising) set of groups.  This is a bug in /usr/lib/atrun.

Repeat-By:
	Run the following script, specifying a time in the near future.
	(Or create a /tmp file with a gid in which you have membership
	as assigned by the /etc/group file; run a simple 'at' command which
    attempts to write to this file.)

	#! /bin/sh
	# Usage: grouptest TIME
	# where TIME is in the format understood by the 'at' command.
	at $* << 'EoF'
	(echo -n "This script put me in groups "; groups) >/dev/console
	(echo -n "User $USER is really in groups "; groups $USER) >/dev/console
	'EoF'

	On my computer, the result is:
		This script put me in groups operator tc
		User jeff is really in groups hiero unixsrc swsup news tc staff

Fix:
	/usr/lib/atrun should do an initgroups().
