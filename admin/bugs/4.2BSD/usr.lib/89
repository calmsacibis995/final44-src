Subject: sendmail's accessing the alias database
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/srvrsmtp.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	We noticed that aliases were not being expanded on mail coming
	into the smtp server.  Locally generated mail was aliases correctly
	thus the vast majority of aliases worked correctly since sendmail
	delivers to a userid even if it cannot find it in the alias table.
	Also, our relay machine, which is running 4.1, had an older version
	of sendmail running, so aliases which came in from outside of our
	domain were handled correctly. It was only those aliases specific
	to our 4.2 machine that failed.
Repeat-By:
	Try sending mail to 'postmaster@hostA' from hostB, given that
	postmaster is an alias which is known on hostA, and that hostA
	and hostB communicate via an smtp connection and sendmail is
	running as daemon on hostA.
Fix:
	I removed the initalias(AliasFile, FALSE) function call
	in the function 'runinchild' which can be found in srvrsmtp.c,
	and replaced it by the same function call at the first of the smtp function in srvrsmtp.c (i.e. before the inifinte loop.
	If you don't know the fix, don't include this section or "Fix:".
