Subject: -me source lives in bizarre place
Index: 	usr.lib/me/source/... 4.2BSD

Description:
	Finding the commented of sources for -me macros is impossible.
	They live in a very bizarre place.  They should live in something
	like /usr/src/usr.lib/me or /usr/src/usr.lib/tmac/tmac.e (probably
	the former, since this is where the real -me macros live on line.
Repeat-By:
	N.A.
Fix:
	su
	mv /usr/lib/me/src /usr/src/usr.lib/me
	exit
