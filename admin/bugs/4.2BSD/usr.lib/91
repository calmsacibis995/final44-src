Subject: f77 external formatted read
Index: usr.lib/libI77/sfe.c	4.2BSD

Description:
	(Original description, submitted 26 Oct 83, by gregc@ucsfcgl.UUCP)
	"Formatted read's with X's don't behave properly on truncated lines."

	Actually, the format execution IS correct. However, the I/O system
	should be tolerant and allow short records, particularly if a human
	is typing data. Therefore, the "1x" below should not cause an error.
		
Repeat-By:

	Try the program below, and type in lines that are 3 characters
	long and those that are longer.  A 3 character line causes a
	F_EREREC error.

	C
	C	Exercise read from incomplete line bug
	C
		program test
	C
		character*3 str
		integer int
		real float
	C
		read (5, 10) str, int, float
		print *, str
		stop
	10	format (a3,1x,i7,f8)
		end

Fix:
	The original fix proposed introduces other bugs as side effects.

	The fix below works only for sequential external reads from a
	device that can't seek, e.g. a terminal port. The more general
	fix requires major restructuring of the I/O code.
	I've delta'ed this into the source code on UcbMonet.
