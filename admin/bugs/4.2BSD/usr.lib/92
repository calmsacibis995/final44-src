Subject: lpd bombs out with long job names
Index: usr.lib/lpr/printjob.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	lpd will die silently occasionally. Upon putting debugging info
	into it, we found that the fields used to store items like
	fromhost, logname, jobname, class, title were (a) woefully short,
	(b) not checked for bounds overflow.
Repeat-By:
	lpr -Panyone -Janythingatallthatsover32characters anything
Fix:
	increase size of those fields; use strncpy(class, line+1, sizeof
	class-1); instead of strcpy.
