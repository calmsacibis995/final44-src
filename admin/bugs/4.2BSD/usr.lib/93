Subject: Bug in 4.2BSD curses screen refresh of wide screens
Index: usr.lib/libcurses/refresh.c 4.2BSD

Description:
	When using a termcap with a large number of columns (e.g. 132
	instead of 80) wrefresh() of the curses package will sometimes
	try to update beyond the end of it's screen if the old and new
	screens are very similar.  A good example is starting up talk.
	The problem is that the makech() procedure in refresh.c does
	not check to see if it ran off the end of its window in one
	case.

Repeat-By:
	Use a termcap with a large number of columns (132 column mode
	is what I used).  Run 'talk'.  A 'segment violation' should be
	produced.

Fix:
	Add the second comparison in the while loop to check for
	the last column character.  A diff is provided below,
	please ignore the line numbers.
