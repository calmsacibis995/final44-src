Subject: Problem with lpr -l
Subject: lpr/spooler problem
Index: usr.lib/lpr/lpd.c 4.2BSD

Description:

The -l switch to lpr doesn't seem to work.  If you use it, the spooler entry
does have a "card" beginning with the letter 'l', as it should, but thereafter,
lpf is run without the '-c' switch, which is what I thought should be the
desired effect, leading to control characters being passed.  I don't know 
whether this is an lpd problem or perhaps a /etc/printcap problem?
