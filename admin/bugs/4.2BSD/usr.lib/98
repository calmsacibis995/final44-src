Subject: Bug with list directed internal read
Index: usr.lib/libI77/iio.c 4.2BSD [Fix]

Description:
	List directed read consumed bytes until it finds a datum
	or a separator. Internal read's getc returned ' ' if asked
	for bytes beyond the end of the array. This caused list
	directed read to loop forever.

Repeat By:
		program junk
		character*5 blank
		blank = "     "
		read(blank,*) n
		end

Fix:
	The following changes have been made to usr.lib/libI77/iio.c
	on Monet:

2c2
< char id_iio[] = "@(#)iio.c	1.3";
---
> char id_iio[] = "@(#)iio.c	1.4";
20a21,24
> 	if(formatted == LISTDIRECTED)
> 	{	leof = EOF;
> 		return(EOF);
> 	}
