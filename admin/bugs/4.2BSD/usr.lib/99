Subject: Sendmail breaks mail with header-lines longer than 2500 bytes.

From: A San-Franciscan (well, Bostonian actually) for Responsible Anarchy <rhc@ucbopal.CC>

Description:
	collect (collect.c) and readqf (queue.c) both
	attempt to read an entire folded header-line
	into a buffer before dealing with any part of the line.
	As distributed, the buffer is 2500 bytes long.
	There are messages out there in which a politely folded
	recipient-header-line (eg, to-line or cc-line)
	totals more than 10K bytes.
	Sendmail stops collecting header when such a line
	overflows its buffer; the rest of the header
	becomes the beginning of the body of the message.
Repeat-By:
	Feed sendmail a message with such a large
	folded header-line.
	If you would like a copy of an actual message
	with 10K bytes of recipient addresses,
	let me know: I will send you one.
Fix:
	We are now running with MAXFIELD (conf.h) defined as 25000,
	(except on our PDPp, where for lack of space it remains 2500).
	This is not a fix; this is a kludge.
Suggestion:
	I would suggest eating the addresses one at a time,
	in a manner similar to that used by MH.
