Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD-reno

At the csh prompt, type

 `yes`

The shell will report that there are too many arguments from `` and
then go to tumbolia, never to return.  It still has most signals
blocked/ignored (INT, TERM, etc).  Sending it a SICGHLD doesn't make
it come back, but it will go away on a HUP like usual.
