Subject: need IEEE floating point algorithm
Index: lib 4.3BSD-reno

I was looking through the UNIX source and spotted the notes on IEEE
floating point code provided by K.C. Ng, with Z-S. Alex Liu, S. McDonald,
P. Tang, and W. Kahan.  The comments said that I should report my
experiences (good or bad) with the elementary function codes.

My only experience is bad because I'm trying to find an algorithm that
is not part of the supplied IEEE library.

What I am looking for is an algorithm that will convert a number in
IEEE floating point binary into an ASCII string suitable for displaying
to user.  I would also like the reverse algorithm, ASCII to binary.  I
require that the algorithm not depend on having an IEEE floating point
unit available to implement the algorithm.

I would prefer that the algorithm have these attributes:

   1) accuracy.  I would prefer if the conversion to ASCII would
   deliver a string that would convert exactly back to the binary
   when converted the other way.

   2) not use unusually large amounts of memory or time.

   3) be able to handle 32-bit, 64-bit, and 80-bit formats supported
	  by common available microprocessors.

My application is a cross debugger.  It is hosted on many platforms,
some of which do have IEEE floating point (Sun3, Sun4, DEC-RISC, IBM
RS/6000 (i think)) and one that does not (VAX).  The targets of
the cross debugger are 680x0 with 68881/68882, 386/486 with a 387,
MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Motorola 88K.

The current algorithms the debugger is using to display floating point
numbers are not accurate enough for some users, so I'm trying to find
an algorithm that will make these users happy.  Any help you can provide
me would be appreciated.

PS: Say hello to Prof Kahan.  I doubt if he remembers me, I met him a few
times when he was consulting with John Palmer at Intel on the 8087.  At
the time (1977-78) I was a young bald guy.  Now I'm an older bald guy.
