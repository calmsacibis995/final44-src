Subject: The generic kernel doesn't find our KDA50 disk controllers.
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The generic kernel doesn't find our KDA50 disk controllers.

Repeat-By:
	The machines are tinyvax-3200's, each with a KDA50 driving
	an RA60 and some RA81's, and some other goodies. Autoconfig
	does show up the other goodies.
