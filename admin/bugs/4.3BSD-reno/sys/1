Subject: VAX kernel source not entirely under /sys directory
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs

Description:
	/sys/vax/asnumber.h is a symbolic link to
	/usr/src/pgrm/as.vax/asnumber.  If working on a small disk
	and have only restored the /sys directory tree, this link
	doesn't resolve and the kernel build fails.

Fix:
	Move the actual file into /sys/vax and make
	/usr/src/pgrm/as.vax/asnumber.h be a symbolic link to the
	file under /sys.
