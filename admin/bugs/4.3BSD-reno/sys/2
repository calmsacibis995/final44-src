Subject: TS11 tape controller not recognised by system during autoconfig
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs

Description:
	The vaxuba/ts.c driver doesn't get our tc12 tape controller to
	interrupt and the tape drive is therefore unavailable to the
	system.  As this happens when the mini-root boots, we are unable to
	complete the installation as documented.
Repeat-By:
	I believe this is hardware dependent.  The original 4.3bsd version
	of the ts11 driver assumed that the device was present if it was
	configured into the kernel.
Fix:
	Apply the context diff below to sys/vaxuba/ts.c
