Subject: Various "errno" values are overloaded
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If you try to overwrite the label sector on a disk, various
	4.3-reno (and 4.3-tahoe) drivers return EROFS.  At least one
	user has been confused by this on a 4.3-tahoe system.

	The "mt" tape driver returns ENOMEM if you try to read a block
	from the tape but the block is longer than the count you gave to
	"read()".  (Other drivers don't even bother checking for this,
	which is Not Very Good of them.)

	The mount code for the BSD file system returns EINVAL if the
	super block has a bad magic number or an out-of-range block
	size; the manual page for "mount()" even lists this in the BUGS
	section.
Repeat-By:
	Obvious.
Fix:
	Invent new "errno"s, stick them in "sys/errno.h", add reasonable
	error messages to "sys_errlist[]", and make the kernel code in
	question use them.

	(And while you're at it, make the *OTHER* mag tape drivers check
	for a record that's too long and return the code for that error.)
