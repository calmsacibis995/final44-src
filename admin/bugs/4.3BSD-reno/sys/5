Subject: connect() to address that returns ICMP TTL exceeded causes crash
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When traceroute, telnet, sendmail, etc attempts to connect() to
	an IP address that results an a ICMP TTL exceeded message, the
	system will either crash (free: multiple frees) if root, or hang
	if not root.
Repeat-By:
	It was first noted when sendmail tried to deliver to the address
	root@[131.230.135.95].  Due to a router configuration problem
	at SIU, the packet bounces back and forth between routers and
	eventually times out.  When the ICMP message is received, the
	system folds up.  Try "traceroute 131.230.135.95" as root.
