Subject: Strange swap problems on 4.3bsd Reno on a VAX
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	We're running 4.3 (reno) on 3 Vax 8650's with several Emulex
	massbus controllers (SC7003).  After some period of time, an
	application which is cached will start dying with "Illegal
	Instruction" or some other error.  "touch"ing the file will often
	fix this problem -- sometimes we need to reinstall the program.
	Our hypothesis is that there is some problem in the swap code --
	has anyone reported any similar problems?  Is there a fix?
	
Repeat-By:
	Run on a heavily loaded system for awhile.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice ...
