Subject: ICMP host redirects crash system
Index: sys 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When two or more ICMP host redirects are received in succession,
	the kernel panics with free: multiple frees error.
Repeat-By:
	Arrange for multiple ICMP host re-directs to hit the system in
	a short period of time.  traceroute -g is good for this.
