Subject: more breaks boldface/underline lines too soon
Index: usr.bin/more/line.c 4.3BSD-reno +FIX
Date: Thu, 23 Aug 90 02:36:32 PDT
From: Craig Leres <leres@helios.ee.lbl.gov>

Description:
	The column pointer is incorrectly gains one for each boldface
	or underlined word found in a line. This causes such lines to
	be broken too soon.

	There is also a bug when a boldface word crosses the display
	boundry. I don't see how to fix it without doing read ahead,
	though.

Repeat-By:
	Construct a file with a single line that repeats the string
	"f\bfo\boo\bo " 19 times and run more on it. Notice that more
	breaks the line even though it fits on a 80 column display.

Fix:
	Fix column update math.
