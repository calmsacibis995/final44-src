Subject: passwd(1) broken if compiled without kerberos
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD-reno
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs


Description:
	When the passwd program is compiled without the Kerberos option
	defined (as in the distributed binaries!), the values of argc and
	argv are out by 1.  The program attempts to look for the user name
	in argv[0] instead of argv[1]
Repeat-By:
	Run the passwd program as distributed on a system where there is
	no user called "passwd".
Fix:
	Apply the following context diff to passwd/passwd.c

*** passwd.c.reno	Mon Feb 24 15:27:39 1992
--- passwd.c.working	Mon May 13 16:24:45 1991
