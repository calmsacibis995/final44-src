Subject: diff -r reports similarities
Index: bin/diff/diffdir.c 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Running diff -r produces `Common subdirectories: dir and .../dir'
	messages.  This is a statement of similarity, not difference.

Repeat-By:
	% diff -r /usr/src/bin/diff /usr/src/bin/diff

Fix:
*** /usr/src/bin/diff/diffdir.c	Thu Oct 22 10:04:28 1987
--- diff/diffdir.c	Wed Oct  5 15:09:52 1988
