Subject: using "expr(1)" in file spec manipulation
Index: bin/expr 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	A problem occurs when using "expr(1)" in file spec manipulation
	problems.  Take for example:

		expr $a : /*\(/.*\)	# Strip multiple leading "/"

	If $a resolves to "/", then expr(1) assumes that the / is a division
	operator and bombs with a "syntax error".  I assume that the same
	thing will occur for any operator recognized by expr(1).

Repeat-By:
	See above.
