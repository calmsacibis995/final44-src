Subject: C compiler error "cannot reclaim" caused by complex "if" expression.
Index: bin 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	A complex expression in the conditional of an "if" statement confuses
	the C compiler.  If this conditional is split into two statements
	(assign expression to a temporary, and use the temporary in the "if"),
	the code compiles properly.  See the code below for a specific example.

Repeat-By:
/*   This program is a minimal fragment from a larger program that
     illustrates an alleged C compiler bug.  If I split up the
     errant IF statement, by simplifying the expression it evaluates,
     the routine compiles properly.  The use of #define is irrelevant,
     as the error occurs when I hand-expand the expression also.
     
     Compile this program with
	     "cc -c <name>.c"

     The bug manifests itself with the message:

	"<name>.c", line xx: compiler error: cannot reclaim

    [This code fragment originally appeared in Larry Wall's "perl 2.0",
     in the file "eval.c".]
*/
typedef struct string STR;

struct string {
    double	str_nval;
    STR        *str_next;
    char	str_nok;
};

double str_2num();
STR *Str;

#define str_gnum(str) (Str = (str), (Str->str_nok ? Str->str_nval : str_2num(Str)))

STR *eval()
{
    double value;
    STR *quicksarg[5];
    register STR **sarg = quicksarg;
    unsigned long tmplong;

    	if ((tmplong = (unsigned long) str_gnum(sarg[2])) == 0L);

    /*	This all works properly if I split the "if" statement into */
    /*	 							   */
    /* 		tmplong = (unsigned long) str_gnum(sarg[2]);       */
    /* 		if (tmplong == 0L);				   */

}

Fix: 
	Unknown.  Circumvention is to simplify the conditional expression.
