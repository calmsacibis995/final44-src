Subject: f77 "NAMELIST" not implemented
Index: bin 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	The f77 compiler does not implement "NAMELIST" I/O.  This appears
	contrary to all available documentation.  The "ps1" chapters on
	"f77" and "f77 IO" both describe "NAMELIST".  The f77 manpage does
	*not* list lack of NAMELIST as a restriction or a "bug".  One is
	therefore lead to believe that f77 *does* implement NAMELIST.

	An examination of the source code shows that NAMELIST is
	deliberately disabled.

	[This is not so much a "bug report" as a question.  *Why* was
	 f77 shipped with NAMELIST disabled?  Does it work on *any*
	 bsd release? ]

Repeat-By:
	Attempt to compile an f77 program using NAMELIST.
