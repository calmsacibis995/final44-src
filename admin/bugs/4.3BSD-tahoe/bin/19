Subject: function mkqlist has return(e) and return
Index: 	bin/make/misc.c 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	mkqlist() will return a random value if the chain it's passed
	should ever be NULL.

Repeat-By:
	% make lint
	misc.c:
	misc.c(342): warning: function mkqlist has return(e); and return;

Fix:
	qbuf[] is set to "" but not returned.  The fix is to return it.
