Subject: awk has bugs
Index: bin/awk 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	we have an old version of awk with bugs in it.
	awk does not allow more than 10 files to be open at a time.

However you can close files to get around this.  I have written small
programs which do this, but the programs bomb because there are too
many open files.  The close commands do not work.

Repeat-By:
consider the following script called makeraw
#!/bin/csh

#  This script takes an output file from the LaserWriter.
#  It is assumed that the end of the file has been cleaned of any
#  partial data.  
#  The first thing to do is to clean up any ^M characters that remain.
#  The program then goes through and extracts each individual character,
#  say A, and writes the pertinent data into A.raw.

#Change to $1 when debugged
sed -e 's///g' data | \
awk '$1 == "Character:" { filename = $2 ".raw";                         \
                          print "Making" , filename ;}
\
     /Character/,/%/  { if ( $1 == "L" || $1 == "R" ) print$0 >filename;}
\
     /^$/       {print "closing" ,filename; close(filename);}'

Now here is the file data
Character: one
L 1 1
R 1 1
%

Character: two
L 2 2
R 2 2
%

Character: three
L 3 3
R 3 3
%

Character: four
L 4 4
R 4 4
%

Character: five
L 5 5
R 5 5
%

Character: six
L 6 6
R 6 6
%

Character: seven
L 7 7
R 7 7
%

Character: eight
L 8 8
R 8 8
%

Character: nine
L 9 9
R 9 9
%

Character: ten
L 10 10
R 10 10
%

Character: eleven
L 11 11
R 11 11
