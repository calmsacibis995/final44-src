Subject: sh and su muff superuser prompt if PS1 is in environment
Index: bin/sh tahoe

Description:
	If the root account record in the /etc/passwd file specifies "/bin/sh"
	as the root's shell, and if a PS1 environment variable is present,
	the prompt is not modified (to "# " or whatever) if you use the
	su command.  (This problem also appears in 4.3BSD.)

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Tue Aug  2 12:59:23 1988
	daisy$ PS1='What now? '
	What now? export PS1
	What now? /bin/su
	Password:
	What now? exit
	What now? exit

	script done on Tue Aug  2 13:00:03 1988

Workaround:
	Don't put PS1 in the environment.

Fix:
	The BRL version of sh does stuff to ensure that a '#' shows up in
	the prompt if you're superuser; perhaps an appropriation is in order.
