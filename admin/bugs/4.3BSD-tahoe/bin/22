Subject: (RT and VAX) Version 6.0R: awk

System type, version:	(RT and VAX) Version 6.0R
                      (these version numbers are athena version
			numbers; the vax system is 4.3, and the
			RT system is AOS 4.3)

System name:		any I've tried
What's wrong:

awk 'BEGIN { printf "%d\n", 16777217; }' /dev/null 
prints "16777216" on the RT and "16777218" on the VAX.

What should have happened:

It should print 16777217.

[There may be no easy fix; the number may be stored internally as a
float with ~24 bits of mantissa.]
