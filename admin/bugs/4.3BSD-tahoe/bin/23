Subject: 4.3 Tahoe rm(1) man page
Index: bin/rm 4.3BSD-tahoe


The rm(1) man page in the 4.3 Tahoe source tree claims that "-" is the
null option that will cause rm to treat any arguments after it as
filename rather than as options.  However, since rm has been modified
to use getopt in 4.3 Tahoe, the null option is "--" instead.  The
following patch to the man page will fix the problem.
