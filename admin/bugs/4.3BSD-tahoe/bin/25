Subject: tahoe and lpr bug
Index: bin/lpr 4.3BSD-tahoe

The tahoe tape just arrived.  I checked the lpr code briefly.
It looks like the bug I mentioned to you at the course is still
present.  It'll take me several days to grind through the source
to verify that all our local mods are in place, so it'll be a few
days before I can put up tahoe and check the bug.  It's probably
easier for you to verify that the bug hasn't been fixed in some
way I didn't detect.  Here's how to check:

Create a file somewhere that only root should be able to remove.
/etc/init, /etc/passwd and /vmunix come to (the evil) mind, but
making /testfile ought to be good enough, so I'll assume that's
the target.  Then run

echo "too bad" | lpr -C 'adios
U/testfile'

as a normal user.  (Note the embedded newline in the ``class name'',
causing an unlink ``job card'' to get piggybacked in).  If this still
works, /testfile will be dutifully removed.  I haven't looked further
to see how to get superuser privileges via the bug.  I suspect that
after trashing /etc/passwd, assorted utilities might open the door.

The fix (assuming the bug still exists) is simple.
In the card() routine in lpr.c, modify

	*p1++ = c;
        while ((c = *p2++) != '\0') {
                *p1++ = c;
                len++;
        }

to be

	*p1++ = c;
        while ((c = *p2++) != '\0') {
                *p1++ = (c == '\n') ? ' ' : c;
                len++;
        }

thereby replacing embedded newlines with blanks.  This is ``safe'',
since no legitimate job card can contain a newline anyway.

If the bug has been fixed, my apologies for pestering you.
If the bug is still there, consider me mildly annoyed that something
I reported two years ago is still being circulated.
