Subject: magic number in open() call in mt.c
Index: bin 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The call to open() in mt.c uses the magic numbers 0 and 2.
Repeat-By:
	Read the code.
Fix:
	Replace the open() call with

	  open(tape, comp->c_ronly ? O_RDONLY : O_RDWR)

	You'll also want to add a "#include <sys/file.h>".
