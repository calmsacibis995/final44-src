Subject: adb breakpoint error messages are reversed

Index: bin/adb/adb.vax/pcs.c 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	The messages `too many breakpoints' and `command too long
	for breakpoint' are reversed, so that an overlong command
	prints `too many breakpoints', while running out of memory
	prints `command too long'.

Repeat-by:
	Set a ridiculously long command string in a breakpoint
	(the limits is 63 characters), and/or lower your memory limit
	and set numerous breakpoints.  Or just read the code.

Fix:
	Exchange the SZ and EX BKPT error names in case 'b'.

	A much more extensive series of fixes is forthcoming (I
	deleted the -w compilation option...).

Chris
