Subject: adb `n#0' expressions divide by 0

Index: bin/adb 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	a#b rounds a up to the next multiple of b, using the
	classic (a+b-1)/b*b sequence, and without checking to
	see if b is 0, hence 1#0 (eg) crashes adb.

Repeat-by:
	% adb
	1#0=X
	Floating exception (core dumped)
	%

Fix:
	In expr.c, check for 0 before doing round() in dyadic `#'.
	Or wait for my revised adb, since I already did this for you....
