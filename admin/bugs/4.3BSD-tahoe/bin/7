Subject: vax adb $v broken (another one for the archives)

Index: bin/adb/adb.vax/print.c 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	The VAX adb $v command prints only the low word of each
	variable.

Repeat-by:
	% adb /vmunix
	$v
	variables
	b = 9c00
	d = 4378
	e = 1614
	m = 108
	t = 9a84
	<b=X
			39c00
	$q
	%

	Note that variable b is 39c00 but prints as 9c00.  (Your
	values will differ.)

Fix:
	Copy the corrected code from the tahoe adb: change the code
	that prints variables to use `%R' format, not `%x'.  Variables
	are then also printed in the current radix, rather than always
	in hex (except that this is broken in the vax adb: you get
	either hex [radix==16] or decimal [radix!=16]).
