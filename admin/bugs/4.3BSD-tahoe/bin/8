Subject: /bin/sh [] pattern matching is inconsistent

Index: bin/sh/expand.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	[] pattern matching produces inconsistent results.

Repeat-by:
	% mkdir t; cd t
	% touch agz
	% sh
	$ echo a[k-g]*
	agz
	$ echo a[k-b]*
	a[k-b]*
	$

	Either a[k-g]* should not match agz, or a[k-b]* should match agz.
	There was once a similar bug in find (whose pattern matching code
	probably came straight out of sh), with a more interesting way
	to invoke the bug, but I have forgotten the details.

Chris
