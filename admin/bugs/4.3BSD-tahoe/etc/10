Subject: 4.3BSD: /etc/syslogd doesn't close consoles or UDP ports + FIX
Sender: daemon@bloom-beacon.MIT.EDU
Index: etc/syslogd.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	when syslogd is configured to log messages to /dev/console or to
other hosts via the @hostname forwarding conventions, and it is
reconfigured by SIGHUP, it fails to close the file descriptors it uses,
and eventually syslogd will run out of file descriptors.

Repeat-By:
	Put a line in your crontab to hangup syslogd every once in a while.
	Then put a forwarding host line in your /etc/syslog.conf.
	After a lot of hangups, watch syslog complain about a lack of
	file descriptors.  Examining with netstat shows lots of udp *.* ports.

Fix:

This patch closes the appropriate type of file descriptors:
