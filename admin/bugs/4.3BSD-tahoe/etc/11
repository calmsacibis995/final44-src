Subject: 4.3BSD Tahoe etc/htable/htable.c dereferencing nil ptr bug&fix
Index: etc 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	htable built from the 4.3BSD-tahoe release can dump core
	(on a Celerity in this case) in dogateways() when the gw pointer
	returned by gatewayto() is not nil but the g_dst pointer within
	the gateway struct pointed to by gw is nil.

Repeat-By:
	Running dbx (under which htable did not dump core btw) on the
	post-mortem core file showed that the entry in the SRI-NIC
	hosts.txt (version 850) file being processed was:

	GATEWAY : 128.36.0.1, 130.132.1.1 : ENG-GW.CS.YALE.EDU : IBM-PC/RT : UNIX : IP/GW,GW/PRIME :

	and the line in which the segmentation violation occurred was
	(~ 586-587 in dogateways() in htable.c ):

                          printgateway(ggp->g_net,
                                  gw->g_dst->g_name->name_val, gp->g_metric);


	Pointers should be checked before they are used (before they
	reference other pointers to reference other data).

Fix:

	Only output to the gateways file (call printgateways()) if
	gw->g_dst is non-zero (not nil).  We don't use the gateways file
	produced by htable anyway but just use it to produce the hosts
	and networks files periodically.
