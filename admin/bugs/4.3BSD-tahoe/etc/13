Subject: Bug in ftpd

Index: etc 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	This fix removes a null pointer dereference in ftpd due to fclose() of
	a non-open file (if "ftpusers" doesn't exist), and a lack of fclose()
	if "ftpusers" does exist and the login is refused.

Repeat-By:
	Compile ftpd on a machine that won't let you deference null pointers.
	(more exactly won't let you pass a null pointer to fclose())
	... and execute when there is no "/etc/ftpusers" file.

Version:
    static char sccsid[] = "@(#)ftpd.c	based on 5.28	(Berkeley) 4/20/89";

Fix:
	Apply the following patch.

--- ftpd.c_new	Thu Jun 29 03:48:16 1989
