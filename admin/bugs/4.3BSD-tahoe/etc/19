Subject: dump fails awkwardly if no dumpdates
Index: 	etc 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If you run "dump" and there's no /etc/dumpdates, dump
	complains about the missing file, tells you it got a SIGBUS,
	tries to proceed anyway, and eventually exits.
	You get the SIGBUS because idatev (in dumpitime.c) is still
	nil.  Look at inititimes().
Repeat-By:
	Hide /etc/dumpdates and try to dump a filesystem.
Fix:
	It would be nice if dump would scan fstab to get a list of
	filesystems and create a dumpdates for you.  Failing that,
	dump should at least handle the error more gracefully ("Can't
	proceed without dumpdates" or some such message and then
	exit).
