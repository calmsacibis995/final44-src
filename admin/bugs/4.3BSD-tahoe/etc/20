Subject: Fsck dumps core
Index: etc/fsck/pass1.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	Fsck dumps core.  An integer variable, (j in function pass1)
	can exceed 2^31.  When j is used to index dp->di_db[] it gives
	a negative offset which results in an incorrect address.

Repeat-By:
	Some probably rare combination of disk configuration, paritioning 
	and disk inconsistencies.

Fix:
	Change "etc/fsck/pass1.c" by applying the following patch.  A 
	thorough general cleanup to remove type inconsistencies between 
	daddr_t, long and unsigned int is needed, but it looks like a lot 
	of work.
