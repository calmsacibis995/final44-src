Subject: byte order check in rwhod is not general
Index: etc 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	rwhod optimizes for Big-endian machines by not bothering to
	convert the byte order of packets.  This code is controlled by
	"#if vax || pdp11".  This isn't a very general test.  How
	about something like "#if BYTE_ORDER == LITTLE_ENDIAN"?
Repeat-By:
	Bring up rwhod on an i386.
Fix:
	See Description.
