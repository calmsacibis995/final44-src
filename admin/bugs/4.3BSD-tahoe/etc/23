Subject: 4.4BSD ftpd can dump core

Subject: 4.4BSD ftpd can dump core
Index: etc/ftpd.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	When doing anonymous ftp, if a user enters a password with a
	percent sign embedded in it, the daemon can dump core.  This
	happens because setproctitle() does an sprintf() assuming the
	first argument is a format string.  When sprintf() spots the
	"%", it assumes it's a conversion spec.

Repeat-By:
	Try it... of course, your results will vary.  It just happened
	to us tonight.  

Fix:
