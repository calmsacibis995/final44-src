Subject: rlogind doesn't make pseudo-tty controlling tty
Cc: sjoerd@cwi.nl
Index: etc 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	The rlogin daemon (that is, version 5.22.1.7, which is available
	on uunet) does not make the pseudo-tty it gives you into
	your controlling tty.  With some shells, this means that you cannot
	login using rlogin.  In any case, it means that you cannot use
	job control.
Repeat-By:
	Install the version of rlogind that is on uunet and try to login
	to the machine you installed it on.  Notice that, according to
	ps, the shell that is started does not have a controlling tty.
Fix:
	The daemon dissociates itself from its old controlling tty.  The
	problem is that it has already opened the slave side of the pseudo-
	tty, so that does not become the new controlling tty.  The fix moves
	that code forward a bit.
