Subject: config doesn't include emulate.o for vmunix for vaxes
Index: etc 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: tahoe-bugs@okeeffe.berkeley.edu

Description:
	/etc/config doesn't put emulate.o in the dependency line
	for vmunix for vaxes.
Repeat-By:
	/etc/config VAXNAME; cd ../VAXNAME; make clean; make all
	(Notice that this will fail in the loader by failing to find
	emulate.o)
Fix:
	Fix the file /usr/src/etc/config/mkmakefile.c
