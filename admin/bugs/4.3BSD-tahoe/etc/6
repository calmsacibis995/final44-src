Subject: newfs sizes off by a factor of 8

Index: etc/newfs/mkfs.c 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	newfs prints `%.1fMb ... %2.fMb/g, ...'.  It carefully
	uses `M' rather than `m', but then uses `b' rather than
	`B', so it is sizing in bits, not bytes.

Repeat-by:
	obvious

Fix:
	% ed mkfs.c
	g/Mb\/g/s/Mb/MB/gp
	w
	q
