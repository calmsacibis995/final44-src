Description:
        Configuration files created by config lack data on marginal cases.
        Suppose my local configuration has no Cypher tapes, config should
        creat the file yc.h with NYC set to 0 and NCY set to 0. Instead,
        the file yc.h is created only with NYC set to 0. Later on when the
	kernel is recompiled it turns into a compilation error. The
        compilation error results from references throughout the kernel
        to then none defined constant NCY.
Repeat-By:
        When a kernel is configured to have no Cypher tapes, and probably
        any other future device that may connect to the vba via a controller.
Fix:
        A Cypher tape controller may have up to 4 tape drives connected,
        thus ((NYC -1) % 4) + 1 is equivalent to NCY. Exchanging these values
        throughout the kernel is my suggestion to remedy this situation.
