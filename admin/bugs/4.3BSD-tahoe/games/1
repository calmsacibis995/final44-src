Subject: dm does not correctly interperate dm.config file
Index: games 4.3BSD-tahoe
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 88 11:25:08 EDT
From: William King <abvax!wrk@uunet.UU.NET>

Description:
	dm does not correctly interperate the stop time listed in
	the config file. More specifically, if the stop time is listed
	as 12 games will not be reenabled at 12, instead they remain
	disabled for the entire hour of 12 and become reenabled at 13.
Repeat-By:
	try to play a game which is regulated by dm at noon with a line
	in the control file like:

	time	Monday	7	12

	wait until 1pm and try again.
Fix:
	apply the following patch to /usr/src/games/dm/dm.c
