I just found out that quiz on our Suns (SunOs 4.0) will accept
the Hague as the capital of the Netherlands. From
/usr/games/lib/quiz.k/europe :

Netherlands|Holland:The Hague|'sGravenhage|den Haag|Amsterdam

Fix:

Change this line to:
Netherlands|Holland:Amsterdam

I'd really like to know if this bug has been around for all those
years. I sure hope that the U.S. government in New York knows better !
