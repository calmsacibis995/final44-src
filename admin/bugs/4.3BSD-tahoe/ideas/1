Subject: IPC code in 4.3BSD
Index: ideas 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The IPC code in 4.3BSD, etc uses the idiom:

		m->m_off > MMAXOFF

	to determine if an mbuf has a cluster associated with it or not.
	In the name of portability, I would suggest that the above usage
	be replaced by the (already existing macro):

		M_HASCL(m)
	
	which would make porting the code easier to more, um, unusual
	architectures.


Repeat-By:
	Possess and attempt to use a Unisys 1100/90 system.  Do creative
	and unspeakable things to mbuf.h and uipc_mbuf.c.  Marvel at how
	little else needs (wrt mbufs) to change to support a brain dead
	architecture.

Fix:
	Grep for m->m_off and edit to suit.
