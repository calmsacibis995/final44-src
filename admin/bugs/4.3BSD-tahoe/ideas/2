Hi,
	Over a year ago, I changed ruserok(2) on the CF&C Sun clusters
to ignore .rhosts that were writable by group or other.  It's just an
extra expression in a conditional, and is really obvious to see that
it's not a trojan horse of any kind.  The big win is that it's death
for .rhosts viruses.  Could I convince you to put it in the next BSD
release?
