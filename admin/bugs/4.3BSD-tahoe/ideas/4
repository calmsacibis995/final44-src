Subject: capability to "turn-off" permissions granted by "hosts.equiv"

It would be nice for individual accounts to "turn-off" equivalency
between "friendly" hosts for their accounts.  That is, I may have an
account on the two friendly hosts "bob.cc.purdue.edu" and
"baz.cc.purdue.edu", but I don't want my account, "kcs", on "bob" to have
access (without a password) to my account on "baz".  Something like

	!bob.cc.purdue.edu		(or ~bob.cc.purdue.edu)

in my .rhosts would be nice.

We would be glad to do this if Berkeley would be interested in picking
this up in a future release.  If this sounds like a bad idea, or if
there is a much simpler way of doing this, let me know.  Thanks.
