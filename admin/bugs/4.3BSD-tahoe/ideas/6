Subject: I'm confused about the distribution tape
Index: ideas 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:

I just got a tape labeled 4.3bsd VAX UNIX System 6/7/86, but the tape
label says it has 9 files, but there appear to be 8 and they don't
to correspond to the paper label terribly well.  Also, I was thinking
about evaluating ingres for a database, but it doesn't appear to have been
on the tape.  

I've been trying the phone number for several hours, on and off, and it
is interminably busy.  If this 'sendbug' thing is not reasonable for this
type of complaint, I appologize.

I thought that the tahoe release was a different one; has it superseded the
4.3 release?  I don't mean to replace the 4.n system running on our Encore
Multimax with this release, but just wanted the sources to the set of
utilities.
