Subject: a pty daemon (allow non-setuid prog to get secure tty/pty pairs)
Date: Sun, 08 Oct 89 21:42:58 -0500
Index: ideas 4.3BSD-tahoe

This daemon would allow many program to get a pty owned by a given
user without being setuid root.  It would verify the user by
	user askes for a pty owned by `him'
	daemon finds a free pty/tty pair (opening pty)
	chmod the pair to 000
	chown them to the user
	close the pty
	return the filename to the user (via a UNIX dom. socket connection)

the user will
	chmod the pty/tty to 0600
	open them

and thus will prove he is the user (or a superuser, who cares).

The the user can ask the daemon to
	build a utmp (wtmp) entry for the tty

When the user is done with the pair he may
	chmod the tty to 04000 (setuid him)
	close the pty (and tty)
	tell the daemon to remove the utmp (& wtmp) entry
	let the daemon chown the pair to root.tty(666) so nondaemon procs
		can use the pair.

I have a prototype of this daemon running here at pucc.  Looks OK to me.
This lets Sun-tools/xterm/script/window/screen all run as the user.

Interested?
