Subject: Request for change in mail
Index: ideas 4.3BSD-tahoe

	I would a change to the mail program that would allow me to put a line
in my .mailrc file that would cause my EXINIT environment to change (ie., to
something like "set wm=1 noai," which is very different from the environment I
use to program in).  A way to come right up in the editor for composing
messages would be nice also (something like the 'r' or 'f' command in the rn
program).

	Thanks.
