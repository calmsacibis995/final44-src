Subject: curses doesn't restore terminal state correctly
Index: include/curses.h 4.3BSD-tahoe

As I mentioned, curses does not restore the terminal state correctly.
I haven't modified the current okeeffe version of curses.h only the
4.3BSD version (from an IBM RT).  The diff is below.  The change not
included here is that stty has been replaced the approriate ioctl.
