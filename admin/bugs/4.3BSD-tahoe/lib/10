Description:
	The C compiler produces code for converting short values to longs
	and back again when calling subroutines. If these values are
	used for testing conditions, the results are incorrect
Repeat-By:
Compile the following code:

	main()
	{
		short temp, Hprevious();
		int i;

		srandom(1);
		for(i=0; (temp = Hprevious(i)) >= 0; i++);

		printf("Out of loop\n");
	}

	short
	Hprevious(i)
	{

		int j;

		j = random();

		printf("Hprevious returning %d\n",(j&01) ? -1: 1);
		if(j & 01)
			return((short)-1);
		else
			return((short)1);
	}

Looking at (some of) the assembler produced when compiling this yields:
	LL0:
		.data
		.text
		.align	1
		.globl	_main
	_main:
		.word	L12
		jbr 	L14
	L15:
		pushl	$1
		callf	$8,_srandom
		clrl	-60(fp)
	L20:
		pushl	-60(fp)
		callf	$8,_Hprevious
		cvtlw	r0,-54(fp)	/* This is the offending instruction */
		jlss	L19
		.
		.
		.
It seems that the cvtlw instruction gets a sign extended result in r0,
since the function will issu a "cvtwl" to get it's value into r0. But,
the cvtlw instruction doesn't seem to be setting the condition codes
correctly. Specifically, it is setting the V (overflow) bit but not the
N (negative) bit, thought it might store a short (-1).

The bug described in tahoe/lib/10 is really the same as the bug in
tahoe/lib/7, perhaps with some confusion about C semantics added.  I
tried the example just now with the latest compiler and it produced the
right code and ran as expected, while the example definitely failed
when compiled with the old ccom.  I also tried compiling it with the
optimizer enabled and it looked good and worked right.
