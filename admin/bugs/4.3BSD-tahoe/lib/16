Subject: problem in bcopy documentation
Index: lib/libc/vax/gen/bcopy.s,man3/bcopy.3 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	The "man entry" for bcopy says *NOTHING* about how it handles
	overlaping copies.  The *CODE* clearly checks, and does it
	"correctly".

	This is of  GREATER concern as MORE and MORE *DIFERENT* computers
	start using UNIX.  Many people look to the BSD distributions as
	"THE-STANDARD"  

	There are programs (emacs, and maybe X) that *NEED* this behaviour
	to work, *SO*, when someone implements a NEW [efficient] bcopy on 
	a new machine, s/he *MUST* handle overlaps, or be hit with headaches!
	If the implementor does NOT look at the vax .S files, s/he will have
	little or no chance of figuring this out.

	By the way:  The "Sun man-bcopy" *DOES* state that it DOES handle
		     overlaps.

Fix:
	State one of the following in the man page for bcopy:
	1) bcopy always handles overlaps correctly.
	2) bcopy is NOT gaurenteed to handle overlaps correctly.

	Note that fix 2) tecnically breaks programs like emacs that currently
	depend on the vax/sun behavior.
