In looking at strcasecmp that is supplied with the BIND release, I disagree
with some entries in the mapping table.  The 7 bit ASCII is fine.  It
looks like the 7 bit mapping is duplicated with the 8th bit on for the
rest of the characters.  This includes the case folding.  In my opinion,
the 8 bit characters should map onto themselves.  What 8 bit characters
mean depends on the language use which differs between vendors.
