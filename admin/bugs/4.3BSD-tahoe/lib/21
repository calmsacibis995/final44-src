Subject: syslog(3) takes a fixed, small number of parameters
Index: lib 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The syslog(3) library routine only takes 4 parameters in addition
	to the format string.  Not only is this not documented, it seems
	too small.

Repeat-By:
	Inspection.

Fix:
	I guess something like a varargs implementation.

	Actually, while you're at it, an option to openlog() to have syslog
	use an internet domain socket rather than a UNIX domain socket.  This
	would be useful for programs that do a chroot(2) system call, like
	the FTP daemon.
