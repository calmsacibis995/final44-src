Subject: assuming that all dialup lines are named ttyd? is wrong
Index: lib 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.UUCP

Description:
	Most all programs assume that all ttys that are dialup have a
	device name in the form of ttyd?. While this is simple, it is
	a bit restrictive. A better approach would be to use the
	ty_status field of the ttyent struct. This way /etc/ttys could
	be used so specify which lines are dialup.

Repeat-By:
	inspect login.c, et. al. and notice tests in the form:

		if (tty[sizeof("tty")-1] == 'd')

	
Fix:
	apply the following patch to lib/libc/gen/getttyent.c

122a123,124
> 		else if (strncmp(p, "dialup", 6) == 0 && space(6))
> 			tty.ty_status |= TTY_DIALUP;

	and add
#define TTY_DIALUP	0x4

	to ttyent.h
