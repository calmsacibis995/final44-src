Dear Bugs Bunny,

	I have found a _very_ irritating bug in the curses package.  In the
routines overwrite() and overlay() there are calls on the routine touchwin().
In both cases they pass the second parameter as the _screen_ y position,
instead of the relative y inside the window.  The incorrect line is

	touchline(win2, y, startx - win2->_begx, endx - win2->_begx);

The correct line is

	touchline(win2, y - win2->_begy, startx-win2->_begx, endx-win2->_begx);
			 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is a bitch to find, as it shows up by corrupting the overhead
block used by malloc(), so you end up with segmentation violations in the call
on free().

				Ronnie
