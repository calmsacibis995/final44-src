Subject: vax sbrk uses register it shouldn't
Index: lib 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	The sbrk system call code, src/lib/libc/vax/sbrk.c, uses r3
	and expects it to be preserved across the system call.

	It so happens that the kernel implementation doesn't use
	r3, but it isn't saved anywhere.
Repeat-By:
	Use another compiler to compile the kernel.
Fix:
	Use another register, or save r3 before/after the call.
