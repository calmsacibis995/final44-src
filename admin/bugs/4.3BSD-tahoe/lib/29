Subject: getopt() routine
Index: lib/libc/sys5/getopt.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Keith,
I beleive you had sent Don Cragun a new implementation of the
getopt() routine. I ran SVVS on a system using this version
of getopt() and the test suite failed.

The following describes what SVVS does:
	- Calls getopt several times to get options until it 
	  hits EOF.
	- Resets optind to 1, calls getopt with new set of 
	  options in argv. Expects getopt() to act like
	  before returning options listed.

But the new version of getopt() you had sent to Don, does not 
reset the static pointer "place" to EMSG when it returns EOF
after hitting a '-'. Therefore when getopt() is reentered 
it assumes that place points to a valid string and does not
set it to nargv[optind]. Note that regular applications are
not likely to run into this problem because in general they 
don't call getopt() after getting EOF.

To fix this the following lines of code should be changed:
	if (!*place) {
		if (optind >= nargc || *(place = nargv[optind]) != '-')
			return(EOF);
		if (place[1] && *++place == '-') {
			++optind;
			return(EOF);
		}
	}

to:
	if (!*place) {
		if (optind >= nargc || *(place = nargv[optind]) != '-') {
			place = EMSG;
			return(EOF);
		}
		if (place[1] && *++place == '-') {
			++optind;
			place = EMSG;
			return(EOF);
		}
	}

Don asked me to report this problem to you so that we have an
identical getopt() routine. Please let me know if you have
any questions.
