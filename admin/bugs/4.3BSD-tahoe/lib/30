Subject: ttyslot does not call setttyent()
Index: lib/libc/gen/ttyslot.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	ttyslot does not call setttyent() so it can fail if getttyent has
	been used already. The problem made it self evident in login. Login
	wouldgo trough /etc/ttys with getttyent trying to see if you are on
	a secure terminal. After that it uses ttyslot to figure out where
	you are in /etc/ttys, and would fail.
Repeat-By:
	logging in as root, and notice that it would not put you in utmp.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch to ttyslot.c

*** ttyslot.c.orig	Thu Mar 29 17:37:04 1990
- --- ttyslot.c	Thu Mar 29 17:37:50 1990

  	int cnt;
  	char *name, *rindex(), *ttyname();
  
+ 	setttyent();
  	for (cnt = 0; cnt < 3; ++cnt) 
  		if (name = ttyname(cnt)) {
  			if (p = rindex(name, '/'))
