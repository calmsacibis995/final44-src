I seem to have the habit of loosing the mailing address for bug-reports,
anyway...

There is an error in additem in ndbm.c. The if-test 
> if (i1 <= (i2+3) * sizeof(short))
fails on newer compilers because expressions with (int) op (unsigned int)
gets converted to (unsigned int). In this case, the test fails whenever
i1 is negative, leading to `random' overwriting of memory.

Fix:

if (i1 < 0 || i1 <= (i2+3) * sizeof(short))

Second, I've took the time to patch ndbm.c to store the dbase in network
byte order. That way, dbm dbases may be shared between multiple architectures.
I've put some ifdef's around the patches. Overhead seem to be about 8%.
Are you interested in these changes?

Ole Bjorn.
