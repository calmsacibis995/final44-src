Subject: strncat.s is probably broken

Description:
	The assembly language version of strncat for the tahoe system
	is probably broken for cases where the count is 0 or negative.
Repeat-By:
	Code inspection.  The following is cut from the beginning of
	the source file.  Note that the comment says "Return s1".

	/*
	 * Concatenate s2 on the end of s1.  S1's space must be large enough.
	 * At most n characters are moved.
	 * Return s1.
	 * 
	 * char *strncat(s1, s2, n)
	 * register char *s1, *s2;
	 * register n;
	 */
	#include "DEFS.h"
	
	ENTRY(strncat, 0)
		tstl	12(fp)
		jgtr	n_ok
		movl	4(fp),r0
		clrb	r0
		ret
	n_ok:
	...

	This can't possibly return s1, since s1 is in 4(fp) and the
	copy in r0 is cleared by the "clrb r0" instruction.
Fix:
	Delete the "clrb r0" instruction.  It was "clrb (r0)" in the
	original CCI source, which was an even worse error.
