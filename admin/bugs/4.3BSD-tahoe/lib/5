Subject: USG_COMPAT option in ctime.c conflicts with timezone.c
Date: Fri, 21 Aug 87 13:36:50 EDT
Index: lib/libc/gen/timezone.c tahoe

Description:
	I get symbol conflicts when I attempt to enable the USG_COMPAT
	option in ctime.c; the reference to "time_t timezone" in
	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/ctime.c conflicts with the definition
	of "char *timezone()" in timezone.c.  Since ctime.c calls
	_tztab() in timezone.c, this doesn't work well.
Repeat-By:
	Trying to port the System V emulation package to the 4.3BSD
	tahoe system.
Fix:
	You may chose to pretend that the problem doesn't exist, but it
	was a bit sloppy to re-use the "timezone" symbol for something
	completely different.  I have renamed it to _timezone in my
	hacked version of timezone.c for the compatibility package;
	that might be something to be included in the USG_COMPAT
	feature.  While fixing System V incompatibilities, you might
	also change the reference of "index()" to "strchr()"

	To end on a positive note: thank you for including the
	USG_COMPAT code in ctime.c, it made the porting job much easier.
