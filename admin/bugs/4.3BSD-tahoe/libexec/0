Subject: Bug in 4.4 (and bsd-fixes) rshd
Date: Thu, 28 Dec 89 14:57:40 EST
From: steve@umiacs.UMD.EDU
Index: libexec/rshd/rshd.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	If someone is spoofing domain name lookups and logs into a
	host running the 4.4BSD (or bsd-fixes) rshd, rshd may dump
	core.

Repeat-By:
	Diddle a domain name server so the IP address of the machine you
	log in from ("cracker") translates to a wrong hostname, and arrange
	for the wrong hostname to have an A record associated with it (and
	make sure it doesn't match the original address).  For example, I
	made 128.8.120.33 correspond to foobar.umiacs.umd.edu, and put an
	A record on that for 128.8.120.34.

	Install the new rshd on a machine whose architecture has problems
	with null pointer dereferences.  I used a DECstation.  Any other
	will do.

	Rsh from cracker into the machine running the new rshd.  The result
	is likely to be something like:

		fnord.umiacs.umd.edu: Error 0

	The rshd on the victim machine has crapped out.

Fix:
	In the code in doit() that cycles through hp->h_addr_list, move the
	comparison against NULL up above the bcmp.  Once I did that, I got
	the expected "Host name mismatch" error when rshing in from cracker.
