It seems to me that the call to ttyname() near line 445 in putf() in
getty/main.c is both expensive and incorrect.  I think the proper way to
expand "%t" is using the tty name already determined and stored in the global
"ttyn".  The reason I noticed it is that some of our ttys are symlinked, and
getty was printing the name of the tty, rather than the name of the link,
the latter having been passed as an argument to getty.  Also note that
ttyname() requires a scan of /dev/, and is thus pretty costly, even
considering the caches.

Is there some security reason that I shouldn't do the following?
