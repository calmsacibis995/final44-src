Subject: RMT(8) lies about the protocol used to talk to "rmt"
Index: man 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	(The previous bug report had an error in the fixed manual page;
	the "S" command does *not* take a newline at the end.)
	The description in RMT(8) of the protocol used to talk to
	"/etc/rmt" is incorrect.  It claims that 1) spaces separate the
	command from the first argument to the command and 2) spaces
	separate the arguments from each other.  In fact, nothing
	separates the command from its first argument, and newlines
	separate the arguments from each other.
Repeat-By:
	Try to use "/etc/rmt" using the protocol described in RMT(8),
	and notice that you don't get very far.
Fix:
