Subject: atof.3 manual page doesn't mention math.h and should
Index: man/man3/atof.3 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	atof.3 manual page doesn't mention that you have to
	"#include <math.a>" if you want atof() to work the way
	you would expect.

Repeat-By:
	type "man atof".  Try using atof() without either declaring
	it appropriately or including math.h and note the result.

Fix: apply following context diffs
