Subject: yacc %union fails
Index: pgrm/yacc 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	yacc emits `#define YYSTYPE int' even if there is a %union
	declaration, so long as there are no %type token declarations.

Repeat-by:
	Feed this to yacc:

		%union { char *t; struct foo *p;
		}
		%token END
		%%
		prog: END;

	and look at the output.  Note that the bug goes away if
	you add `%type <t> END'.

	This might not be worth fixing, but is worth noting in the
	documentation if nothing else.
