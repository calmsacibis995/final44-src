Subject: Possible VAX f77 compiler bug
Index: pgrm/f77 4.3BSD-tahoe

  The bugs described below are bugs with the BSD f77 software, so I
think I'm supposed to report them to you.

  I'm not holding my breath waiting for them to get fixed :-), but I
thought you might like to know about them anyway.

   I found the problem with the user's code and explained the fixes in OLC.
There is a "bug" in the compiler in that the f77 compiler fails to indicate 
2 errors:

    1. The f77 compiler does not give an error message when a varibale in 
    named common is initialized in a data statement.  
  
    See para 9.2 of American National Standard Programming Language FORTRAN
    ANSI X3.9-1978 for Data statement restrictions.

    2. The f77 compiler does not give an error message when executable
    statements appear in a BLOCK DATA subprogram.

    See para 16.1 of above referenced document for block data subprogram
    restrictions.

Here is a test program:
c
c  test.f
c
      block data steve
       common /junk/ a,b,c
       data a /10.0/
       b = 0.0
       end
c
c
       subroutine test
       common /junk/ a,b,c
       data c /1.0/
       write (6,*) b,c
       return
       end

Compiler output:
E40-369-2% f77 -c test.f
test.f:
   BLOCK DATA steve:
   test:
