Sun-Software-Release-Number:
	SunOS 4.0 + "General-Hy patch"

Description:
	Both SunOS 4.0 and MORE/bsd's umount commands sometimes yield an
	exit value of 0, meaning that the command worked, when the command
	actually failed.

Repeat-By:
	The "Device busy" case applies to both SunOS 4.0 and MORE/bsd 4.3:

				Script started on Thu Nov 17 15:19:21 1988
				elsie# cd /c
				elsie# /etc/umount /c
				/home: Device busy
				elsie# echo $?
SHOULD BE NON-ZERO>>>>		0
				elsie# exit

				script done on Thu Nov 17 15:19:32 1988

	The "Not owner" case applies to MORE/bsd 4.3. . .
				Script started on Thu Nov 17 15:27:22 1988
				elmer$ /etc/umount /c
				/c: Not owner
				elmer$ echo $?
SHOULD BE NON-ZERO>>>>		0
				elmer$ exit

				script done on Thu Nov 17 15:27:38 1988
	. . .but *not* to SunOS 4.0:
				Script started on Thu Nov 17 15:28:29 1988
				elsie$ /etc/umount /home
				Must be root to use umount
				elsie$ echo $?
GOOD JOB, SUN!>>>>		1
				elsie$ exit
