At the end of main() in /etc/dump, I don't believe things are being
done in the best possible order.  In particular, I think it is
possible for a slave to encounter an error writing the tape *after*
the master process has already done the putitime() call.  (I once had
a dump offer to rewrite the tape after it had said "DUMP IS DONE!".)
I think the patch below should be applied.

Comments?
