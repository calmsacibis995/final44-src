Subject: Bug in shadow vipw/vipw.c
Index: sbin/vipw 4.3BSD-tahoe

There is a bug in the vipw.c file that is distributed with the shadow
patches to BSD Unix. Basically, the supplied code does an fstat on the
temp file before and after an edit to determine if it was changed. The
problem occurs because there is not a second open call prior to the
second fstat. When used with editors such as GNU emacs, the current
code will never show the file to be modified because the single file
descriptor, fd, will always refer to the original file, not the modified
version.

The solution is to do a second open on the temp file before the second
fstat.

Thanks,

Exactly. They, basically, rename the first file (using link and unlink)
and open a new, modified, copy. Since the shadow vipw only opens the
file once, and since the copy, not the original, is what is changed,
no update occurs.
