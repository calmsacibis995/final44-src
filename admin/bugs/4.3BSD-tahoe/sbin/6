Subject: Dump hangs notifying bogus pseudo-tty

Relevant systems:
	Sun 3/180 S/N 628c0890  	Alliant FX-80 S/N B508-250 (8ACE 3IP)
	SunOS v3.5.2 (4.2 1/2 BSD)	Concentrix v5.5 (4.3BSD clone)
	It is suspected that all versions of "dump" have the same weakness.
Product:	UNIX system administration software: /etc/dump
Title:		Dump hangs notifying bogus pseudo-tty
Severity:	3 (can be worked around but moderately troublesome)
Security catg:	Non-proprietary
Description:
The "n" (notify) switch of dump causes the 2nd child of dump to locate each
logged-in member of group "operator", change its controlling tty to his 
login tty, and write on his tty, when the dump finishes or needs attention.
If utmp wrongly shows an operator logged in when he isn't, the notification
is given to that tty anyway.  If it's a pseudo-tty, dump hangs forever --
probably because nobody is reading the master pty.  This is very troublesome
when dumps are executed overnight from cron.  Dump should check the tty 
more robustly or at least should time out.  Workaround: don't specify "n".
