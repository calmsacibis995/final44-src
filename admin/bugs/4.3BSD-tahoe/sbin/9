Description:
	The SunOS 4.0.3 "dump" command dumps the data associated with inodes
	even if only the inode itself has changed.

Repeat-By:
	The dump at "A>>>>" below produces just a little output (at "B>>>>").
	We then "chmod" a file (at "C>>>>"), after which a dump (at "D>>>>")
	produces a lot of output (at "E>>>>").
