Subject: Standalone drivers only work with controller zero
Index: sys/tahoestand/vd.c tahoe

Description:
	The standalone drivers only work correctly with disk controller
	zero. 
Repeat-By:
	Try to boot or copy a system to anything other than disk controller
	zero.
Fix:
	Change vd.c so that NDRIVES is set to 4 instead of 8.  The current
	disk controllers can only handle 4 drives.  Then recompile the
	standalone stuff.

	[Maybe the standalone code should be changed to look more like the
	format program where it asks you which controller, drive, and
	partition you want to work with.]
