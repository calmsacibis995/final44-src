Thanks for the quick service.  One little request (call it a vote, in
case your other customers object):  could you please use context
diffs?  I have already made changes to some of the distributed files
and I want to use "patch" to install your edits.  I get a bit nervous
about having "patch" install additions reliably without context.  I'll
patch this set into the original files, so don't worry about re-sending.
