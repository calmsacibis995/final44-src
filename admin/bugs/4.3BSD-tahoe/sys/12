Subject: /sys/conf/Makefile.* give awk syntax errors
Date: Fri, 08 May 87 10:27:30 -0500
From: jim%chuck@bellcore.com
Index: sys tahoe

Description:
	'make depend' fails with an awk syntax error if using a more
	recent version of awk.

	the accidental allowing of pattern-action statements on one
	line separated by semi-colons has gone with grammatical
	cleanups.

Repeat-By:
	cd /sys/SYSTEM; make depend

Fix:

	The fix for /sys/conf/Makefile.vax follows. A similar fix
	is required for /sys/conf/Makefile.tahoe.
