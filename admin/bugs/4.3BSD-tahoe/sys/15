Subject: The 6250 Tape drive incorrectly positions it self after eof
Index: sys tahoe

Description:
	The 6250 tape drive incorrectly positions the tape after a double
	eof is written.
Repeat-By:
	dd if=/etc/hosts of=/dev/rmt12
	dd if=/etc/hosts of=/dev/rmt12
	mt rew
	dd if=/dev/rmt12
	
	2 copyies of the host file are concatenated together without an
	eof between them.
Fix:
	Grotty, but this seems to work.

	2 copies of the host file are concatenated together without an
	eof between them.
Fix:
	My previous patch was in error.  The problem seems to be with the
	tapemasher controller.  Some commands don't work with a repition
	factor, one of which is the write eof function.  The previous patch
	correctly positions the drive, but there is only one eof written
	at the end of the tape.
	
	This might only be a problem with 6250 drives (Cipher M990), but I am
	not sure as I don't have a 1600 bpi drive to test with.

	The following patch works with the 6250 tape drive and correctly
	writes 2 eofs up close.
