Subject: tahoe calloc panic during autoconfig
Date: Wed, 15 Jul 87 14:58:29 EDT
Index: sys tahoe

After a long delay due to firefighting, I finally booted a tahoe
kernel.  I got a  "panic: calloc" while trying to probe the third disk
controller (I configured 4).  The problem seems to be caused by a
combination of large (64k) buffers calloc'ed for each controller and a
small allocation of contiguous address space for calloc calls.  The
line in locore.s is:

	SYSMAP(camap	,cabase		,(4*32+4)*CLSIZE )

This gives me 132k of buffer space and I need 256 plus whatever else
is needed for other devices.  What are the magic constants in the
above declaration, and how do you really want to fix this?  My temporary
solution is to change (4*32+4) to (5*64+4).
