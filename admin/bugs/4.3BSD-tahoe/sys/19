Now I know why I can't boot from drive 2, controller 3, but I'm not
sure what to do about it.  When "setroot" is entered, the variable
"bootdev" is set to a3020001, which breaks down to magic = B_DEVMAGIC,
majdev = 1, part = 0, unit = 2 and adaptor = 3.  These values satisfy
the initial validity checks, so setroot falls into the loop that scans
the "vbdinit" table.  Unfortunately, the line

	vbap->ui_vbanum == adaptor &&

doesn't hack it.  For all active devices ui_vbanum is 0, which probably
makes sense if the variable is referring to a vba number; I only have
one vba.  "adaptor", on the other hand is not a vba number, it's a
disk controller number.  Should I change the comparison to

	vbap->ui_ctlr == adaptor &&

(and probably also change the name of the variable from "adaptor" to
"controller") or is there a missing test?

One other note while I'm at it.  I think the test

	if (majdev > sizeof(devname) / sizeof(devname[0]))
		return;

is off by 1: majdev is 0 -> 2, the size is 3.
