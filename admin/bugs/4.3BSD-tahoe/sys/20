Subject: cy.c doesn't properly respond to write "retry unsuccessful" errors
Index: sys tahoe

Description:
	The cy driver, when it gets a retry error while writing (HERR) doesn't
	handle the retry successfully. Currently, it stops with a hard error
	and does not attempt to write a longer inter-record gap and try
	again.
Repeat-By:
	Find a tape with a bad spot. Try writing on it. Notice that it
	will always fail, even though the tape will probably work on
	other tape drives running 4.3.
Fix:
	Reclassify the retry error as soft so that the cystart routine will
	write a gap and retry the operation. (Note: line numbers are
	different than the 4.3 tahoe beta distribution)
