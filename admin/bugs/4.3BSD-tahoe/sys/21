Subject: Tahoe newfs makes bad superblock if pack is not labeled
Date: Fri, 11 Sep 87 12:48:02 EST
Index: sys/tahoevba/vd.c tahoe

Description:
	I attempted to create a new file system on an xfd drive
	with newfs without first labeling the pack.  The command
	executed without error, but the resulting file system had
	a bad superblock according to fsck.

Repeat-By:
	Run newfs on an unlabeled disk pack.

Fix:
	I'm not sure what is appropriate.  Assuming that my guess
	about a missing label is correct, I would appreciate an
	error message explaining what I have to do.  If my guess
	is wrong, newfs is broken.
