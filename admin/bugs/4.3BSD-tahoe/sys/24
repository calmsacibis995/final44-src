Subject: /sys/sys/uipc_socket.c and /sys/sys/uipc_socket2.c
Index: sys 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	/sys/sys/uipc_socket.c and /sys/sys/uipc_socket2.c seem to use
	CLBYTES while MCLBYTES seems more approriate.  Specifically, in
	uipc_socket.c an MCLGET(m) is done, and the m->m_len is checked
	against CLBYTES.  /sys/h/mbuf.h will set m_len to MCLBYTES when a
	cluster is available.  If the cluster size is different from the
	mbuf cluster size, this test isn't valid.

Repeat-By:
	Buy an UNISYS 1100.  Think and ponder on the mbuf code.

Fix:
	I might be totally confused, but I think the references to CLBYTES
	need to be changed to MCLBYTES.
