Following are several bugs in the distibution as received:

1.    The driver for smd and xsd doesn't work.  Attempts to boot either
      the miniroot or the root (brought in by restore under 4.2) give a
      
	    trap type 8, code 5a, pc = c00219a4
	    panic: Segmentation fault

      The root boots fine on an xfd.

The Makefile constructed by config is faulty as follows:

2.    CFILES contains ../swapgeneric.c
      The file is actually ../tahoe/swapgeneric.c 
      More like previous versions, the file swap{sysname}.c should
      be created in the IDENT directory and CFILES contain just
      "swap{sysname}.c".

Fixing 2 above by patching the Makefile, one still cannot "make depend"

3.    "../tahoe/machdep.c", line 150: MAXUSERS undefined
       This is due to ../tahoe/machdep.c being in CFILES.
       While the Makefile knows that ../tahoe/machdep.c needs ${PARAM},
       "make depend" does a cc of all CFILES without a ${PARAM}

I suspect the problem with the driver for smd and xsd have sector set
to 1024 in the driver, while xfd has 512.  I cannot verify this since
I can't make a system.  If you have, or will have, quick fixes for 2
and 3 above, please let me know before I start hacking away at your
config.
