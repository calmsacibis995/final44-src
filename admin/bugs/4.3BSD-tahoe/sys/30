Subject: /sys/stand/copy.c does not correctly size tape blocksize
Index: sys 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.UUCP

Description:
	/sys/stand/copy.c does not correctly adjust to a tape
	blocksize other than the default 10240.
Repeat-By:
	use the standalone copy program to load a file with a
	blocksize other than 10240. It doesn't work.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch to /sys/stand/copy.c
Caveats:
	This patch assumes that the stand alone device drivers
	correctly return the number of characters read. See my
	previous patch to /sys/vaxstand/tmscp.c. 

	I don't know about the 'bug in the ht driver' which has
	a special piece of code in copy.c to compensate for. This
	may need bo be modified. If someone does work on this I
	would appreciate receiving updated code.

	This version has only been tested against the tmscp diver.
