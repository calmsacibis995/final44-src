Subject: mpcc's can ignore carrier while waiting in mpopen()
Index: sys/tahoevba/mp.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	When a connection is dropped with a background job running,
	mpclose is not called. The result is that on a subsequent
	call to mpopen() by getty can result in waiting for carrier
	without having carrier detect enabled under certain timing
	situations.
Repeat-By:
	Hang a background job on a mpcc port. Drop carrier and
	wait for the new getty. If the background job completes
	before the mpopen() completes, the firmware in the board
	can end up in a state where carrier is ignored. The mpopen()
	will never complete.
Fix:
	The problem is that mpopen() does not forces carrier detect
	on before waiting for carrier under all conditions.
	The context diff below fixes this situation. Also included
	is a small fix to check ispeed instead of ospeed for 0
	baud cases (using stty 0 to force a line disconnect). This
	makes mp.c consistant with all other tty device drivers
	who check ispeed for the 0 baud case.
