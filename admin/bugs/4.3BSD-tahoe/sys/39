Subject: mpcc ports hang with TS_BUSY
#Subject: mpcc ports hang with TS_BUSY on an event that never occurs due to a
#	 firmware hang

Description:
	It is possible to put a mpcc port into an state where a EVCMD_WRITE
	command never completes and the port will not respond to any
	terminal data.
Repeat-By:
	(This will seem hard to believe, but it happened several times a day
	on both CCI's. it took forever to track down).

	This procedure worked on two different CCI's and 8 different MPCC
	boards. You need the port in raw or cbreak mode to see the problem,
	using rlogin is an easy way to repeat it.
	
	1) log into a mpcc port with a terminal that sends EVEN parity
	2) use the standard settings for line kill ... etc (as shown by 
	   stty everything) EXCEPT erase is set to backspace and <delete>
	   is not set to anything.

	% stty evrything
	new tty, speed 9600 baud, 60 rows, 80 columns
	even odd -raw -nl echo -lcase -tandem -tabs -cbreak 
	crt: (crtbs crterase crtkill ctlecho) -tostop 
	-tilde -flusho -mdmbuf -litout -pass8 -nohang 
	-pendin decctlq -noflsh 
	erase kill  werase rprnt  flush  lnext  susp   intr   quit   stop eof
	^H    ^U    ^W     ^R     ^O     ^V     ^Z/^Y  ^C     ^\    ^S/^Q  ^D 

	3) rlogin into another machine (like a vax). 
	4) on the remote machine (the vax) use the standard setting for line
	   kill ... etc (as shown by stty everything) EXCEPT erase is set
	   to backspace and <delete> is not set to anything.
	5) on the remote machine type a few characters then a <delete>,
	   port is now wedged on the mpcc. The only way to clear it
	   is to download the microcode for the entire board.
Fix:
	Setting the data size and parity correctly for the terminal mode
	in mpparem() fixed the problem. No side effects have occurred on
	a heavily used system.  I have alerted CCI to the firmware weirdness
	on handling an character with 8 ones in a row (a delete with even 
	parity).
