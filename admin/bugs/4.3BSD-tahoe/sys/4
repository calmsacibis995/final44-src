I suppose your bug reader will choke on this, but...

Not really a bug, I hope - I am trying to add the definition
for CDC 9771 disks to /etc/disktab and I am seeing some strangeness.
The xfd disk entry has had its entries modified to describe
512-byte sectors; most of the other disk types seem to describe
1024-byte sectors.  At least the sizes are the same as on the
last CCI release of 4.2, and I know they were trying to force
everything to be in units of 1024.  What is going on?  How do
I decide which convention to use, and what will get confused
if I guess wrong?  The installation guide doesn't seem to give
much help here; it still has references to DEC drives.
