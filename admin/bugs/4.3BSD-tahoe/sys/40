Subject: TIOCSTI checks are insufficient
Index: sys/tty.c tahoe

I might as well file it.  -Chris

#Index: /sys/sys/tty.c 4.3BSD,4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	The security checking in TIOCSPGRP is insufficient to do
	what it was designed to do (which is not really all that
	much anyway).

Repeat-by:
	Examination.
