Subject: Vax GENERIC doesn't accept any input to "Root device?" prompt

Index: sys 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	When booting a 4.3tahoe Vax generic kernel from a non-A partition
	(e.g., up(0,6)vmunix), the kernel asks "Root device" after auto-
	configuration completes.  If one answers "up0", the error message
	says "use hp%d, up%d, ...".  If one answers "up", the error message
	says "bad/missing unit number".  The same errors are given no
	matter what input is provided.  No input will be accepted at this
	point.

	The problem was caused when the code in vax/swapgeneric was changed
	(relative to 4.3) to support device types with more than 2 characters
	(specifically, "kra").  The code was incorrectly changed, and tried
	to look for both strings to end with a null at the same point.
	Thus, if one entered "up0", the code compares it against "up", and
	fails because one ends before the other.  If one enters "up", that
	part of the code passes it, and the second check (correctly) fails
	to find the unit number.

Repeat-By:
	I created the 4.3tahoe system in the "g" partition of an
	eagle disk.  This work was done on a VAX 730.  Up0g was
	mounted on /tahoe, and the kernel was built as /tahoe/vmunix.
	I booted with "up(0,6)genvmunix".  At the "Root device?"
	prompt, the kernel accepted no input.

Fix:
