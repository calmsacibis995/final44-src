Subject: TIOCCONS ioctl defined badly
Index: sys 4.3BSD-tahoe
Cc: sjoerd@cwi.nl

Description:
	The TIOCCONS ioctl is defined badly.  The code in sys/tty.c
	expects an argument, which indicates whether the virtual console
	should be set or released.  However, TIOCCONS is defined so that
	no data is copied from user space to kernel space.
Repeat-By:
	Inspection of the code.
Fix:
	Change the definition of TIOCCONS in h/ioctl.h to the following.
	#define TIOCCONS	_IOW('t', 98, int)	/* become virtual console */
