Subject: processes eventually stall sleeping on wantkmemmap.
Index: sys 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When we mount filesystems on more than one disk drive,
	processes eventually stall sleeping on wantkmemmap.

Repeat-By:
	The machines are tinyvax-3200's, each with a KDA50 driving
	an RA60 and some RA81's, and some other goodies.

	Our kernels made from the 4.3Tahoe src, updated through
	the 3200 patches, run apparently successfully.

	However when we mount filesystems on more than one disk
	drive, processes eventually stall sleeping on wantkmemmap.
