Subject: The tape drive always rewinds, even if no-rewind is wanted.
Index: sys/tahoevba/cy.c tahoe

Description:
	The no-rewind function doesn't work on the tape drive.
Repeat-By:
	Try:	mt fsf 1 	and watch the tape skip forward one
	file and rewind.
Fix:
	Change the value of T_NOREWIND in cy.c from 0x04 to 0x80.  The
	minor device number of the no-rewind function is 128.

	[It sure would be nice to be able to software select densities,
	but as near as I can tell the tapemasher controller doesn't have
	this capability.]
