Subject: poc1, poc2, fppoc, & vdformat are missing on the boot tape.
Index: sys/tahoedist/buildboot tahoe

Description:
	The file system that newfs creates isn't large enough to
	handle all the standalone stuff.  It is very handy to have
	vdformat on the boot tape.
Repeat-By:
	Try to make a bootable tape with everything on it.
Fix:
	Increase the file system size in buildboot to 750 (from 500).  Also,
	change the size for the dd image in sys/maketape to be 375 (from 250).
	Then everything fits.

	[Is a standalone version of ls needed?  There is the prom "fc"
	function.]
