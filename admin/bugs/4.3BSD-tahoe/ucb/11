Subject: Structure size limitation
Index: ucb/pascal tahoe

Description:
	Compiler (code generator) did not allow passing references by
	value when the stack size exceeded 65k.  The 65k limit is imposed
	for VAX architecture, but should not be a limitation for the CCI
	tahoe machine.
Repeat-By:
	Change the restriction from every environment to VAX only.
Fix:
