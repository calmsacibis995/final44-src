Subject: integer constants lose sign value
Index: ucb/pascal tahoe

Description:
	PC does not recognize integer, signed , constants.
Repeat-By:
	note following program.  Looks like symbol table does not use
	the sign portion.  This works properly under the VAX version,
	and also under pi for tahoe.
source:

program tex (input, output) ;

{The negative constants are also a major problem. This works just fine
on the vax. }

const

	memmin = -300;

var 
	x, y : integer ;

begin

	x := memmin;

	writeln ('memmin > ', memmin);

end.

-------------------------- cut ------------------------------

this gives    >   x >      65236  memmin >      65236
