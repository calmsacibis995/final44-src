Subject: Inline code used for IN stmt
Index: ucb/pascal tahoe

Description:
	Inline code is now being generated for SET tests with IN membership.
	The library routine IN.c is not linked.  This should probably be
	done only if the -O was specified.
Repeat-By:
	Previous version of code generator pushed arguments on the stack
	and then called a library routine IN.c to process the test for
	membership.  Now the code is being generated inline, but IN.c still
	exists in /usr/lib/libpc.a
Source:

program SetTest (input, output) ;

{  This program tests the code generator and IN.c function of sets.  
   The tahoe machine is not generating the correct values for the set
   members, apparently.
