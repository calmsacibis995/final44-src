Subject: Problem with compiling lisp on 4.3 beta for the tahoe
Index: ucb/lisp/lisp.tahoe/franz tahoe

The following piece of code was found in the file 
/usr/src/ucb/lisp/lisp.tahoe/franz/tahoe/Makefile
in the beta distribution of 4.3 for the CCI around line 96

This obviously doesn't work. 

(Now, what I want to know is what needed to be done to /lib/c2 to get lisp
to compile?)

In response to questions reguarding compiling LISP (Franz Opus 38.92):

	In the file /usr/src/ucb/lisp/ReadMe.tahoe, there an explanation
for the modifications to c2. The change involves basically removing the
"guts" of the "alloc()" function in /usr/src/lib/c2/c2.tahoe/c20.c, and
replacing them with a casted call to malloc(). I don't know why it doesn't
work as is, but for some reason if c2 is run but doesn't ever do any
malloc()'s (usually caused by fopen()), then the alloc() function dies.
If c2 is run with pipes at both ends, fopen() is never called.

	My advice is to first try removing the "~housel" in the Makefile
and seeing if it dumps core. If not, you're in luck. Otherwise, there are two
soloutions to this. The first is to apply the patch mentioned above to the
optimizer. The second is to replace the lines in the makefile with the
following:

	.c.o :
		@csh -cfe "echo cc -c  $*.c;\
		rm -f $*.o;\
		/lib/cpp $< -I../h |\
		/lib/ccom ${ProfFlag} | fixmask |\
		sed -f fixpbig.e >/tmp/lisp; \
		/lib/c2 /tmp/lisp | \
		as -o $*.o"

	This is a bit slower than through the pipes, but it works.

	Good luck, and enjoy!
