Subject: telnet problems when connecting to VMS hosts
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	There appears to be a problem with the client telnet program when used
to connect to our VMS hosts (running Wollongong 3.1 network software,
although others may be effected).  Output from most commands is garbled from
what appears to be occasional missing linefeeds.  Commands such as DIR
are effected.  

Repeat-By:
	Use /usr/ucb/telnet to connect to a VMS host running Wollongong network
software.  Issue simple commands such as DIR several times.  The output
of many of the DIR commands will be garbled.

Fix:
	The VMS machines seem to be somewhat unique in that they tend to
output a carrige return, and the pause for some time before sending a 
linefeed.  The telnet program handles this state differently than if the
cr and lf are received at the same time.  The problem appears to be a 
broken state machine in the decoding of incomming data.   

The code looks like this:

	@(#)telnet.c    1.2 (Berkeley) 9/25/87
	...
	telrcv()
	...
	        switch (telrcv_state) {
	
       		case TS_CR:
	            telrcv_state = TS_DATA;
	            if (c == '\0') {
	                break;  /* Ignore \0 after CR */
	            } else if (c == '\n') {
	                if ((!hisopts[TELOPT_ECHO]) && !crmod) {
	                    TTYADD(c);
	                }
	                break;
	            }

The patch I am running looks like this:

# diff telnet.c telnet.c.old
406c406
<               if ((hisopts[TELOPT_ECHO]) && !crmod) {
---
>               if ((!hisopts[TELOPT_ECHO]) && !crmod) {
