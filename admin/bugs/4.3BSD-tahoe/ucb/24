Subject: tn3270 doesn't process -t option argument properly
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	There's a code bug in main.c in the telnet source
	directory that only affects tn3270 (because of TN3270 #ifdef).
Repeat-By:
	Run tn3270, specifying any argument after the -t option. Escape
	to command mode with ^C and enter 'status' command. Reported
	transcom value will be '-t' rather than the value specified at
	invocation.
Fix:
	Use the right argv array index (2, rather than 1) in the main.c
	in the telnet source directory.
