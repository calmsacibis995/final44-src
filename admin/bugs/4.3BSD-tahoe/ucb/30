Subject: using "account xxx" in "ftp" can cause segmentation fault
Index: ucb/ftp/cmds.c tahoe

Description:
	On certain machines (in this case, a Sequent S81 -- i386-based),
	using the "account xxx" (giving an argument on the line) command in
	"ftp" will result in a segmentation fault (and core dumped).

Repeat-By:
	On a Sequent S81, enter "ftp localhost", get "logged" in, then type
	"account xxx".  You get notified that this command is not
	implemented, and then you get a segmentation fault.

Fix:
	The problem is that the character array "acct" is dimensioned at 50
	elements.  However, in the code to handle parsing arguments on the
	line with the "account" command (as in "account xxx"), you try to
	ensure NULL termination with "acct[50] = '\0';".  The "50" should
	really be a "49" since the array goes from 0 to 49.  This doesn't
	seem to affect many machines, but should probably be fixed anyway.

account(argc,argv)

	int argc;
	char **argv;
{
	char acct[50], *mygetpass(), *ap;

	if (argc > 1) {
		++argv;
		--argc;
		(void) strncpy(acct,*argv,49);
 >>>>>>		acct[50] = '\0';		<<<<<<< should be a 49
		while (argc > 1) {
			--argc;
			++argv;
			(void) strncat(acct,*argv, 49-strlen(acct));
		}
		ap = acct;
	}
