Subject: bug in netname routine in route.c (ucb/netstat/route.c)
Index: ucb/netstat tahoe 

Description:
	If the netname routine is passed a mask of 0 then it
	checks an unitialized register to see which mask to
	use.
Repeat-By:
	netstat -r couldn't find network 127 though it was
	in /etc/networks
Fix:
	Set the register.

< 	in.s_addr = ntohl(in.s_addr);
---
> 	i = in.s_addr = ntohl(in.s_addr);
