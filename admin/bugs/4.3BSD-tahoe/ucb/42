One of our users complained that when using "whois" he got the error message
	whois: nic.sri.com: host unknown
which is certainly a true statement.  (We advised him to do
	whois -h sri-nic.arpa user  )

Here is an explanation I got from the NIC.  You may want to update the
source of whois.c to reflect the new name.  By the way, nic.ddn.mil is 
a CNAME for sri-nic.arpa at this very moment.

NIC.SRI.COM is not a nickname for SRI-NIC.ARPA, and never will be.
Our official name will be NIC.DDN.MIL when the naming transition is
completed.  This is a government directive, and they do not want
NIC.SRI.COM as a nickname for our system.  The NIC.SRI.COM name is not
supported, and should not be a nickname. While Sun's whois software
may be correct, their use of the NIC.SRI.COM name is not.  If you need
a version of whois.c that has the correct name, you can get it on
SRI-NIC.ARPA in NETPROG:WHOIS.C.
