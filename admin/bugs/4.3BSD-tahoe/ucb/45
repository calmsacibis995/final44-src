Subject: Pascal 'MOD' operator problem on Tahoe machines
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The operands of the 'MOD' operator are evaluated twice on the
	tahoe. This causes problems when these operands have side-effects.
	(Calls to random number generators would be a good example.)

Repeat-By:
	Compile and run the following program on a Tahoe machine. Notice
	that more 'Gink!'s and 'Gonk!'s are printed than necessary or
	desired.

program munge(output);
	function gink : integer;
	begin
		writeln('Gink!');
		gink := 7;
	end;
	function gonk : integer;
	begin
		writeln('Gonk!');
		gonk := 3;
	end;
begin
	writeln(gink mod gonk);
end.

Fix:
	One way would be to remove the Tahoe-specific code in rdiv.c
	of the Pascal source, but according to the comments in the
	code this would break something else.
