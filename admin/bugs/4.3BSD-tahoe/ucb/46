I checked in the new rcp.c that you gave us last week into SunOS 4.1,
but thought that you might want to know about the problems we ran into.
The major one is that rcp of files with read-only protection gets the
error message:

sun-barr% rcp ishi:tmp/test .
rcp: can't truncate ./test: Permission denied
sun-barr% 

Does this work in vanilla BSD?  I submitted a bug report against our
ftruncate system call, but just commenting out the error message also
works.  The truncate only has any effect when the file has write
permission anyhow (or else the open would not work).

Here are some more trivial fixes I had to make:

rcp.c includes pathnames.h, but I could find no such file.  In fact,
I could not find the rcp.c program on our 4.3Tahoe tape.  Anyway, it looks
like the pathnames _PATH_RSH _PATH_CP and _PATH_BSHELL are supposed
to be defined there.

rcp.c includes string.h which in BSD includes strings.h, but ours
does not.  So I need to declare index() and rindex().

I removed the call to getservbynam() since this takes several seconds
of real time, and replaced it with a use of port = htons(IPPORT_CMDSERVER).

In SunOS signal functions return void instead of int.

In rdist, the variable tmpfile conflicts with the System V library
function of the same name.  We changed this to Tmpfile.

There were a couple null pointer checks in gram.y that could cause
core dumps (probably only on syntax errors):

121c126
<                               if (nl && nl->n_next != NULL)
---
>                               if (nl->n_next != NULL)
123,125c128,129
<                               $1->sc_name = nl ? nl->n_name: NULL;
<                               if (nl)
<                                       free(nl);
---
>                               $1->sc_name = nl->n_name;
>                               free(nl);

Just in case you are interested.
