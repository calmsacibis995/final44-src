Subject: vi: wrapmargin bug, properly repeat 'p' or 'P' commands
#Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe 4.3BSD 2BSD
Index: ucb/ex 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	After my recent fix of the wrapmargin bug, a previously hidden
	problem is revealed: to properly repeat 'p' or 'P' commands
	when using the unnamed buffer.
Repeat-By:
	yank two words with no named buffer: 'y2w', then
	move somewhere and 'p' put them.  Then hit '.' to 
	do it again and see what doesn't happen.  Also present
	on sysV/386 Rel 3.2.1
Fix:

	Move the call to setLAST() in the 'P' section of
	ex_vmain.c up a few lines so it can save the
	unnamed buffer commands as well.
