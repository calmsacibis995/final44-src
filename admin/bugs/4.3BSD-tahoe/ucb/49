Subject: ucb Mail (mailx for System V) bug


Problem:

Mail crashes when processing an 'alias' command (in the .mailrc file) that is
slightly greater than BUFSIZ bytes *and* uses continuation lines (end preceding 
line with backslash).

Systems:  

4.3BSD, 4.3-tahoe
System V, Release 2 and 3
SunOS 4.0.{0,1,3} 
(probably any Unix system derived from 4.XBSD and System V)


Caveat:  

Using continuation lines in the .mailrc is not in the man page but the code
supports it (well, almost:-) and it's "common" practice.

Slightly more detailed description:

When reading one's .mailrc file and encountering an 'alias' command,
commands() (lex.c)  calls readline() (fio.c) for each line of input
from the file (this includes individual continuation lines).   A check is made
that the line read is not greater than the size of the input buffer (LINESIZE =
BUFSIZ = (usually) 1024).  The problem is that the input line as a whole (the 
sum of the continuation lines) is not checked against LINESIZE, just each 
individual line (from the file) is checked.

Thus, if the alias command "line" is slightly greater than LINESIZE, nasty
things happen, like the stack gets blown away.


Fix:  

(for the SunOS 4.0 Mail, derived from System V Release 2 mailx,
this will not work for the 4.3BSD Mail because readline() has
been changed to use fgets(3))

A possible (but  kludgey) fix is to add another parameter to readline() 
which is a char ptr (or just use the input array, itself) pointing to the 
*start* of the input buffer.  And then use it to check (in readline()) 
against the current input position to see if the buffer is "full".  
Also, the input buffer should probably be increased to allow bigger
aliases.
