Fix:
There are two problems.  The first problem is that cathy didn't
make it into the list at all.  The second is that the ken address
is messed up.  It tried to add the sender's domain since ken didn't
have a domain but it did it incorrectly.  Instead of ken@sub.domain
it came out as sub.ken@domain.

The first problem is a problem with the skin() code in aux.c.  There seems 
to be an implicit assumption there that all of the addresses will be rfc 822
style if any of them are.  When it runs into the "<" it throws out everything
before that, including cathy@other.domain which should have been saved since
it came before the ",".

The second problem comes from some strange mucking about in optim.c, in the
arpafix() routine.  I don't pretend to understand what is supposed to be
happening there.
