A message is sent from <user@astro.ucla.edu> to <chang@math.ucla.edu>.
The recipient Replies (upper case) to it so that the reply message is
sent to all recipients of the original, namely <user@astro.ucla.edu>
and <chang> (as appearing in the original after landing at Math).  
However, /usr/ucb/mail produces and displays "To: chang@astro.ucla.edu,
user@astro.ucla.edu", and this is no lie because the message is actually
sent to <chang@astro.ucla.edu>.  Behavior is the same with and without
onehop set.  

(The reason we only started seeing this now is that the new sendmail.cf
strips local machine names from local addresses while before the message
would have been to <chang@sonia>, foiling the bug.  We are using
sendmail v5.59 with a locally generated sendmail.cf.)
