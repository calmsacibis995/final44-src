Subject: finger.c control character mask
Index: ucb/finger 4.3BSD-tahoe


Description:
	finger.c attempts to mask control characters using an
	exclusive or with the constant 100.  The problem is that this
	constant really should be 0100, i.e. octal 100, not decimal
	100.

Repeat-By:
	Take a look at the code.

Fix:
	Patch below.

P.S. It's remarkable that this bug has been around for so long.  The
     funny thing is that most of the time, this will work just fine
     (or almost just fine), since decimal 100 has the seventh bit set,
     which isd the purpose of 0100.  However, characters will get
     distorted in strange ways because 100 decimal also has the sixth
     and third bits set.
