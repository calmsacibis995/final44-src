Description:
	The SunOS 4.0.3 "fmt" manual page notes that
		fmt does not fill lines beginning with `.',
		for compatibility with nroff(1).
	While fmt indeed does not fill such lines, it will split them;
	this results in nroff incompatibilities.

Fix:
If your version of "fmt.c" is sufficiently similar to the 4.3BSD version:
		*** 1.1/ucb/Mail/fmt.c	Thu Mar  8 15:02:40 1990
		--- 1.2/ucb/Mail/fmt.c	Thu Mar  8 15:02:40 1990
