Subject: rlogin should propagate DISPLAY
Date: Thu, 12 Apr 90 16:10:46 EDT
From: Stephen Gildea <gildea@alexander.bbn.com>
Index: ucb/rlogin 4.3BSD-tahoe

The rlogin program (BSD 4.3, etc.) sets the TERM environment
variable on the remote system from the local system.  This is good,
but as network-based systems become more common, other variables
should be propagated, also.  One that springs to mind is DISPLAY.
There should be a general mechanism for propagating variables--rather
than the special hack for TERM that exists now--so that additional
variables can be added in the future in a compatible way.
