Subject: /usr/ucb/mail botches some return addresses 
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	Given a message with a mix of relative and fully-qualified addresses,
	/usr/ucb/mail will apply parts of the fully-qualified domain name to
	the relative recipients.
Repeat-By:
	Given a message like the following:

	From bscheid Wed Jun  6 16:13:06 1990
	Date: Wed, 6 Jun 90 16:12:58 -0500
	From: Beth Scheid <bscheid@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu>
	To: krol
	Subject: TCP Product
	Cc: andys, bscheid, german

	(text deleted)

	Using the 'r' (reply) command creates the following:

	To: ux1.uiuc:krol@edu bscheid@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu
	Subject: TCP Product
	Cc: ux1.uiuc:andys@edu ux1.uiuc:bscheid@edu ux1.uiuc:german@edu
Fix:
	The cause is that "." is being used as one of the address separators.
	My guess that this is a holdover from the BerkNet days.  The fix is
	to eliminate "." from the list of separators in config.c.  Apply the
	following patch and re-compile:
