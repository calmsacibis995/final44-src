Subject: grep -b prints bogus block numbers
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	According to the manual of grep, grep -b should print any
	matches it finds preceded by the block number.  There are
	several different versions of grep, fgrep, and egrep, and they
	give differing results.
	By the way, it isn't clear from the manual what the size of the
	blocks are supposed to be, but I suppose since all blocks are
	1K, that these blocks should also be 1K.
Repeat-By:
	The following typescript shows it all.
