Subject: Prompting users for "Cc:" in Mail after message composed is confusing
Index: ucb 4.3BSD-tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If the "askcc" flag is set, "Mail" will, after you've finished
	composing the body of a message and typed "." or ^D, prompt you
	for a list of carbon-copy recipients.

	A lot of users unfamiliar with this behavior will think that if
	they type "." at this point, "Mail" will send their message off.
	Well, they're right, in a sense, *but* it will also attempt to
	send a carbon copy to user ".", and probably fail.

	Either "askcc" should ask at a more opportune point, such as
	after "Mail" asks for a subject and *before* you compose the
	message, or a new option that does that should be provided.
Repeat-By:
	Arrange that "askcc" is set on a lot of accounts used by
	people not familiar with this quirk, and watch the bounce
	messages pile up in the postmaster's mailbox(es).
Fix:
