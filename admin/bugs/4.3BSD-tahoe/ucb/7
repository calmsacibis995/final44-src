Subject: Signed constants are not handled by pc
Index: ucb/pascal tahoe

Description:
	Signed constants are not handled by pc
Repeat-By:
	See following program.  Signed constants are not being kept
	along with the sign, and a large positive number is pushed on
	the stack instead.

	Note that pi and px handle this situation properly
Fix:
	Remember the sign in the symbol table for constants.

Source:
	
program test (input, output);

{There seems to be a problem with pc's handling of negative constants.
When they are assigned to an integer they are not sign extended.
Here is a sample program.
}

const
 TEST  = -1;

var 
val	: integer;

procedure testval (value:integer);

begin
writeln (output, 'testval: ', value);
end;

begin

writeln (output, 'Mainline: ', TEST);
testval (-1);
testval (TEST);
val := TEST;
testval(val);

end.
