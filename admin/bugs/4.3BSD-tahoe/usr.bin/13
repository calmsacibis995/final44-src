Subject: rdist bug
Index: usr.bin/rdist tahoe

I don't know if this is the right place to report this bug, but here goes:

The following rdist file causes a syntax error due to the = character
in the filename. It goes away if I substitute f.ex # for the =

floorplans:
	floorplans -> eros
	install /eros14/rwb/lars/=PROC/floorplans;
	except_pat (\\.o\$ \\.log\$  ~\$);
	except_pat (/structure_master\$  /structure_instance\$  /physical\$);
	except_pat (/symbolic\$);

Apparently, rdist thinks that it is seeing an assignment.
It you backslash the = character, it does nothing at all
