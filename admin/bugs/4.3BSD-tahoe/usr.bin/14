Sun-Software-Release-Number:
	SunOS 4.0 + "General-Hy patch"

Description:
	In addition to the previously reported (to Sun) munging of links to
	the /etc/passwd file by the "vipw" command, the "chfn", "chsh", and
	"chgrp" commands also munge such links.  This is true on both
	SunOS 4.0 and MORE/bsd 4.3.
