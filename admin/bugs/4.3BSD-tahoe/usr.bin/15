Subject: 4.3 Tahoe w(1) and uptime(1) bug
Index: usr.bin/w tahoe


The following bug is present in 4.3 and 4.3 Tahoe code for the w (and
uptime, since they're the same binary) programs.

SYNOPSIS:
	When the program prints out the number of users, it tries to
	decide whether to use "users" or "user" by checking if the
	number of users is greater than one.  As a result, if the
	number of users is zero it will say "0 user," which is
	incorrect.  It should say "0 users."

FIX:
	Apply the following context diff patch to w.c.

  		rewind(ut);
