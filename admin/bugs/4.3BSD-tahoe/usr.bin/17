Description:
You are doubtless aware of the two different forms of From: lines

    From: $?x$x <$g>$|$g$.
and From: $g $?x($x)$.

infamous for the mistake in the first in Eric Allman's documentation
(he required the '<' '>', while 822 explicitly prohibits them unless
the comment text $x is there.)

This format is required for all mailboxes.

Slightly less obvious is that it is impossible to use "new" format
ie comma seperated addresses, in any case other than the "$x <$g>"
case if there is any possibility of the address being formatted as
an 822 source route...

       @aaa,@bbb,@ccc:user@ddd

--- 3 comma seperated recipients, the first 2 with null mailboxes?
this is a consequence of the code in prescan.

This raises the interesting question of parsing a recipient list
such as:

     To:   @aaa,@bbb,@ccc:user@ddd,@www,@xxx,@yyy:user2@zzz,u3@mmm

which is noted with a flying side-swipe in the comments in the UK2.1
configuration package.   The fixes appended to this message cure the problem,
(and I hope fix the problems noted in UK2.1 --- perhaps the authors
will let us know?).
