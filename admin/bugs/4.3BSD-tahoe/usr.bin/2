Subject: (di)troff handles -o option badly
Index: usr.bin tahoe

Description:
	troff or ditroff handles the -o option in a rather primitive way.
	After the call  troff -o235-312  , if the first page number is 236,
	nothing gets printed (but hours of CPU time are wasted).
	In other words, -o235-312 does:
	  when you see page 235, start printing; when you have completed
	  page 312, stop printing,
	instead of what one might expect from the description in the manual:
	  print all pages with a page number between 235 and 312 (inclusive).
Repeat-By:
	Inspect the source (n7.c) or try it (troff -o235-312 -n236 file).
Fix:
	Add half a line in n7.c:
	[This applies to all versions of troff I have seen. The line numbers
	below apply to one particular (already hacked) version.
	What is called  numtab[PN].val  below (for ditroff)
	is called  v.pn  in de source of troff.]
