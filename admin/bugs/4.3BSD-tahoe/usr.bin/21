Subject: tbl core dumps

Index: usr.bin/tbl/t8.c 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	tbl sometimes core dumps due to an uninitialised variable.

Repeat-by:
	Difficult.  The file I hvae that does it is 29223 bytes long,
	and may depend on the C library as well (since the bug depends
	on exactly what stack trash is around).

Fix:
	This has been tested and appears to work, but was largely
	a WAG, and may not be the correct fix.
