Subject: nroff -o option: trailing hyphen action broken
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	A trailing hyphen in the nroff -o option is supposed
	to cause printing from the preceding page number to the end
	of the file.  For example, -o7- should print from page 7
	to the end.  Instead page 7 is printed but nothing more.

Repeat-By:
	Use any typical input file that generates more than
	one page; run nroff with "-o1-" which should print from
	page 1 to the end.

		nroff -o1- file
	
	Only page 1 will be printed.
Fix:
	A recent revision to n7.c (revision 4.3) introduced the
	problem with the trailing hyphen.  The modifications shown
	below restore proper functioning of a trailing hyphen in
	the -o option.

	The code in n7.c that pertains to the -o option contained
	extraneous steps which were apparently left over from an
	earlier stage of evolution.  These modifications eliminate
	those steps and make the code a little easier to follow.

	All the values stored in the page number list are positive except
	for -1 which means quit and -2 which means continue printing to
	the end of the file.  The faulty version of n7.c doesn't handle
	the -2 value properly.
