Subject: tbl dumps core
Index: usr.bin/tbl 4.3BSD-tahoe

Hello Keith,
 
I would like to submit a bug report for BSD UNIX, but I'm not yet a member
of any newsgroup -- and due to other demands on my time, I'm not likely
to be for awhile yet.  So I need a proxy to submit this report to the
appropriate software group.  Inasmuch as you seem to have been in charge
of BSD bug reports, you are the logical choice.
 
Would you play this role for me?  The bug is several years old, recorded 
back when I still had access to BSD code.  On the other hand, I very much 
doubt that it's been fixed in the meantime.

tbl dumps core on the input
 
    .TS  
    tab (#);
    l l    
    ^ _
    l l .
    data#data
    data#data
    data#data
    .TE  
 
This table specification is extracted from a larger example in which the
indicated construction would have been very useful.  (This bug could be
fixed in 4.3BSD tbl by the following change.  In the source file t5.c,
immediately before the source line
 
    nlin++;
 
add the line
 
    table[nlin] = (struct colstr *)alocv((ncol+2)*sizeof(table[0][0]));
 
[just a copy of the line found a few lines down], so this table structure
pointer is initialized before the program skips to the next one.)
