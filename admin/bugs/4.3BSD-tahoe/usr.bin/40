After starting a flame war (whine war?) about the upgrade process, I began
to feel a little guilty because I have learned and received so much from
this group and have given nothing in return (probably for fear of being
flamed by Andy).
   I fixed a bug in indent that someone else brought to my attention.
When -bl processing is turned on, this input causes indent to hiccup:
main()
{
	if(test)  nothing;
	else	/* comment */
	{
		nothing;	/* comment */
	}
}
Well, andy and indent.pro specify -br processing, and that is a somewhat
unlikely place to put a comment, but a bug is a bug.  What happens is that
when indent finds the left brace after the first comment, the code falls
through into the comment case, seen in the cdiff below.

The following cdiff fixes this problem:
*** indent/indent.c	Wed Mar 14 21:21:08 1990
--- newindent/indent.c	Fri Mar 30 20:46:39 1990
***************
*** 314,317 ****
--- 314,326 ----
  					   of this loop */
  	    }
+ /*
+  * Something is buffered up in save_com, and -bl processing is in effect.
+  * Add the brace after the comment so it will come out on the next line.
+  */
+ 	    flushed_nl = 0;	/* comment can start on the same line */
+ 	    *sc_end++ = '\n';	/* break line after comment */
+ 	    *sc_end++ = '{';
+ 	    goto sw_buffer;
+ 
  	 case comment:			/* we have a comment, so we
  					   must copy it into the buffer */

Please do not complain about the goto.  There are 8 more in indent.c to keep
it company.
Indent is great.  It is the correct antidote to any heated discussion about
coding style.  Thanks to Robert Hall for posting it.
