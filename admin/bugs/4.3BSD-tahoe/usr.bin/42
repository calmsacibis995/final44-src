     Hi.  I discovered a bug in dbx, which appears to exist in both 4.3BSD and
the latest 4.4BSD beta that we have at Wisconsin.

     dbx allows the ">=" operator to be used when specifying conditions, e.g.:

		stop in myproc if x >= 5

     Unfortunately, the routine eval() in eval.c is unable to evaluate the
resulting parse tree, because "case O_GE:" is missing from the switch(p->op).

     When the program being debugged is run, the following message results:

		dbx: internal error: eval: bad op 32

where (O_GE == 32).

     The fix should be straightforward -- simply add a case for "O_GE" along
with the appropriate binary test.

     Thanks.
