Description:
	The new and improved AT&T-free fmt has a different way of
	specifying the desired width. This leads to interesting
	problems when switching from the old to the new version.

Repeat-By:
	Try to format a text file to 80 columns using the old syntax
	with the new program:

	    vangogh 17 % echo "I've tripped and I can't get down." | fmt -80 
	    I've
	    tripped
	    and
	    I
	    can't
	    get
	    down.
	
	Note that each word is on a line by itself. Another problem
	with this syntax is that you can't fmt files that have all
	numeric names:

	    vangogh 28 % cat > 70
	    I'm totally stumped, Bob!  Back to square one!
	    ^D
	    vangogh 29 % fmt 70
	    ^D
	    vangogh 30 % 
	
	Note that fmt ignores the file and tries to read from stdin.

Fix:
	Change fmt to require a leading dash (or at the very least make
	it optional it).
