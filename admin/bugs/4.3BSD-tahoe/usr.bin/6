Subject: yacc error handling is incorrect

Index: usr.bin/yacc/y3.c 4.3BSD-tahoe Fix

Description:
	Yacc states that should default to `error' instead default
	to a reduction.  (From usenet comp.compilers)

Repeat-by:
	Run `yacc -d' over the following grammar:

		%token a
		%%
		s: oseq;
		oseq: /* empty */ | oseq a | oseq error;

	Examine y.output state 2.  It should reduce by 1 on end,
	shift to 4 on error, shift to 3 on a, and otherwise be an
	error.  Instead, it shifts to 4 on error, shifts to 3 on a,
	and otherwise reduces by 1.

Fix:
	The `error' token is token number 2, not 1: 1 is $eof; hence
	the diff below.  It would also be helpful to have y2.c check
	that defin() returns 1 for $eof, 2 for error, and (I suppose)
	NTBASE+1 for $accept (not 3: $accept is a nonterminal).
