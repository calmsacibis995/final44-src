Subject: Casting problem causes sendmail 5.61 to dump core
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/daemon.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	Sendmail will dump core (at least on my machines) if the load
	average goes above RefuseLA, due to an "Illegal Instruction."
	The problem I see is that the call to setproctitle("...%2f",la)
	(with la as an int) does not properly normalize 'la' to a floating
	point number and when doprnt calls the cvt routines, I dump core.
Repeat-By:
	Cause load average to go above RefuseLA and see if sendmail dumps
	core.
Fix:
