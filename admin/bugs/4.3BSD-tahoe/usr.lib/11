Subject: sendmail v5.61 report of load average in process title is wrong
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/daemon.c 4.3BSD-tahoe
Date: Wed, 04 Apr 90 12:58:01 EDT
From: Mark Litwack <litwack@operations.dccs.upenn.edu>

Description:
	When the OX (load average for accepting connections) gets too high,
	sendmail sets it's process title to this:

		rejecting connections: load average: 0.00

	It's always 0.00, no matter what the load average is.

Repeat-By:
	Get the load average above OX and look at the process title.

Fix:
	5 second fix: the format of the call to setproctitle is wrong.
	Change from:

		setproctitle("rejecting connections: load average: %.2f", la);

	To:

		setproctitle("rejecting connections: load average: %d", la);

	in daemon.c.  "la" is an integer, not a floating point.
