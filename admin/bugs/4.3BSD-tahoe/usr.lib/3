Subject: exp(3m) fails for certain numbers
Index: usr.lib tahoe

Description:
	exp(-1e-19) causes a core dump
Repeat-By:
	Try to compile the following code fragment.

main()
{
	double d = exp(-1e-19);
}

	The problem seems to be in two places. When looking at the problem
with adb, I notice that the results at the stated location and the ach and
acl specified in adb of the following operand 

	std	ffffffc4(fp)

were different. I also traced down the problem to such a store instruction
produced around lines 109 and 110 in /usr/src/usr.lib/libm/exp.c

			z += exp__E(z,c);
			return (scalb(z+1.0,k));  

The return from exp__E is wrong (r0 and r1 contain 0x8000000 and 0x0 respectively)
but exp__E seem to be passed the wrong thing as well which can be traced to
a "std" that seems to store the wrong thing in memory, at least w.r.t. to
what adb says the accumulator is.
