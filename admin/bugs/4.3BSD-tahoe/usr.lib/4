Subject: 4.3BSD-tahoe: lpd gives bogus width fields to input filters
Index: usr.lib/lpr 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	As distributed, the lpd code which forks off input filters will
	usually pass a bogus zero width as an argument to the filter.

Repeat-By:
	Create a filter which displays its arguments onto some file or
terminal, set up a printer with :pw#xxx: in the printcap, and notice
that the page width specified becomes zero before being passed to the
filter.
	Note that user-specified widths (lpr -wxxx) still work properly.
Fix:
	printjob.c has a bogus strcpy() which fills in "0" for the width
	field, overwriting the values specified in the printcap file.
