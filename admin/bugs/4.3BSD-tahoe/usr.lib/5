Subject: 4.3BSD "curses" bug
Index: usr.lib/libcurses 4.3BSD-tahoe

Greg Minshall found what turned out, I think, to be a bug in the 4.3BSD
"curses" that causes it to output characters with their 8th bit set. 
This isn't a problem with the 4.xBSD tty driver, since except in RAW or
LITOUT mode it strips the characters to 7 bits; however, under the SunOS
4.0 tty driver, those 8-bit characters come out, and if you're in a
SunOS 4.0 "shelltool" without an 8-bit font, the tty subwindow code does
all sorts of weird shit (puts characters at bizarre places on the screen
not neatly aligned on character frame boundaries). 

I *think* the problem is here - if (i&_STANDOUT) is true, the character
has its 8th bit set (_STANDOUT is 0200), and if the tube is currently in
standout mode ((curscr->_flags&_STANDOUT) is true), it pumps that 8-bit
character out.

If the bug is what and where I think it is, this is the fix to the
4.3BSD version of "cr_put.c"; the same fix should apply to the SunOS
4.0/4.1 and 4.3-tahoe versions, except for the line numbers (but you all
have "patch", so that's not a problem, right?).  It should be fixed both
in SunOS 4.x and 4.xBSD (especially given the new POSIX tty driver for
4.x, which shouldn't strip output to 7 bits either).
