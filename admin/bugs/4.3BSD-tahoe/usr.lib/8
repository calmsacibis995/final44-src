Subject: #includes out of order in sendmail.h file
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/sendmail.h tahoe

Description:
	EX_CONFIG is defined in ./conf.h if it isn't already.  In the Tahoe
	release, EX_CONFIG is also defined in /usr/include/sysexits.h.
	The problem arises when <sysexits.h> is included after "conf.h".
Repeat-By:
	Do a make depend
Fix:
	Edit sendmail.h and move the #include <sysexits.h> from line 623
	or so, up above #include "conf.h".
