Subject: routed bug
Index: usr.sbin/routed tahoe

The routed/startup.c on the BSD networking tape has a small bug.  It assumes
that the interface flags do not use any of the bits used internally by routed.
This is not true for all vendors.  Thus vendor flags conflict with routed
internal flags.  This is fixed by masking don't-care flags out of the results
returned from the kernel.
