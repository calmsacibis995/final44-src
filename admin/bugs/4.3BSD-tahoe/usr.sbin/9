I just discovered, to my wonder and chagrin, that inetd has a hard-coded
limit of 4 arguments to the server.  This seems ludicrous, and I'll be
somewhat hard-pressed to get around this limitation.  Is there any
reasonable justification for this?  Is it likely to get fixed?

There is no documentation of this fact, in either inetd(8) or
inetd.conf(5).

This is in Berkeley's inetd, but has propagated to SunOS.  Probably to AIX
and others as well.
