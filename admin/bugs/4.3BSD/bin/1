Subject: Ls does not allow sorting by file size
Index: 	bin/ls.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Ls does not have an option to sort files by size.  In addition,
	the -f flag (list files in the order they occur in the directory),
	for some strange reason turns off -l and -s flags.  This makes
	absolutely no sense, and does not seem to have any reason behind it.
	It does make it impossible to get (for example) a long listing (-l)
	of the files in the directory in the order they are in the directory,
	a perfectly reasonable operation.

	The following modification adds the -S (sort by size) flag and
	makes -f turn off ONLY -S and -t (sorting) flags.  The -f flag
	modification consists only of changing line 141, as indicated
	by the comment.

>>>>> Comment <<<<<

There's no pressing need to give ls another flag, especially one
that sorts on size.  Besides, "ls -l | sort -n +3" does it, if
you really need to do so.

The reason that -f turns off -l and -s is that -f is designed
to work with:
	cp /etc foo;
	ls -f foo;

Therefore, the values given with the -l and the -s flags, found
through a stat of the "file", are meaningless.
