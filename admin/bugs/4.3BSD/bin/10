Subject: "write" failed to exit correctly.

Index:	bin/write 4.3BSD

Description:
	"write" failed to exit when sent end-of-file, interrupt,
	and quit.  Was finally killed with a "stop" and then a
	terminate signal.  The problem occurred twice.  I was writing
	to a user who seemed (according to "w") to be "rlogin'ed"
	to a remote machine.  The write was, however, local.
	The user did not write back.  Writing to myself worked
	as expected.  The signals were echoed (^D, ^?, ^\).
Repeat-By:
	Try:  % write some_user
	      blah blah blah
	      ^D
	
	Good luck: the problem is most likely not with write itself.
