SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
    sed deletes last line if not newline terminated

Operating System:       4.2 BSD

MODULE NAME:
    sed
BUG PORTED TO UTX?
    
DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
    Like a whole lot of UNIX programs, sed does not handle the last line 
    of a file correctly if it does not end in '\n'. While this is well
    known behaviour, it's not really acceptable.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
    Script started on Sun Apr 13 17:13:42 1986
    csh aglew mycroft /tmp/aglew/sed 25 : !sed
    sed -e '1,$s/a/A/g' > ! k

    ^Dcsh aglew mycroft /tmp/aglew/sed 26 : p k
    hjgjhgur5y
    hjgghjgjh
    csh aglew mycroft /tmp/aglew/sed 27 : !sed
    sed -e '1,$s/a/A/g' > ! k

    csh aglew mycroft /tmp/aglew/sed 29 : off
    csh aglew mycroft /tmp/aglew/sed 30 :

    script done on Sun Apr 13 17:14:54 1986

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
    
SUGGESTED FIX:
    In gline() of sed1.c.
