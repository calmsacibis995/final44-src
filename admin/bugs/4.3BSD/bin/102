SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	Shell globbing busted for weird case.

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:

BUG PORTED TO UTX? yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	The use of quote characters in a shell "word" seems
	to turn off wildcard expansion for the rest of the
	word.  Sometimes.

	This happens in both the csh and sh (in slightly 
	different ways).

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
FANG-1% csh
FANG-1% echo "/etc/"passwd
/etc/passwd
FANG-2% echo "/etc/"*
echo: No match.
FANG-3% echo "/etc"/*
/etc/DWtime ...
FANG-4% echo "/etc/"/*
/etc//DWtime ...
FANG-6% sh
$ echo "/etc/"passwd
/etc/passwd
$ echo "/etc/"*
/etc/*
$ echo "/etc"/*
/etc/*
$ echo "/etc/"/*
/etc//*
$ 
HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
