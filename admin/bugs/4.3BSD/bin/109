Subject: commands fail if an Environment var name has minus
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD
#Index: man, ranlib, environment, minus, -, 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a user defines an environment variable that contains a minus sign,
	(-), some 4.3 commands will fail.
Repeat-By:
	% setenv X-Y xxx
	% man tar
	X-Y=xxx: is not an identifier
Fix:
	Document restriction on Environment variables is one (not very nice)
	fix.  I don't know why this happens or how to really fix it.
