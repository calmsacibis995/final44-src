Subject: Failed logins by users with 8 character long names mess up syslog
Index:	bin/login.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When users with a name that is 8 characters long fail to login
	the message passed to syslog is incorrect because the utmp.ut_name
	is NOT '\0' terminated, part or all of the utmp.ut_host is printed
	also.
Repeat-By:
	Try to rlogin as some nonexsistant user and have login fail after
	5 tries. Look in /usr/adm/messages (or wherever syslog is told
	to send such messages) and you will see an entry like:
	REPEATED LOGIN FAILURES ttyp0, sillytryucbvax

Fix:
	The fix is easy change a %s to %.8s as shown below. I also added
	the ut_host part as it is nice to know from which machine a rlogin
	attempt was made from.
