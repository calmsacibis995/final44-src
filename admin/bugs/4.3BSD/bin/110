Subject: silliness: ls options -c and -u require -t option
Index: bin/ls.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The ls options -c and -u require that the -t option also be
	specified.  This is somewhat silly.
Repeat-By:
	Try "ls -c", "ls -lc", etc. and notice that the only way to get
	the -c or -u options to work is in combination with the -t flag
	(why not call them the -ct and -ut flags? :-)).

Description:
	Ignore that previous bug report and fix.  If you apply the fix I
	gave which causes ls to automatically assume -t whenever -c or -u are
	given, you can never get an alphabetic listing with the creation
	times shown (-lc), for example.

	Just apply the following fix which clarifies the manual page instead.
