Subject: csh {,} question
Index: bin/csh/sh.glob.c 4.3BSD

The {,} abbreviation construct in the C shell doesn't allow commas to
be escaped with backslashes, but instead insists on treating them as if
they hadn't been escaped.  The function execbrc in sh.glob.c contains
explicit code for enforcing this behavior:

	case ','|QUOTE:
	case ',':

Commenting out the first of these two lines causes the shell to honor
backslashed commas in this construct.

However, I'm worried about what else this change might break -- presumably
this case is there for a reason.  Are there any csh experts available
up at Berkeley that could cast some light on this?

Thanks a lot.

You may recall my sending you mail asking whether anybody at UCB could
come up with a reason for not removing a line from the execbrc function
of sh.glob.c in the C shell sources that prevented backslash from
escaping commas in the {,} construct.

I've checked with Bill Joy about this, and he can't remember any reason
why the offending line should be there, and in fact thinks it's a bug.

Therefore I've installed the fix in our sources and suggest that you
do the same in yours.  The fix is simple -- remove the line reading
	case ','|QUOTE:
from the function execbrc of sh.glob.c.
