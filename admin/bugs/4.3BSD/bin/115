Subject: Bug involving csh and the "source" command
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

When executing any program by using "source filenm", typing ^Z results in the
terminal locking up.  This doesn't happen if the program is executed directly
from the csh and it didn't happen yesterday.

Also, typing ^Z to any process now results in the messaged "suspended" instead
of "stopped", which is what it used to be.  

An easy test: make a file named test with the line: "sleep 60".
Type "source test".
Type ^Z
