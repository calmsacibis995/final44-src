Subject: sed wfiles limit wrong

Index:	src/bin/sed/sed0.c  (Sun UNIX version 3.4, 4.3BSD)

Description:
	sed's documented limit of 10 files for the w command is
	really only 9.  Evidently this is a somewhat-well-known
	bug, but *I* didn't know about it...

Repeat-By:
	sed -e '/1/w 1' -e '/2/w 2' -e '/3/w 3' -e '/4/w 4' -e '/5/w 5' -e \
	'/6/w 6' -e '/7/w 7' -e '/8/w 8' -e '/9/w 9' -e '/10/w 10'
Fix:
	Change the declaration of fname and the test "nfiles >= 10" (or
	start nfiles at 0).
