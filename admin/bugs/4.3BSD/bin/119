Subject: ls(1) manpage misleading
Index: bin/ls.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The description of the behavior of "ls -F" is not complete enough wrt
	symbolic links.  The manual page claims that symbolic links are marked
	with a trailing '@', which is true except for symbolic links that point
	to a directory.
Repeat-By:
	% ln -s /bin foo
	% ls -F

	note that "foo/" shows up instead of "foo@".  The behavior of ls is
	correct but the man page is a little misleading.

Fix: diffs for /usr/man/man1/ls.1

	101,102c101,103
	< symbolic links with a trailing `@', and executable
	< files with a trailing `*'.

	> to directories, which are marked with `/'),
	> and executable files with a trailing `*'.
