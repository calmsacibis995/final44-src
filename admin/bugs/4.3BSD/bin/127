Subject: yet another csh bug and fix
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Hi folks,

With the utmost humidity and hoping not to be a nuance I herewith
adventure to percent a new fix for an old bug of csh.

Symptoms:

	There is an 4bsd undocumented feature of history mechanism in csh.
	With !# you can get the whole last command.
	When you try
		alias a '\!#'
		b;a
	the csh will take a loooooooong time. Quite probably it will dump
	core. It is not neccessary for b to have any special value or
	even to exist.

Diagnosis:

	When doing the alias substitution a new command line is built
	substituting the old command line in place of 'a'. Then this line
	is searched for candidates for alias substitution. The new 'a' at
	the end of the new line is found, and alias substitution happens.
	Old 'a's are marked, so 'a;b' does not produce garbage.
	In our example the line grows with each alias substitution:

	b;a
	b;b;a
	b;b;b;b;b;a
	...

	In short, let l0 = 4 (end-of-wordlist counts !), then 
	ln = 2^n * (l0-2) + 2 is the number of words in the input list
	after n substitutions.

	csh does only 20 alias substitutions (or is it 21 ?), but after
	that time the number of words is 2.097.154. And it takes a long
	time to reach this result.

Therapy:

	Firstly, add a line to sh.local.h defining MAX_PARAMS, the maximal
	number of words in the input while alias substituting.
		Example:
			#define MAX_PARAMS	2000
	2000 is a value I seem to find quite sufficient.

	Secondly, apply the following context diff.

*** sh.parse.c.old	Thu Mar 24 13:55:12 1988
--- sh.parse.c	Thu Mar 24 13:55:11 1988
***************
*** 34,43 ****
--- 34,67 ----
  	resexit(osetexit);
  }
+ static int
+ too_long (p1, p2)
+ 	register struct wordent *p1, *p2;
+ /*
+  * 15.jan.88  mg
+  * it was possible to get csh into an endless loop.
+  * Just type : alias a '\!#'  then  b; a
+  * Diagnosis : the alias routine substitute the command to "b;!#"
+  * then lex is called, which substitutes "b;b;a". The alias routines
+  * continue to run on the wordlist, but it gets longer each time, so
+  * an end is only reached when the list is 2**21 + 2 entries long, and
+  * this take long and needs a lot of memory.
+  * This routines here counts the number of words in the list.
+  * Maximum number of 2000 should be sufficient.
+  */
+ {
+ 	register int i;
+ 
+ 	for (i=0; p1!=p2 && i<MAX_PARAMS; i++, p1=p1->next);
+ 	return (i<MAX_PARAMS ? 0 : 1);
+ }
+ 
  asyntax(p1, p2)
  	register struct wordent *p1, *p2;
  {
+ 	if (too_long(p1,p2))
+ 		error ("Infinite alias substitution loop detected");
  	while (p1 != p2)
  		if (any(p1->word[0], ";&\n"))
  			p1 = p1->next;

Absorb, apply and enjoy,

		Michael

	whoa! quick comment time... I'm running 4.3 BSD on a Vax 11/750,
and Sun 4.2 R3.5 on various Suns. The use of "!#" is "the command line
typed in so far..." very useful for things like renaming files via:

	mv longfilename.c really!#:1

	which gives you "reallylongfilename.c". I've never had to use
things like "!#:2-4", but that's possible, as well as:

	"echo this is !#:1:s/is/at"

	For more clarification (This is *not* "the last command", at least
on the versions I mentioned...), see "The C Shell Field Guide" by Gail
& Paul Anderson. I hope this averts some confusion among csh users
reading this :-)
