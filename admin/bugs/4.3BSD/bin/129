SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Don't type on this line)
	Bug in csh

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	The file sh.c in csh has the following code:

		nofile = open (.....);
		if (nofile < 0)
		    stuff
	
	but nofile is an unsigned number, so the error is never
	taken.  (Also, nofile is defined as a "bool", and putting an
	int into it is naughty.)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
