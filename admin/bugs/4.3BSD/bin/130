SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Don't type on this line)
	sh doesn't check properly for signals

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	The shell's "readb" routine checks for a signal in the wrong
	order.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
	Try this script:

	    trap "echo trap entered;exit 0" 1 2 3 4 5
	    echo -n "enter number "
	    read var
	    echo got $var

	If you type a DEL after the prompt, the script won't terminate

	until you type CR.  It ought to terminate right away.

SUGGESTED FIX:
	LOCAL	readb()
	{
		REG FILE	f=standin;
		REG INT		len;

	/* Begin 32nix Change - set mark for return from longjmp */
		IF setjmp(INTbuf) == 0 THEN trapjmp[INTR] = 1; FI
		REP	IF trapnote&SIGSET THEN newline(); sigchk() FI
#ifdef OLD_BAD_CODE
		PER (len=read(f->fdes,f->fbuf,f->fsiz))<0 ANDF trapnote DONE
#else
		PER trapnode ANDF (len=read(f->fdes,f->fbuf,f->fsiz))<0 DONE
#endif
		trapjmp[INTR] = 0;
	/* End 32nix Change */
		return(len);
	}

I take back my fix - it doesn't work as I suggested.

However, I still consider the current behaviour a bug.
