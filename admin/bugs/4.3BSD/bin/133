Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) sh muffs pipes if stdout is closed
#Index: /bin/sh MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87)
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "/bin/sh" program muffs pipes if its standard output is closed.

Repeat-By:

	Here's a simple program that shows the problem:

		Script started on Sat Apr  9 15:05:35 1988
		$ cat try.c
		main()
		{
			close(1);
			execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c",
				"echo Hello | od 1>&2", (char *) 0);
			abort();
		}
		$ cc try.c
		$ a.out
		0000000
		$ exit

		script done on Sat Apr  9 15:05:59 1988

	And if you prefer a more realistic example, compile and run this code:

		#include "stdio.h"

		extern FILE *	popen();

		main()
		{
			(void) fclose(stdout);
			if (popen("pr | lpr", "w") != stdout)
				abort();
			(void) printf("Hello, world!\n");
			(void) pclose(stdout);
		}

	and note the lack of printer output.

	The problem is common to both /bin/sh and /bin/sh.4bsd.
