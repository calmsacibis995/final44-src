Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) tar can't 'x' latest copy of read-only files
#Index: /bin/tar MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: bin/tar 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a tar archive has multiple copies of a read-only file
	(as can happen if a tape is made using tar's 'r' option),
	the latest version of the file can't be extracted unless
	you're adroit at job control or are the super user.
