Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) awk dumps core on (bogus) negative field numbers
#Index: /bin/awk, /usr/5bin/awk MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: bin/awk 4.3BSD

Description:
	Both /bin/awk and /usr/5bin/awk dump core if a script erroneously
	tries to access a negatively-indexed field.

Repeat-By:
	A "real life" example that's supposed to print the next-to-last field
	of each input line:

		Script started on Tue Oct  6 10:34:31 1987
		$ /bin/awk '{print $(NF-1)}'
		hello
		hello

		awk: Memory fault - core dumped
		$ /usr/5bin/awk '{print $(NF-1)}'
		hello
		hello

		awk: illegal reference to array Memory fault - core dumped
		$ exit

		script done on Tue Oct  6 10:35:49 1987

	The minimum that shows up the problem:

		awk 'BEGIN {print $-1}'
