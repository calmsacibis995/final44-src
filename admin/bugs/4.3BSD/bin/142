Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 sh's "exec" and "<<" don't mix
#Index: bin/sh MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a "sh" command uses both "exec" and "<<",
	a dropping is left in "/tmp".

Repeat-By:
	Clear out the /tmp directory.
	Type in the command
		( echo "exec cat << EOF" ; echo "Hi" ; echo "EOF" ) > try
	then type
		sh try
	After the (correct) output
		Hi
	has been produced, note the leftover temporary file in the /tmp
	directory.
