Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 make can't do "entry dependencies" (with "fix")
#Index: bin/make MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: bin/make 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "make" commmand can't handle the "entry point dependencies"
	described when you
		man make

Repeat-By:
	Run these two commands:

		echo "x: /lib/libc.a((_malloc))" > makefile
		make

	...and note the output:

		Make: __.SYMDEF       8 is not an object module.  Stop.

	(Side note:  in MORE/bsd, the entry point dependency stuff is
	described when you
		man make
	but doesn't show up in "/usr/doc/ps1/12.make/make.ms"; in System V,
	the entry point dependency stuff is *not* described when you
		man make
	but *is* described in the Support Tools Guide.)
