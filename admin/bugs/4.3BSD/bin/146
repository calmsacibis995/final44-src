Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 ps command reports bogus long-running processes
Index: bin/ps.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MORE/bsd 4.3 ps command sometimes gives reports of processes that
	have run for 110 minutes, when no such processes are currently present
	on the system.

Repeat-By:
	Regularly using "ps axgu" to check on the computer's status,
	and being watchful.

Fix:
	The problem is that a process may be marked as "RUN"ning before its
	page table entries are filled in; this causes ps to repeatedly use
	the contents of the first 1024 bytes of physical memory to fill in
	the "user structure" for the process.

	The change that's needed in "ps.c" (your line numbers will vary):

*** OLD/ps.c	Wed Mar 25 19:17:29 1987
--- NEW/ps.c	Wed Mar 25 19:16:58 1987
