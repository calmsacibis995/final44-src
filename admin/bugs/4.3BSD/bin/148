Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) /usr/5bin/admin dumps core (no fix)
Index: bin/admin 4.3BSD

Description:
	The /usr/5bin/admin executable on the MORE/bsd 4.3 4/13/87 Maintenance
	Release dumps core.  (The "admin" executable appears in two of the
	files on the tape; both versions are identical.)

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Mon May 11 12:49:17 1987
	$ /usr/5bin/4.3BSD/admin -i s.s
	Bus error - core dumped
	$ exit

	script done on Mon May 11 12:49:51 1987

Workaround:
	Restore the version of /usr/5bin/admin that came with the original
	Mt. Xinu release tape.  Remember, though, that this may cause some
	problems since the admin command will do time conversion differently
	than everything else on the system.
