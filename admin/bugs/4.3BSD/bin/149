Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 sh(1) and sh.4bsd don't handle "login" command correctly
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	The sh(1) manual page says this about the "login" command:

	     login [arg ...]
		  Equivalent to 'exec login arg ...'.

	but I'm afraid the manual isn't quite up to snuff here.

Repeat-By:
	Add a
		sh::300:0::/tmp:/bin/sh
	line to the /etc/passwd file.  Go to a terminal xx and login as "sh".
	When you get the
		$
	type
		ps -atxx
	and note that there's one sh running.  Type
		login sh
	and
		ps -atxx
	and note two shells running.  Type
		login sh
	and
		ps -atxx
	and note three shells.  Typing control-D will drop you back to
	previous shells.

	Note that this bug is also present in /bin/sh.4bsd,
	but not in /bin/csh.

	If you have /bin/sh users on your system who type "login" rather than
	"logout" when relinquishing a terminal, this is a security problem.
