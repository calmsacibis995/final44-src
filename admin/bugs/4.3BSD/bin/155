Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 login command fails to initialize umask
Index: bin/login.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "login" command fails to initialize the "umask" value,
	making its value unpredictable if it isn't explicitly set
	(as is the case, for example, if the super-user logs in
	using the "toor" account and the "/.profile" file distributed
	with 4.3BSD.)

Repeat-By:
	Log in using an account that does not set "umask" in its
	".login" (or ".profile") file.  Then type in the commands

		umask 700 ; clear ; login

	and log in again.  Finally, type in the command

		umask 

	and discover that the umask value has survived through the login
	sequence.

Fix:
	One possibility is to note the above feature of the system,
	also noting the advisability of having an explicit "umask"
	command in ".login" and ".profile" commands.  Another possibility
	is to add a
		(void) umask(CMASK);
	statement to "/usr/src/bin/login.c"
