DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The documentation for the 't' command in sed says that the branch
is taken if any substitutions have been made since the last new line
was read or the last 't' command.  It lies.  Only a 't' command will
clear the appropriate flag.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
Change the documentation to match reality -- there are probably
thousands of sed scripts out there that would break if you changed
the behavior.

OTHER COMMENTS:

This bug is also in 4.2bsd.
