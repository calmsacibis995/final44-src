MODULE NAME: mail

BUG PORTED TO UTX? Yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
When reading one's mailbox, the h+ option doesn't work.

The z option is supposed to be the same as the h option with scrolling--this
isn't the case.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
h	/* correctly displays current message list */
h+	/* incorrectly displays current message list */
h-	/* correctly displays previous message list */

	/* the h command should work the same as z without scrolling. */
	/* Here is what z does */
z	/* correctly displays current message list */
z+	/* correctly displays next message list */
z-	/* correctly displays previous message list */

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
mail	(/usr/spool/mail/$USER should be large, > 18 messages)
h 1
/* (see list of messges) */
h +
/* (incorrectly see same list) */
z +
/* (correctly see next list) */
SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:  This might be a Berkeley bug.

I seem to remember this from the distant past.  This may be
a man page bug.  If you look in the source code, there is no
attempt to do anything with 'h+' or 'h-'.
