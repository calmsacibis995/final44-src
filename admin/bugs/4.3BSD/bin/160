DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
flcopy -h copies the same file recursively on the floppy.
You will find this is true, if you do "flcopy -r" 
after you did "flcopy -h".

Another issue is that the default floppy drive is /dev/floppy.
This should be changed to /dev/rfl0. Originally, the default
floppy drive for arff is also /dev/floppy, but it has been

changed to /dev/rfl0, so flcopy should get the same changes.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
