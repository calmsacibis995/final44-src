DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
On page 5, the first paragraph, it has
	"..for event 9, or by .... as in !?mic?'....."
instead of !?mic?', it should just be !?mic?

The same page, under the basic word designators,
instead of x|-y, it should be x-y
instead of "0-y|", it should be "0-y"
instead of "x|-$", it should be "x-$"
instead of "x|*", it should be "x*"

On page 6, second paragraph, it has
	"...and last arguments from the command matching ?foo?'."
instead of ?foo?', it should just be ?foo?

On page 8, some square brackets should not have been italicized.

	1. $name[selector]
	2. ${name[selector]}
	3. under ${# name}, at the end of the sentence, it has [selector].

On page 9, in the middle of the page, it has

	"The character ~ at .....Standing alone, i.e., ...~ it expands
	 to the invokers home directory...."

instead of invokers, it should be invoker's.

On the same page, it has 
	"Similarly ../{memo,*box} might expand to ../memo../box../mbox."
There should be spaces between ../memo, ../box, and ../mbox.

On page 13, "exec command", it has
	"Executes the specified command in place of the current"
instead, it should be
	"Executes the specifiied command in place of the current Shell."
and only italize the word command.

On page 14, several parenthesis should not have been italicized.

	1. if (expr) command
	2. if (expr) then
	3. else if (expr2) then
	4. under "endif",  the end of the last sentence,
		"... or after an else.)"

On page 16, the first line, under option "nice"
	"Command is always executed ..., and the restricitions place ..."
instead of "place", it should be "placed".

The same page, under "onintr label",
	1. "The second form "onintr -"..."
	   it should be 
	   "The second form, onintr -, ..." with onintr being BOLD.
	2. "...to execute a "goto label"
	   it should be
	   "...to execute a goto label" with goto BOLDed and label italicized
	3. "..., all forms of onintr have no meaning..."
	   onintr should be BOLDed instead of italicized.

The same page, under "pushd +n",
	"Given a name argument, pushd changes to ..."
	pushd should be bolded instead of italicized.

On page 17, 
	1. under "set name[index]=word", the square brackets
	   should not be italicized.
	2. under "set name=(wordlist)", the parenthesis should
	   not be italicized.
	3. under "shift variable", argv[1], the square brackets
	   should not be italicized.
	4. under "switch (string)", the parenthesis should not
	   be italicized.

On page 18,
	1. under "unlimitresource", it should be "unlimit resource"

On page 19,
	1. under "while (expr)", the parenthesis should not be

	   italicized.
	2. under "@ name [index] = expr", the square brackets
	   should not be italicized.

	   "...The third form assigns ... index-th argument ...
	   Both name and its index-th ..."
	   The "-th" in "index-th" should not be italicized.

On page 21, under "path", the last sentence
	"...to give the rehash or the commands may not be found."
instead it should say
	"...to give the rehash command or the commands ..."

 where th manpage talks about existence tests and the like, it
 leaves out the - signs:

 it should be:

 if ( -e foo ) then
 .....

 but it says:

 if ( e foo ) then 
 .....

 this will drive you bats for a day or so....
