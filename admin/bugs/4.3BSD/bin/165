DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
stty(1) man page says,
"tilde   converts tilde (~) to backslash (\) on output (for Hazeltine terminals)"
Since this is not the case for other types of terminals, we should
add a line and say it may be different for other types of terminals.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

This is misleading. stty tilde should always convert tilde to backquote on
ALL terminals. This is only useful for Hazeltine terminals, but should
behave consistently for all terminals (otherwise, how can you test it
without a Hazeltine?). Neither stty nor the tty driver should look at the
environment or whatever to determine what your terminal type is - it should
take what you tell i.

I believe that tilde is converted to backquote instead of backslash on
output (1) because backslash is used for so many other things, and (2)
because once, a long time ago, the numeric code that is now backquote used
to be backslash, in the United States. Backquote (accent grave) was only
added in the international standardization efforts.

it converts (under really ideal circumstances, if the
moon is right and if you have made the proper sacrifices)
occurrences of 'tilde' to '\^'.

but it doesnt work very well.  its easier to just NOT
SET the -tilde EVER EVER EVER and to pretend that the
tilde you just typed is really there.  it causes less
brain-damage to the user......this option should
be excised.

I used `stty -tilde' quite happily for 3 years on Hazeltine 1500s and 1420s,
and never had any problem. It isn't at all safe to `pretend it was there',
if you have just happened to type in an escape code like `lock keyboard'.

Tilde conversion works most places. It should work here.
