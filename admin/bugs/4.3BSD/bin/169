fixed on al and fang.  vax coming asap, mycroft & burt a little
later.

---------------------------------------
.....
case 'u':
#ifdef OLDCODE
	uflg++; break;
#else
	tflg++; uflg++; break;
#endif
case 'c':
#ifdef OLDCODE
	cflg++; break;
#else
	tflg++; cflg++; break;
#endif
.....
---------------------------------------

see, the sort routine (fcmp) checks to see if it should sort on
the time field ls builds into the "afile" struct.  but it only
checks to see if the tflg is on, so you could increment the
uflg and cflg all day and never make it work.  ls stuffs whatever
time you ask for (creation, access or modification) into the
'ftime' field of "afile", but that just gets ignored if the
sort doesnt get told to sort on it.  so all that needs to be
done is increment tflg when doing any kind of sort on the
time field, and the 'r' option also works correctly with these.
simple.  i will fix ls on the other machines as soon as i get some
time....

..and on the vax.

note that you could always have made it work by specifying
say, '-tu' or '-tc', but this is not what the original man
page says.  the 32S man page does indicate that you need to
specify '-tu' or '-tul', but says nothing about the -c option.
i think it's better if you can say 'ls -c' and get what you
think you should get....

the 4.3 man page does no better.  4.3 adds a -S option to
sort by size, but addresses none of the other known bugs.
(although i havent looked at the password stuff.)
