DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:

The command "file dir/" will always return, "dir:	directory"
even if dir is a link to another directory.  The command "file dir"
will correctly analyze dir.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

The problem is probably with a lower level routine--I didn't look
for it.
