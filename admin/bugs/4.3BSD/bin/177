DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:

"ls -F" does not consistently display a link to a directory.
It appears that if dir1 is a link to dir2, both dirs being in
the same directory, then dir1 is listed as dir1/.  However, if
dir1 is linked to a more complicated pathname such as /mnt/foo/dir3,
then dir1 is listed as dir@.  This is a real problem if ls is
used in a pipe.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
