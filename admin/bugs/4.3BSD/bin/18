Subject: chsh doesn't find new shell
Index: 	bin/passwd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	chsh doesn't work.  It never finds the shell you want.
Repeat-By:
	Use passwd -s (or chsh) to try to change your shell.
Fix:
	passwd runs through getusershell twice: once to verify your
	current shell, and once to verify your new shell.  However,
	there isn't (and should be) a setusershell() call in the middle
	to rewind the list of shells.
