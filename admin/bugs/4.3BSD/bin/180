DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The 1.3 tbl is broken.  It does not properly draw horizontal lines (i.e.
the lines are too long.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
make practically any boxed table, eg.
--------------
.TS
center, box, tab(;);
c|c.
header1;header2
_
stuff1;stuff2
=
stuff1;stuff2
_
stuff1;stuff2
=
stuff1;stuff2
.TE
--------------

and look at the resulting table.

SUGGESTED FIX:
remove the double box "fixes" ported from 1.2 which are in  files
t6.c  and  tu.c.   Note that all of the changes have already been
encorporated into 2.0.

OTHER COMMENTS:
Now comes the important stuff....

The tbl under 1.2 is apparently from SysV.  The tbl from  1.3  is
from  berkeley.   Therefore, when the changes made to the 1.2 tbl
were  merged  into  the  1.3  tbl,  well,  you  can  imagine  the
problems...

The question is, what happenned to  the  SysV  tbl?   It  is  not
distributed with 1.3.

Furthermore, the 'fixes' to 1.2 were  supposed  to  fix  the  tbl
double  box  option.   Well, double boxes never worked even under
1.2  (in  other  words,  the  fixes  really  didn't  do  much  of
anything),  and  the fixes under 1.3 really broke things.  I have
incorporated into the 2.0 tbl the REAL fixes to fix double boxes.
So,  the  double  box  option will now work with the 2.0 tbl, but
ONLY for troff.  Double boxes with nroff we can all forget  about
because of the way tbl is designed.  If someone wants to make tbl
work better with nroff, then go ahead and redesign tbl because  I
think that is what would be necessary.
