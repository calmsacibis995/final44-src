SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	m4 documetation and arg parsing bad

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.3
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	m4 (both SV and BSD versions)

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)
	Software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)
	4

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	There are a number of interlocking problems.

	 1) There is only one version of the m4 manual page, but
	    the SV and BSD versions of the command are invoked differently.
	    The man page is for the SV version.  The SV version has a
	    number of parameters (e.g. -B<number>) the the BSD version
	    doesn't.
	
	 2) The BSD version has a (I think undocumented) feature that
	    you can specify "-" as a file name on the command line,
	    and m4 will read from stdin.  Unfortunately, it also takes
	    -B<number>, or ANYTHING else starting with "-", to mean
	    that it should read from stdin.  This is a very drastic
	    difference from the documented behaviour (see 1 above).

	 3) Users who used m4 on UTX/32 1.2 got the AT&T version.
	    They get the BSD version, by default, in 1.3.  (They get
	    the old man page, though.)  This leads to much confusion.

	 4) The SV version of m4, when presented with a nonexistant
	    file, prints a garbage error message.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
	Run the following script (in BSD mode):
		#!/bin/sh

		echo m4 x
		echo Only \"m4: file not found: x\" should appear
		m4 x <<!!EOF
		This should not appear
		!!EOF

		echo m4 -B10 x
		echo Only \"m4: file not found: x\" should appear
		m4 -B10 x <<!!EOF
		This should not appear
		!!EOF

		echo sv m4 x
		echo Only \"m4: file not found: x\" should appear
		sv m4 x <<!!EOF
		This should not appear
		!!EOF

		echo sv m4 -B10 x
		echo Only \"m4: file not found: x\" should appear
		sv m4 -B10 x <<!!EOF
		This should not appear
		!!EOF

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
	m4 x
	Only "m4: file not found: x" should appear
	m4: file not found: x
	m4 -B10 x
	Only "m4: file not found: x" should appear
	m4: file not found: x
	This should not appear
	sv m4 x
	Only "m4: file not found: x" should appear

	m4:-:1 can't open file
	sv m4 -B10 x
	Only "m4: file not found: x" should appear

	m4:-:1 can't open file

SUGGESTED FIX:
	 1) provide both versions of documentation.

	 2) Fix BSD version of m4 so that it complains about a
	    parameter that starts with "-" but isn't exactly "-".

	 3) Fix the error message in the SV version.
