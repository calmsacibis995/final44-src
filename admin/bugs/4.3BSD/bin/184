diff exit status not always right

MODULE NAME: diff

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER) Software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The exit status code for diff has been altered from the 4.3 version to
fix some random QAR. However, some things which should exit with status
2 are now exiting with 0. Specifically, giving diff the wrong number of
arguments causes it to return 0. This is probably mixed up in the
changes to allow diff to take a file from standard input.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT & HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM: (preferably a shell script)
% diff /etc/motd
diff: two filename arguments required
% echo $status
0

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
Diff on the 780 (4.2), 750 (4.3), and in the system V world all return 2
for this example.
