sendmail or /bin/mail doesn't correctly update a user's
/usr/spool/mail/$HOME file so that login incorrectly identifies 'old mail'.

For example:

>From /utx2.1/base/src/src/bin/login/login.c:
		if (stat(maildir, &st) == 0 && st.st_size != 0)
			printf("You have %smail.\n",
				(st.st_mtime > st.st_atime) ? "new " : "");

The modification time has to be > the access time for the
'new mail' message to appear from login.  I assume that the access time
shouldn't change when mail is sent (written) to a user's spool file.
It looks to me like /bin/mail (or sendmail) is doing a 'creat' OR a 'write'
and 'read' where it should only be doing a 'write'.

Also, I couldn't track down where the 'You have old mail' message was coming
from--perhaps I was in the wrong tree--but this message is coming from login,
correct?

right you are;  login is the culprit--when you login.  there's
a couple of teensy local changes to make it print prettier, but
nothing dramatic.
