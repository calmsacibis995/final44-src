test -w fails on directories

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780

MODULE NAME: test.c

BUG PORTED TO UTX? yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
test -w will always fail on a directory, even if you have permission to
write in that directory. this is because in the routine tio() it just does
an open for write on whatever name you give test. directories can't be
opened for writing, so in the strictest sense test is correct, but this
means there is no way to test for a writable directory. (thus, this could be
considered either a bug or a feature.)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
% test -w /tmp
% echo $status
1

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
if this is deemed a bug, in tio(), if the open fails check to see if errno
is EISDIR.
