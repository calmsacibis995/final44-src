Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD
#Index: 4.3 BSD and Sun 3.2 (and greater, probably), csh
     I have repeated this on 4.3 BSD Vaxen and Sun Unix 3.2 Sun 3/50s.

Repeat-by:
	$ csh -f
	% set history=5000
	% echo foo
	foo
	% ^foo^bar
	echo bar
	bar
	% history
	     1  set history=5000
	     2  echo foo
	 -1000  echo bar     3  echo bar
	     4  history
	%

    Any large value for `history' will do it.  I have been unable to find
the exact threshold, but anything larger than 2000 will always work, I think.
I guess most people don't set history to a big number, so they haven't
noticed it.  This will also happen using `!!:s/foo/bar' or '!2:s/foo/bar',
as well as with the trailing ^ or / appended.

Aside: Can anyone with source access tell me what type is used for the
value of `history', so I can make it 32767 or (2^31) - 1, or whatever?

Not quite.  Anything more than 1000+next_event+2 suffices.  (I.e.,
if this is the very first command, 1004 is enough.)

The history number `-1000' should give a large hint.  If you look
in /usr/src/bin/csh/sh.lex.c you will find where csh enters substitution
events as number -1000.  The idea is that since

-most people don't set history to a big number,

the negative event will be discarded from the history list since
it occurred over 1000 commands ago.

-Aside: Can anyone with source access tell me what type is used for the
-value of `history', so I can make it 32767 or (2^31) - 1, or whatever?

`int', of course.  The variable itself is a string, but it is converted
to an integer whenever needed (once per command!).

Summary: fix
I have fixed this bug.

Csh uses the value "-1000" to mark internal, temporary history events
created during substitutions. When history is very large as in "set
history=2000", the set of events to keep is much larger and subsequent
history processing will include the temporary events.

These temporary events are usually thrown away after each command because
csh asks: if (history counter - event number) > history value, then toss
this event. If history value  ~ 2000, and event number = -1000 ( ==>
temporary), you can see why the shell would choose to keep the temp event.

To apply the fix, change the last return statement in function dosub() in
file sh.lex.c to return -32767 instead of -1000. This will allow history
to be set to ~32767 (Big!) without errors.
