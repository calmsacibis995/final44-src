Subject: Two csh bugs and fixes.
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Here are another two somewhat related csh bugs and their fixes.
The fixes are in the same file, so I send the diff of the file only once.
Don't put your csh sources away, in some days I will send some other
fixes which you might want to apply.

1.)
	Symptoms:
		- create files a-b and acd
		- echo a[-c]d
		--> acd
			the "-" is interpretated as a meta character for "range"
		- echo a[\-c]d
		--> will still yield only acd, "-" is not a meta character, because
			it has its 8'th bit set, but it does not match either because
			of this.
			I rather expected it to match a-d and acd.
		- echo a[c-]d
		--> missing "]" : the "]" is interpreted as second argument
			to range-operator "-", and eaten

	Diagnosis:
		You can play around a little bit with this, all effects are
		created by the fact, that there is no test, if a left or
		right hand side of "-" is empty, and the 8'th bit is not stripped
		of the characters so you cannot distinguish between - and "-".
		There was a discussion recently, what the
		shell should do with files whose names contained unprintable
		characters. As the csh uses the 8'th bit internally for quoting
		it cannot but ignore cases where such a bit REALLY is desired.
		Write a program to manipulate such weird file names, the csh is
		unreliable in this respect.
2.)
	Symptoms:
		- create files a,b and acb
		- echo a{,,c}b
		-->ab ab acd
		- echo a{\,,c}b
		-->ab ab acd
			I rather expected a,b acb
	Diagnosis:
		The reason is similar to the above.

Therapy:
	apply the following context diff to sh.glob.c.
	The resulting routines will let you quote meta characters in
	"[...]" or "{...}" expressions. So a{\,,c}b will expand to
	"a,b acb" and a[\-c]d will match files a-d and acd.

  				} else

  						ok++;
  			}
  			if (cc == 0)

  				} else

  			if (cc == 0)

I hope, I found all the problem places. If not so, inform me.

Absorb, apply and enjoy,
