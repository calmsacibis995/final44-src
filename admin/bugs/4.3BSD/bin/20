Subject: Dead dialup lines with detached jobs
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Description:
	We have a vanilla 4.3 system up on 750 with a dhu and a dmf.
If a phone line is hung up with a detached job running the line is
permanently disabled.  Only editing the ttys file and doing a kill
will restore the line.  The lines are on the dhu and they appear to
be both waiting for open and open (pstat).  Help....
Repeat-By:
	Do a "sleep 300 &", hang up, try to dialup again (no answer).
