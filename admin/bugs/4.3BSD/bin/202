Subject: bug in refer using $LIST$ command
Index: bin/refer,old/refer 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Using the "-e" option of refer along with multiple "$LIST$"
	commands (as described in "Refer -- A Bibliography System" by
	Bill Tuthill on p. 5) does not work.  /usr/bin/refer produces the
	following error message:
		Assertion failed: file "hunt2.c", line 77
	and /usr/old/refer produces the following error message:
		Bus error
Repeat-By:
	Create a file that looks like:
		references
		.[
		$LIST$
		.]
		.bp
		more references
		.[
		$LIST$
		.]
	Run refer on the file with the "-e" command line option.
