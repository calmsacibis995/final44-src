Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) tar fails to check for superfluous data
Index: 	bin/tar 4.3BSD

Description:
	The tar command fails to check for superfluous data after the "end of
	tar archive" marker in its input.

Repeat-By:
	This script shows the problem at its simplest:

		Script started on Thu Jun 16 13:42:11 1988
		$ tar cf try /etc/passwd
		$ cat /usr/pub/ascii >> try
		$ tar tf try
		/etc/passwd
		$ exit

		script done on Thu Jun 16 13:42:59 1988

	A side effect of the failure to check is that non-rewinding special
	files are left positioned *before* the EOF marker rather than after
	it.  This causes surprising results if, for example, you try to make
	a table of the X Window System core distribution tape:

		Script started on Thu Jun 16 13:18:28 1988
		$ mt rew
		$ tar tf /dev/nrmt8 | tail
		./extensions/server/Makefile
		./extensions/server/Imakefile
		./extensions/server/bezier.c
		./extensions/server/zoid.c
		./extensions/test/
		./extensions/test/Makefile
		./extensions/test/Imakefile
		./extensions/test/beziertest.c
		./extensions/test/zoidtest.c
		./extensions/test/datafile
		$ tar tf /dev/nrmt8 | tail
		tar: tape read error: unexpected EOF
		$ exit

		script done on Thu Jun 16 13:22:39 1988
	
Fix:
	It's way too late in the game to change the behavior of tar,
	since there are surely scripts out there that do "mt fsf"s in
	order to get things right.  The failure to check (and its side effect)
	is probably worth mentioning in the manual page.  Perhaps a way of
	getting the check (either a flag or a newly-named link to tar that
	gets checked for) should be provided.
