Subject: sh wedges terminal if TSTP is trapped
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	/bin/sh wedges the terminal if TSTP is trapped.

Repeat-By:
	Logging on, typing these commands. . .
		$ /bin/sh
		$ trap 'echo hi' 1 2 3 18
		$ sleep 5
		^C
		hi
		$ sleep 5
		^Z
	. . .and going to another terminal.

	Both the BRL version of sh and the Berkeley version of sh
	(as provided by Mt. Xinu) suffer from this problem.  (The vintage
	version of ksh we run here at elsie doesn't wedge the terminal,
	but it doesn't "echo hi" either.)

Here is what happens with the current BRL Bourne shell (job control
not enabled, of course):

$ sleep 5
^Zptrace: Stop from keyboard
hi
$ 

leaving the "sleep 5" process blocked ("T" state according to our ^T
mini-systat feature).  Note that the shell trap WAS executed.

With job control enabled, what one would expect to happen happens.
Whatever bug there was must have gotten fixed somewhere along the way.
