Subject: C shell exits silently when started in non-readable directory
Index: 	bin/csh 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If you start a C shell up in a directory that is not readable, so that
	"getwd" fails, it will exit silently.  It attempts to write a message
	to file descriptor 2, but by that time file descriptor 2 is no longer
	the standard error.
Repeat-By:
	cd /tmp
	mkdir foo
	cd foo
	chmod 0 foo
	/bin/csh
	ps		# note that the csh you started isn't there
Fix:
	The following change to "sh.dir.c" was made here at Sun; it appears to
	fix the problem:

*** /usr/src/bin/csh/sh.dir.c	Tue Jun 11 18:59:53 1985
--- ./sh.dir.c	Mon Sep 12 11:53:53 1988

*** 37,43 ****
  	else {
  		cp = getwd(path);
  		if (cp == NULL) {
! 			(void) write(2, path, strlen(path));
  			exit(1);
  		}
  	}
--- 37,44 ----
  	else {
  		cp = getwd(path);
  		if (cp == NULL) {
! 			haderr = 1;
! 			printf ("%s\n", path);
  			exit(1);
  		}
  	}
