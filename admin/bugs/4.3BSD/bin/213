For your consideration:

I received the following suggestion from one of my Customers:

> Subject: SUGGESTion--"At" subject line

I changed the "MAILER" constant from "/bin/mail" to "/usr/ucb/mail", and
then changed the "sprintf" line to:

	sprintf(mailtouser,"%s -s \"Message from the at system\" %s",
		MAILER, user);

Pretty minor changes, but a "Subject:" line is nice.
