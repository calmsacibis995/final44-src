Subject: 34-row screwup on 4.3BSD and SunOS

Index: bin/login 4.3BSD

Does anyone know what is causing this bizarre bug and what to do about
it?  Occasionally, once in 300 or more logins, UNIX will decide that it
has a 34-row, 80-column display, overriding termcap.  The baud rate may
also be bizarre.  It has been seen more than once on Telnet from a CS-1
to a Sun (SunOS v3.5, 4.2BSD-oid); on rlogin from a VAX (4.3BSD) to a
VAX or to a Sun; and maybe on rlogin from Sun to VAX.  The data are too
sparse to exclude other combinations.  We are fairly sure that it never
happens on hardwired terminals.  The Sun console is also not involved
here.  If you log out and log in again, getting the same pseudo-tty,
the problem will still be there; but if you get a different ptty it will
not be affected.  Rlogins from Suntools/Shelltool to the affected systems
happen on occasion, plausibly explaining the 34x80, but not why the default
0x0 usually prevails.  

This scenario shows a workaround, plus a bug in stty (on Sun):
    stty everything
	... 34 rows 80 columns
    stty rows 0
    stty everything
	... 80 rows 0 columns
    stty rows 0
    stty everything
	... 0 rows 0 columns
and it's fine.  (You may want to set the baud rate if vi thinks it's slow.)
"stty rows 0 columns 0" will reset it in one step.

login normally clobbers the rows/columns setting, but not in SunOS 3.*.
If you get a pty with an attached background process, the old rows value
is left around.  Suntools apparently leaves such traps.

We fixed it here by adding the tty size clobbering code to login on the
Suns.
