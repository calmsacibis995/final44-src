Subject: filename symbols being global is annoying
Index: bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	I've got a program that I link into a big .o file with all its
	libraries, so all that's left to be linked in is -lc (this has
	to do with university of wisconsin changing their OS every other
	week...besides it's easier to transmit a 140K object than 1.4Mb
	of source). Unfortunately, the target system is Ultrix, which doesn't
	know to ignore multiple definitions of external N_FN symbols, as
	the latest BSD linker does. This means that if you have two files
	of the same name (in this case "move.o" in my program and the same
	in the curses library), the foreign linker will choke. 
Repeat-By:
	See above
Fix:
	Don't make the filename symbols be external. It doesn't seem to me
	there's a pressing need for them to be external, though of course I
	don't know as much about recent changes as you folks :)
