Subject: diff doesn't clean up its temporary file
Index: bin/diff/diffreg.c 4.3BSD +FIX

[This fix from Vern Paxson, vern@pistachio.ee.lbl.gov]

Description:
	Diff fails to remove the temporary file it creates when reading
	from stdin. This bug was introduced in version 4.18 of diffreg.c.

Repeat-By:
	Execute:

	    % echo Lose | diff -r /dev/null

	and then notice the /tmp/da???? file which is left behind.
	(Note that okeeffe isn't running the broken diff.)

Fix:
	Setup the global pointer.
