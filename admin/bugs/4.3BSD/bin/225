Subject: nested  'if' or 'switch' give wrong result
Index: 	bin/csh/sh.parse.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	'if' and 'switch' seem to simple-mindedly search for
	the first instance of 'else' , 'endsw' , rather than keeping
	track of nesting level.

Repeat-By:
	Try the following shell script.  Faulty output is:
 if : 0 && 0 is true
switch : 0 == 0
switch : 0 == 1

#! /bin/csh
#	Test nesting of 'if' 
if( 0 ) then
  if( 1 ) then
	echo " if : 0 && 1 is true"
  else
	echo " if : 0 && 0 is true"
  endif
endif
#	Test nesting of 'switch'
switch ( 0 )
case 0:
	echo  "switch : 0 == 0"
	switch ( 1 )
	endsw
case 1:
	echo "switch : 0 == 1"
endsw
exit
