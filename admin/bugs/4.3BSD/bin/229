Subject: control Z functioning improperly
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU


Description:
	have established aliases with multiple cmds like:
	alias vi "mesg n;vi \!*;mesg y"
	alias ml "pushd ~;mesg n;mail;mesg y;popd"

If I '^Z' out of (for eg.) vi or mail then return, the system doesn't 
complete the remainder of the alias when I leave the command in the 
normal fashion. Using the above example aliases,
messages are not turned back on/directory not popped.

The alias does complete properly if i don't suspend the process with ^Z.

Repeat-By:
	create alias with cmds following (for eg.) mail,vi
	invoke alias
	ctl Z out of (for eg.) mail,vi. then bring back into foreground.
	quit the command in normal fashion.
	check to see if commands following (for eg.) mail,vi in alias
	   were executed.
