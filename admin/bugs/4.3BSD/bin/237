Subject: Setting History Number as part of the prompt fails with new csh
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Description:

Several users here use an alias which resets the prompt to show the current
working directory and current history number.  An example appears below.
It works fine in setting up the original prompt at login, but then fails
afterwards with the error message:
	\): event not found.

Repeat By:
place the following alias in your .login file

alias cd 'cd \!*; set prompt=vax-$cwd:t\(\!\):'

Note:
our .login files actually do a "source .userlogin" which contains the
above command.

Any ideas?
