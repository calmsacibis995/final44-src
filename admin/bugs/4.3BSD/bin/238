Subject: problem with cdpath interpretation in Cshell
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Description:
In csh, I have assigned all of my directories to my cdpath. 
I accomplish this task by the following line in my .login file
set cdpath= ( `ls -R | grep : | sed 's,:,,g' | sed 's,^,~/,g'` )
Note that all of my directories have unique names. In
fact, when I type
echo $cdpath
I get a correct listing of my directories. So now I need
only type
cd DIRECTORY
to move my working directory to DIRECTORY without having
to worry about the structure of my directory tree. The
strange thing is that this technique works for all
directories EXCEPT those immediately branched off the
main directory (despite these being correctly included in
$cdpath as verified earlier).

Repeat-By:
type the following line while in your home directory in csh->
set cdpath= ( `ls -R | grep : | sed 's,:,,g' | sed 's,^,~/,g'` )
move into any of your subdirectories (not your home
directory) and type
cd DIRECTORY
where DIRECTORY is any subdirectory of your home directory,
i.e. you have previously created ~/DIRECTORY 
When I do this, I receive an error message saying
the file/directory DIRECTORY doesn't exist. What's going
on?
