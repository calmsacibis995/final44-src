Subject: Sed does not clear the flag used by `t' when reading new input
Index: 	bin/sed 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	According to the sed manual page the test command `t'
	branches to the : command bearing the label specified
	if any substitutions have been made since the most recent
	reading of an input line or execution of a `t'.
	In the 4.3BSD version of sed the reading of an input line
	does not cancel the effect of substitutions made before
	reading the new line.  Thus if any of those substitutions
	succeded the first `t' to be executed will succeeed even if
	a new input line has been read.

Repeat-By:
	Execute the following:

sed -e '
s/hello/goodbye/
/goodbye/d
t n
a\
t failed
b
: n
a\
t succeeded' <<EOF
hello
world
EOF

	After reading the line containing `hello' the substitution will 
	succeed.  The d command starts a new cycle and thus the next t 
	should fail unless a substitution succeeds again.  After reading 
	`world' the substitution fails, but because of the bug, t succeeds 
	and the message `t succeeded' is printed.

Fix:
	Modify "bin/sed/sed1.c" as follows:

*** sed1.c.orig	Thu May 18 14:24:39 1989
--- sed1.c	Thu May 18 14:19:48 1989
***************
*** 650,655 ****
--- 650,656 ----
  {
  	register char	*p1, *p2;
  	register	c;
+ 	sflag = 0;
  	p1 = addr;
  	p2 = cbp;
  	for (;;) {
