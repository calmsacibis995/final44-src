Subject: C compiler or pre-processor include file problem.
Index: bin/cc.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Fails to properly flag a missing bracket or matching paren on an
	#include statment e.g. #include <sys/ioctl.h .  The missing
	bracket causes various problems with the compiler reporting
	the correct line for syntax errors and dbx correctly executing or
	even setting break points in the executable.

Repeat-By:
	The following source illustrates the problem:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h

main()
{
	printf("line one\n");
	printf("line two\n");
	printf("line three\n");
	printf("line four\n");
	printf("line five\n");
}

	If you cause a syntax problem the pre-processor will not report the
	correct line of the problem if it occures below the ioctl.h include
	statement.  When you get past the compile stage (which in my opinion
	you shouldn't) the binary and the source will not be in sync in dbx.
