Subject: csh ${xyz} syntax fails if variable name includes digits
Index: bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The csh variable "${vname}" fails when "vname" contains digits --
	for example, "${X11}".  A "Variable syntax" error is incorrectly
	diagnosed.  The problem does not occur if the enclosing braces are
	omitted.
Repeat-By:
	Try "csh -vc 'echo ${x1y}'".
Fix:
	It appears that in sh.lex.c, routine getdol(), the code:

		} else if letter(c))
			while (letter(c = getC(DOEXCL))) {
				if (np < &name[sizeof name / 2])
					*np++ = c;
			}

	should change the second "letter(...)" to read "alnum(...)".
	I haven't tried this out.
