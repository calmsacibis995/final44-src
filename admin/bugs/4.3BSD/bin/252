Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

	There are two /bin/sh bugs that I hope get fixed in 4.4.  These
bugs have existed since Version 7 and have been fixed in AT&T based /bin/sh's.
The first bug is that sh grabs file decriptor 11 (and 10, if it is reading
from a shell script) for its own purposes.  This causes a problem if a 
parent tries to pass an open file using descriptor 11 because sh will
close the file and re-open the descriptor for its own use.  Then, when
the child goes to use 11, it's not what it had expected.
	Second, sh cannot seem to execute shell scripts if all of the file
descriptors below 10 have already been used.

Thanks,
-Roger
