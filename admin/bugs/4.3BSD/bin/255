Subject: csh should print working directory for job done message
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The csh prints out the current working directory for the jobs
	command for jobs running in the background.  It doesn't, however,
	print out the working directory when the job done message is
	presented.  This would be useful.
