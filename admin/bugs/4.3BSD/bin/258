Rcp does not check that the source and destination host nor
filename are the same.  I know there are advantages to rlogin
to same host, but rcp?  And the name the same too causes the
file to be filled with nulls.
The error crept in when a shell with an rcp got moved to the
host to which it used to send stuff.  In other words "it happens".
