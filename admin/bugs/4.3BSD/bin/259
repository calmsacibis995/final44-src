Subject: rcp won't use shell if kshell locally unavailable
Index: 	bin/rcp.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@berkeley.edu
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU

Description:
	If KERBEROS is defined but the kshell service is not known to
	getservbyname, rcp.c will not try the regular shell service.
Repeat-By:
	Compile rcp.c with KERBEROS defined on a system that does not
	have Kerberos installed.  Run rcp.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch:

*** rcp.c.old	Tue May 15 10:42:03 1990
--- rcp.c	Tue May 15 10:42:18 1990
***************
*** 83,89 ****
  	if (sp == NULL) {
  		use_kerberos = 0;
  		old_warning("kshell service unknown");
! 		sp = getservbyname("kshell", "tcp");
  	}
  #else
  	sp = getservbyname("shell", "tcp");

  	sp = getservbyname("shell", "tcp");
