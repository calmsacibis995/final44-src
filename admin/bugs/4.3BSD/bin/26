Subject: /bin/chsh is broken
Index: 	bin/passwd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	chsh: /bin/sh is unacceptable as a shell.
	However, /bin/sh is in /etc/shells.

Repeat-By:
	Try to run 'chsh <yourself> /bin/sh' on calder from
	a non-root shell.

Fix:
	The getusershell(3) library needs to be reset after the
	checks for restricted shells are made.

	If the getusershell library hasn't been fixed yet (see my
	previous bug posting), you have to call endusershell() after
	the first loop using getusershell() but before the next
	loop using getusershell().  If the getusershell library
	has been fixed, then setusershell() is probably more intuitive.
