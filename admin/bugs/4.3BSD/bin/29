Subject: Problem with sort routine.
Index: bin 4.3BSD

Sort (1) on both the vaxes and suns does not work correctly.  The -pos
option does not seem to work.  For example, say I wish to sort the following
file, named x, only on the 3rd field:

By the way, please add a note to the manual page that fields are numbered
starting at zero.

	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
	1	2	3	1	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	3	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	4	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	1	6	7	8	9
	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	0
	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	0	1
	4	5	6	7	8	9	0	1	2
	5	6	7	8	9	0	1	2	3
	6	7	8	9	0	1	2	3	4
	7	8	9	0	1	2	3	4	5
	8	9	0	1	2	3	4	5	6
	9	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8

then sort -b -n +2 -3 should only sort on the 3rd field.

The fives lines starting with 1 2 .. should be ordered as (basically leaving
the fourth field un ordered):

	1	2	3	1	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	3	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	4	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	1	6	7	8	9
	
But what is produced is (fragment of output):

	1	2	3	1	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	1	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	2	4	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	3	5	6	7	8	9
	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9

(The fourth column is sorted TOO!)

Since I need to sort by several fields, I was planning to run sort a few
times, but this bug causes problems.
