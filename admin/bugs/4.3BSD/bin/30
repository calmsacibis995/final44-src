Index: bin/rcp 4.3BSD

on calder there is mismatch between rcp binary or source code
and the manual page.  if there really is version 6.4 source
code, where shall i find it?  i realize that since my retrieving
these files on 8 September the 4.3 sources have been moved
to monet.	--Genji Schmeder (CF&C unix staff)
