Subject: csh script dies on SIGTTIN
Index: bin/csh/??? 4.3BSD

Description:
	csh doesn't always handle SIGTTIN properly.
Repeat-By:
	Run the following script.  Type a ^Z to stop it, then 'bg' to
	place it in the background.  It immediately stops because
	of a SIGTTIN (as it should).  Now try to foreground it.  The
	csh running the script dies with the message "Stopped (tty input)".

	#! /bin/csh -f
	cat
