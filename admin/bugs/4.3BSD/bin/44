Subject: Syntax errors in /bin/sh source
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	Line 209 of xec.c is missing a semi-colon.
	Lines 16 and 65 of ctype.c use old fashioned initialization.
	Lines 74, 93 and 132 of msg.c use old fashioned initialization.
Repeat-By:
	Compile sh with a compiler that complains about such omissions.
Fix:
	Add a semi-colon to line 209 of xec.c.
	Add equal signs to lines 16 and 65 of ctype.c and lines 74, 93
	and 132 of msg.c.
