Subject: multiple TERM environmental variables when logging in via 4.3 telnet
Index: bin/login.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If you login via 4.3 telnet to a 4.3 telnetd, you end up with 2
	TERM environmental variables. Some UNIX utilities find the second one,
	which will be incorrect.
Repeat-By:
	Log in to a 4.3 system via a 4.3 telnet and enter 'printenv' command.
	I believe (not verified) that 'man' finds the 2nd incorrect value.
Fix:
	Correct /bin/login to check whether it has inherited a TERM
	environmental variable before it sets one itself. The 4.3 telnetd
	sets the TERM variable after using TELNET options to discern it
	and then invokes /bin/login with the -p option to preserve this
	setting.

	It would be a good idea to check for duplicates for the
	other variables the /bin/login sets, to prevent future problems.

Subject: earlier /bin/login bug report
Index: bin 4.3BSD

Description:
	The previous bug report I sent was incorrect. The behavior I reported
	was on violet.berkeley.edu, which is not a true 4.3 system.

	Sorry
