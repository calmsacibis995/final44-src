Subject: /bin/mail won't work if from address is too long
Index: bin/mail.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If /bin/mail is called with the -r option (as it is from sendmail)
	with a corresponding address of more than 100 characters, it will
	copy those characters into the space of some of its other variables,
	causing bus errors, or (as we found) infinite loops.
Repeat-By:
	Run /bin/mail -r dp%PALLADIAN-JASPER.LCS.MIT.EDU%BANFF.PALLADIAN.COM%PALLADIAN-JASPER.LCS.MIT.EDU%MIT-LIVE-OAK.ARPA%SRI-KL.ARPA@ames-io.ARPA -d user
	(Yes, this is a common from address for stuff on the UNIX-WIZARDS
	mailing list.)
Fix:
	/bin/mail calls strcpy to copy the from argument into a character
	array.  This is not needed as we can use a pointer instead of an
	array.  Make these changes to mail.c:
	(There is also a fix here for a problem that can only occur if a
	user is in utmp, but mail somehow runs as another user no in the
	password file.)
