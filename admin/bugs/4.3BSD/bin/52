Subject: chgrp prints bogus error messages when using multiple logins per uid
Index: bin/chgrp.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Chgrp(1) does not correctly detect group membership for the second,
	third, etc. login name associated with a given uid (when using
	multiple logins per uid).  This is because it searches the membership
	list of a group for the login name based on the return value of
	getpwuid(getuid()).  This will always result in looking for the first
	login name, not second, third, etc.

	Consequently the kernel (in chown(2)) catches the mistake and returns
	EPERM which results in the bogus message "Not owner"

Repeat-By:
	Duplicate an entry in /etc/passswd, change the login name on the
	second, log in as that user and try to chgrp files belonging to the
	initial login.

Fix:
	Chgrp(1) should check membership in a group the same was the kernel
	does, by looking at the groups returned by getgroups(2).  The necessary
	changes follow, ifdef'ed PURDUE_CS.  Note that groups[] should really
	be of type gid_t but the getgroups(2) system call, like most of the
	kernel and utilities, does not correctly use uid_t and gid_t.
