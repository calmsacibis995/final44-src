Subject: long from: lines break /bin/mail
Index: bin/mail.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Long from: lines cause /bin/mail to loop
Repeat-By:
	Wait for a message that has passed through a lot of relays;
	eg, <@host0,@host1,@host2,...:user@host>.  Info-vax seems
	to occasionally send one of these.
Fix:
	The buffer truename, intended to hold the from address, is
	only 100 chars.  Up it, say to 1000 chars.
