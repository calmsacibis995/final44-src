Sorry I can't find an official bug form around...

The routine load2td in bin/ld.c on the 4.3BSD tape (and, I believe,
on the 4.2 tape as well) has a parameter name/declaration mis-match.
It's okay if sizeof(int) == sizeof(long), but I don't know why it
wasn't until compiling CLE Pyramid C compiler that I noticed this...
(And while I'm here, when will bin/ld.c be split up into subfiles? :-)
