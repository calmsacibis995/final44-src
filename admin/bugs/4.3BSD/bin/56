Subject: "Stopped" is a misnomer
Index: bin 4.3BSD

Description:
	Suggestion: Change the csh message "Stopped" to "Suspended".
	Many times, I've found new users confused by the message
	"Stopped".  They think (and I can understand why) that 
	"Stopped" means terminated.  I've even found users who
	will use ^Z to exit from various programs.  
	   Perhaps every other place where "STOP" occurs it should
	be replaced by "SUSPEND" or "SUSP".  (signals, kill, etc.)
