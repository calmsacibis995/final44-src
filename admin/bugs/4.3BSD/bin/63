Some sites who are paranoid about getting fingered for wasting computer
resources on game-playing like to restrict access on things like netnews and
other games, so when run programs out of the box (like rn) that don't
setgid(getgid()), you end up seeing the message:

	csh: Permission denied

I wasn't sufficiently bugged about it until today, but I did find the
following hunk of code deep within .../bin/csh/sh.c

	if (!batch && (uid != geteuid() || getgid() != getegid())) {
		errno = EACCES;
		child++;			/* So this ... */
		Perror("csh");			/* ... doesn't return */
	}

Now why bother to put this in?  Y'all didn't put a piece of equivalent code in
/bin/sh.  This is a very short-sighted approach to security.

Anyway, how about publishing a diff to take this out, Keith?
