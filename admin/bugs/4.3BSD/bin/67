Subject: some simple /bin/mail bugs

Description:
	There are two bugs in /bin/mail (version 4.27) associated with
	figuring out the users login name; getpwnam() is called with
	the wrong argument and its return value is referenced as a
	pointer even when the call fails.

	Also, there is a call to the sys5 strcmpn().
Repeat-By:
	Compile mail.c on a Sun and run it. Because getpwnam() is
	called with my_name (which is empty) instead of name, it
	returns nil. Getpwnam() returns nil and the program bombs
	on the next line when the nil pointer is referenced.
Fix:
	A diff follows.
