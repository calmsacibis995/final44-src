Subject: /bin/su syslog's the wrong thing
Index: 	bin/su 4.3BSD

Description:
	On the CAD group machine many people use pseudo-ports and are
	not listed in /etc/utmp.  When they su, we get a blank name
	because it does a getlogin() instead of getting the real uid.
Repeat-By:
	su from a port that /etc/utmp doesn't list you as logged on...
	OR, su from an rsh...
Fix:
	Easy, do one of the following:
	Add the real uid's name to the syslog (already stored in buf).
	Here's a diff of the latest source (su 5.3):

100,101c100,101
< 			syslog(LOG_CRIT, "BAD SU %s on %s",
< 					getlogin(), ttyname(2));
---
> 			syslog(LOG_CRIT, "BAD SU %s (%s) on %s",
> 					getlogin(), buf, ttyname(2));
108c108,109
< 		syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s on %s", getlogin(), ttyname(2));
---
> 		syslog(LOG_NOTICE, "%s (%s) on %s",
> 				getlogin(), buf, ttyname(2));
	
	Or you can just change the  getlogin()  's to  buf  in the above lines.
