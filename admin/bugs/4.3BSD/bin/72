Subject: ^Z while sourcing a file causes csh to get its knickers in a knot
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

Description:
	A ^Z typed to csh while it is sourcing a file will cause the shell
	to wedge up.

Repeat-By:
	Create a file containing the following command:
		cat /usr/dict/words
	From csh, source the file.
	Type a ^Z while it's running.
	The shell will wedge.

	The same problem applies if a ^Z is typed while csh is processing a
	.login file.
