Index: bin/make/files.c 4.3BSD

Having spent the last couple of months upgrading two 11/750s to 4.3BSD, I
have encountered a few minor bugs which I have fixes for. Here's one in make.

Problem:	There is a feature of make which is used quite often at this
		site which has had a long-standing bug. If it is required to
		make software from an ar library, then it is possible to
		make use of the creation dates of the individual object modules
		in the ar file. However, there is a bug in the code due to the
		way in which ar module names are stored, in that they are held
		in character arrays which are space-padded on the right. The
		result is that the library modules are always rebuilt for
		each make run. The patch below replaces these trailing spaces
		with nulls after the name is retrieved from the ar library,
		and prior to comparing it's name with the source file.

Fix:
