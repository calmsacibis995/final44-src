Subject: ls -R is buggy
Index:	bin/ls.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	ls -R occasionally lists files that don't even exist in a
	directory as unreadable.  A specific example: while on ucbcad,
	an ls -R of /usr will eventually yield:

		/usr/adm/billing/bin/adduser unreadable
	
	and adduser does not even exist in .../billing/bin; however it
	does exist in /usr/adm.  Other files on cad will come up like
	this as well.  This also occurs on dali, although with different
	files.  I suspect something other than the code for ls.c, as the
	same code compiled on a different (not ucb) machine caused no
	such problem (this machine has vanilla ultrix with programs dating
	back to late 1983?).

Repeat-By:
	On cad, do /bin/ls -R /usr and watch...

Fix:
	In getdir(...) there is a while loop that calls readdir(...);
	In the body of the while loop a pointer to the afile structure
	is incremented.  Upon exiting this while loop, the pointer is
	pointing to the afile structure AFTER the last used afile structure.
	While most of the code is written with this point in mind, there
	is one place where this point is missed.  Since realloc does not
	(now, or did it ever?) zero out the reallocated memory, this can
	randomly cause a problem ( It turned out that I compiled this on
	a different machine and realloc seemed to zero out the reallocated
	memory and thus made ls work, but this is not really the problem).

	the simple diff is shown below:

	206c206
	< 		for (fp = dfplast - 1; fp >= dfp0; fp--) {
	---
	> 		for (fp = dfplast; fp >= dfp0; fp--) {
