Subject: f77 bug: 4.3bsd UNIX f77 improperly handles character constants
Index: bin/f77 4.3BSD


	Has anyone see this problem before and do they have a fix for
    it?

	As stated in the document `A Portable Fortran 77 Compiler' on
    pages 18 and 19 (Section 3.3 PARAMETER Statement) A character
    constant may be declaired with an implied length of (*), this does
    not work with f77, see sample program below. The sample program
    should compile according to the manual and the standard. This
    program will work if I replace `(*)' with `(15)'.

	   CHARACTER *(*) TSTSTR
	   PARAMETER ( TSTSTR = 'This is a test.' )

	   WRITE ( 6, 99999 ) TSTSTR
	   STOP

    99999  FORMAT ( A )
	   END

    Error on line 3 of test.f: Declaration error for tststr: illegal adjustable length character variable

    Error.  No assembly.
