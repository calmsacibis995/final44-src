Subject: /bin/mail dies when -r specifies and address longer than 100 chars
Index: bin/mail.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If sendmail (or anyone for that matter) passes a ``true name'' to
	/bin/mail (via it's "-r" flag) which is longer than 100 characters
	mail dies with a segmentation fault.

	Actually we've also seen mail loop infinitely sometimes which is
	amazing since passing a true name longer than 100 characters
	causes the routine bulkmail's stack frame to be over written
	which one would think would be an almost guaranteed death.  It's
	probably overwriting it's longjmp buffer or some such.  Wasn't
	interested enough to investigate.
Repeat-By:
	Use /bin/mail to someone using the "-d" flag to make it deliver
	and the "-r" flag specifying a true name longer than 100
	characters and watch it die.
