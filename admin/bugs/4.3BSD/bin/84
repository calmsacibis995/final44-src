Subject: csh problem with nested "if's"
Index: bin/csh 4.3BSD

The following is a distillation of a problem that
annoyed me for quite a while, till I found the bug:
(this exhibits the same behavior on 4.2 and 4.3 csh)

#! /bin/csh -f

	if($1 == 1) then
		echo 1 dollarsign one should equal 1, = $1
	endif
	if($1 == 1) then
		echo Can you say foobar.
		if(-e /etc/passwd) then
			echo 2 dollarsign one should equal 1, = $1
		endif
		echo 3 dollarsign one should equal 1, = $1
	endif

If you put this in the file "bug" and run it, you get:

	% bug 1
	1 dollarsign one should equal 1, = 1
	Can you say foobar.
	2 dollarsign one should equal 1, = 1
	3 dollarsign one should equal 1, = 1
	% bug 2
	3 dollarsign one should equal 1, = 2
If you put a space after the 3rd "if", i.e.:
		if (-e /etc/passwd) then
then the script runs correctly, that is "bug 2" does not
print anything.

I don't think this is appropriate behavior for csh.

Soo... if any kind soul has encountered this "undocumented feature"
and has a fix for the csh source, I would appreciate the help.
Thanks!!
