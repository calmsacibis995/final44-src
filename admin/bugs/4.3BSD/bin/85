Description:
          This bug is checked only on a Vax.  It may exist on other systems
        on which dereferencing a null pointer yields a null string.
          "/bin/login" can be fooled up to think it is called from "rlogind",
        and in this case it found the host name to be a null-string.  Also,
        an empty line in ".rhosts" is considered by "ruserok()" to to be a
        null-string host name.

          It happens on our Vaxes that many users have such empty lines.
        Some users use them to separate groups of hosts (for readability).
        Others use "emacs", and don't note when they have blank lines at the
        end of their ".rhosts".

          You can login without a password, from the "getty" "login:"
        prompt, to accounts with a blank line in ".rhosts", by suplying
        the -r flag, and then enter the remote login protocol as an input
        to "/bin/login".

Repeat-By:
          On some account, say "testacct", create a ".rhosts" file with an
        empty (not even with blanks) line in it (and possible other non-empty
        lines).  If you create the file as superuser, note the chown it
        appropriately.

          From the "getty" "login:" prompt, enter

        -rCR            (CR - carriage return)

          Then enter the following:

        testacct^@testacct^@ttyname^@^D         (note the control characters)

        You now logged in as user "testacct".
Fix:
        I fixed only "login.c" (the fix is a hack, but seems sufficient.
        You may found a better/cleaner fix).  "ruserok()" may also be fixed
        to skip empty lines.
