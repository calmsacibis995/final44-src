Description:
	Here we have Joe User who has had an alias
		alias ls '/bin/ls -F'
	installed in his .login by his "friends" (or Prof).
	He types in a 200 line FORTRAN program and compiles it
		% f77 -o foo foo.f
		MAIN...
	runs it as
		% foo
		...
	and does an
		% ls
		foo*	foo.f
	and removes it as
		% rm foo*
	because /bin/ls -F uses '*' to denote executable.

	Could we change this?

Repeat-By:
	See above.
Fix:
	change the '*' to '%' or something.
