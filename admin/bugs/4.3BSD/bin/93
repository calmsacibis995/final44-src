Subject: /bin/sh botches `xxx` if stdout is closed
Index: 	bin/sh 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If the standard output is closed, /bin/sh doesn't handle the `xxx`
	construction correctly: output from xxx is discarded.
Repeat-By:
	Try this at your terminal:

		% /bin/sh
		$ exec >&-
		$ echo `echo x` >&2
	
	The output should be 'x' but is empty.
