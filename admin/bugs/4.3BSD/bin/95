If you do:

	cd /tmp
	mkdir foo
	cd foo
	ln -s /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/motd

what should "ln" do?  I can think of two possibilities:

	1) make three symlinks in the current directory, to the three
	   files in question

	2) complain that, if you give it more than two arguments, the
	   last argument must be a directory.

Unfortunately, what it *does* do is to try to make "/etc/motd" a
symlink to "/etc/passwd" and then try to make "/etc/group" a symlink
to "/etc/motd".

What is the official position of the University of California at Berkeley
on this?
