Description:
	Under some circumstances, awk scribbles over some internal
	data.  After this happens, results are unpredictable.  You may
	simply get incorrect output, you may get no output, or you may
	get a core dump.  The results depend on both the input and how
	the output is redirected.  Surprisingly, output to a file and
	to a pipe are NOT equivalent in this case.

	In the example below (which has been reduced to uselessness to
	simplify reporting) words from the dictionary will appear on
	the screen until about the CO's at which point awk will dump
	core.  If the output is directed to a file, the core dump will
	occur before any output is written to the file.

Repeat-By:
	#! /bin/sh
	awk '
	# look for delimiter to separate articles, originally was /^From/
	/oo/	{
		if (WantToPrint>0) printf("%s", SavedArticle);
		SavedArticle=""; WantToPrint=0;
		}
	# keyword which, if found in article, requests printing of article
	/x/	{
		WantToPrint=1;
		}
	# gather up lines in case article is to be printed
		{
		SavedArticle = SavedArticle $0 "\n"
		}
	' </usr/dict/words

Fix:
	Sorry, that's your department.
