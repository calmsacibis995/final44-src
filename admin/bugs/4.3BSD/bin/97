Subject: A "horrible" bug in sh "if"
Index: bin/sh 4.3BSD

Description:
          The "if" statement apparently checks the status of the last
        child ended.  This caused strange "unrepeatble" problems in
        our /etc/rc, because we had there a background process that
        sometimes exited with status 1, and caused unpredictable "if"
        after it to fail (also sometimes).
Repeat-By:
        Create the shown shell script.  On Vax780 and Vax785 (checked
        with no or light load) the "date" command sometimes ends
        before the "test" command, and then "Not found" is printed.

#!/bin/sh
date x& # supposed to exit 1
if [ -f /etc/passwd ]
then
        echo Found
else
        echo Not found
fi
