SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
binmail(1) man page broken

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500

MODULE NAME:

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The + and -i options don't exist.
Furthermore, the man page is not very descriptive as to what /bin/mail
actually does.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Try the options!

SUGGESTED FIX:

Temporary fix:
Remove the above options from the man page, and add the -q and -p options
that do exist (-q for not continuing after interrupts, and -p to print out
the contents of mail like /usr/ucb/prmail).

Better fix:
Rewrite the man page entirely.  

OTHER COMMENTS:
It should be noted that the + option as described in the current man page
can be easily added to the command.  The code for this option is already
there, it's just that the option is not recognized when parsing.

Then there are the -r and -d options used to do the actual mail delivery.
Altering another user's mail box requires special privileges which is 
accomplished by using the set userid feature.  However, since this command
is directly available to the user, anyone can send mail to someone
else's mail box, pretending to be yet another user.  The Unix mail facility 
is obviously not secure at all.  The problem stems from the fact that 
/bin/mail is used both as a user interface and the actual mail deliverer.  
A possible solution is to separate the deliverer from the user interface,
not allowing the user to get to the deliverer directly.
