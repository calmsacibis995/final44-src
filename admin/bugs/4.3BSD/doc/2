Subject: Most MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) /usr/doc Makefiles are broken
#Index: `find /usr/doc -name Makefile -print` MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: doc 4.3BSD

Description:
	Most Makefiles in the /usr/doc directory try, by default,
	to use programs that are not distributed with MORE/bsd 4.3
	(for example, ditroff and dtbl).

Repeat-By:
	Use the sh command
		for i in `find /usr/doc -type d -links 2 -print`
		do
			cd $i ; make
		done
	on an as-distributed MORE/bsd 4.3 system.

Fix:
	Either provide ditroff and dtbl or eliminate the explicit references
	to them in the Makefiles (and the use of the features these programs
	provide in the files that are used to create the documentation).
