Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 "INET" configuration option isn't (with documentation fix)
Index: doc/smm/02.config/[45].t 4.3BSD

Description:
	MORE/bsd 4.3's "INET" configuration option is required for the
	"sendmail" command to work.  MORE/bsd 4.3's "/bin/mail" and
	"/bin/rmail" commands use "sendmail" to do their dirty work.
	And MORE/bsd 4.3's "/usr/lib/crontab" file contains entries that
	end up executing the "/bin/mail" command.  So system installers
	can only successfully leave out the "INET" option if they take other
	steps as well--and these steps are not documented anywhere.

Repeat-By:
	Configuring and running a system without the "INET" option
	and observing the consequences.

Fix:
	Here are the minimal diffs required to point system installers in
	the right direction.  An alternative is to fix sendmail so that it
	works on systems built without the INET option; given the nature of
	sendmail, this documentation change seems far easier.  Another
	possibility is always to include the INET code in kernels,
	and eliminate references to INET from the documentation.

  Note that unlike 4.2BSD configuration files,
  the network protocol options do not require corresponding pseudo devices.
