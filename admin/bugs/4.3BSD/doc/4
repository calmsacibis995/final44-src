Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) nroff code and writeups don't jive
Index: 	doc/usd/24.troff 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "Alphabetical Request and Section Number Cross Reference" on page 5
	of the "NROFF/TROFF User's Manual" indicates that an "li" directive is
	described in section 10.  There is no description of the "li" directive
	in section 10, nor is the "li" directive summarized on page 4.
	The "li" directive (which causes 1 line, or N lines if a value is given,
	to be treated as text even if they begin with a . or ') is supported
	by nroff/troff.

	A "cf" (copy file unchanged to the output, a la ".cf filename")
	directive is supported by nroff/troff but is not described in the User's
	Manual.

	A "ht" (hyphenation threshhold) directive is supported by nroff/troff
	but is not described in the User's Manual.

Fix:
	Either remove the code for the "li", "cf" and "ht" directives
	(and delete the reference to "li" in the "Alphabetical Request and
	Section Number Cross Reference") or add documentation for them to the
	User's Manual.
