Subject: Sendmail
Index: doc 4.3BSD

Description:
	There is an inconsitency between man sendmail -bz and the
	Sendmail installation guide.  The former says that the -bz
	option create the configuration frozen file.  The latter
	says that to install the frozen version of the configuration
	file you should create it first and *then* use sendmail -bz.
Fix:
	Man of Installation Guide should be ammended
