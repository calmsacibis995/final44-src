Subject: Nameserver and resolver library.
Index:	etc/named 4.3BSD

Description:
	The named(aemon) doesn't include the netlib library, so it doesn't
	build properly.  I also looked through the code and the version we
	have doesn't contain any of the fixes we have.  They are too extensive
	to list.

	Also the netlib doesn't include all the correct modules.  (i.e. when
	a test program is compiled and linked with this library, it doesn't
	load.  When I corrected the load step in the Makefile, it produces
	a program which still looks in /etc/hosts.)

	I suggest copying our working version of both the resolver library
	and the nameserver from our sources.

	Get back to me if you care.


Repeat-By:
	cd /src/etc/named; make

	cd /src/lib/libc/net; make

Fix:
	Fix the Makefile in libc to include the right things in the right
	order.

	Take an entire copy from Athena.
