SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE: 
passwd command can corrupt /etc/passwd a little bit if there is a 
missing colon at end of user password record.

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.2
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080 

Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	passwd

SPR TYPE: 
	software

PRIORITY:
	5

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	if you leave off a colon at end of password file record and the 
	last field is not null there is a newline in that information field

		username:*:999:999:stuff:/mnt/homedir
					   	     ^
						     |
					             no colon, but newline

	that gets written into the /etc/passwd file from /bin/passwd program

		fprintf(tf,"%s:%s:%d:%d:%s:%s:%s\n",
			pwd->pw_name,
			pwd->pw_passwd,
			pwd->pw_uid,
			pwd->pw_gid,
			pwd->pw_gecos,
			pwd->pw_dir,		<- newline in this field
			pwd->pw_shell);

	which results in a 2 line entry that looks like

		username:*:999:999:stuff:/mnt/homedir
		:

	(note: pw_shell does not require a colon at end of field).

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:
	add a user using vipw, but do not use all the fields and do not
	end the password record with a colon.

	give the user a password using /bin/passwd.

	look at password record again.
		
SUGGESTED FIX:
	vipw should verify that _all_ /etc/passwd file records 
	are in proper format.
