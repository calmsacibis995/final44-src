Subject: a "safe" cm= entry for Hazeltine 1500
Subject: Hazeltine 1500 cm= entry is "unsafe"

Description:
	Sending control chars for cursor moves causes no end of troubles.
Repeat-By:
	use :cm=~^Q%r%.%.:
Fix:
	replace it with :cm=~^Q%r%>^^ %+`%+`: (attribute it to me, cgs@umd5)
	This takes advantage of the fact that the libtermcap routines
	strip off the high-order bits so that \200 becomes \000. Without
	the high-order bit stripping, it would be necessary to add a '%<xy'
	termcap format in cm to make it "safe".
	Note: the Haz1500 does not want receive anything greater than \126
	      for cursor movement.
