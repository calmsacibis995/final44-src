Subject: tunefs should allow negative rotdelay

Index: etc/tunefs.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Although it sounds stupid, negative rotational delays are
	actually useful.  According to Don Speck, negative rotdelay
	works `as expected ...

		I.e. instead of this layout:
		    1 - - - 2   trk 1
		    - - - 3 -   trk 2
		    - - 4 - -   trk 3
		    - 5 - - -   trk 4
		you get this layout:
		    5 4 3 2 1'

	This should help performance on disks like RA81s, which have
	head switch delays (6ms on the RA81!).

Repeat-by:
	`tunefs -d -16 /usr'

Fix:
	below

Chris
