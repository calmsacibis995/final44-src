Subject: disklabel can only handle one `flags'

Index: etc/disklabel.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Attempting to edit the label on an RP06 produces

		line 5: unknown flag "removeable badsect"

	(or similar).

Repeat-by:
	% disklabel -w hp0 rp06
	% disklabel -e hp0
	...
	:wq

Fix:
	The code is depending upon `word' to break up the flag
	words, but word is called *after* all the comparisons,
	when it is too late.

	Incidentally, I also get errors from the internal disk
	label writing code, claiming that sector zero gives an IAE.
	Apparently the label gets written anyway.  Very odd.
