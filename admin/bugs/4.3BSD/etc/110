Subject: /etc/init dereferences null pointer + FIX
Index: etc/init.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	/etc/init dereferences a null pointer causing havoc on some systems

Repeat-By:
	Run it on a machine that either disallows null pointer dereferences
	or doesn't have a NULL at location 0 (this counts Vaxen out).

	If your machine allows NULL pointer dereferences and don't have a NULL
	at location 0, you will get a lot of bogus getty's fired up
	and then killed, and then fired up again, repeatedly until
	you get bored with it all and reboot the machine.   If you're
	lucky you might even get a getty that you can use to login with.

	If your machine disallows NULL pointer dereferences you will
	probably get a "panic: init died" message as soon as the machine
	attempts to go multi-user.

Fix:
	The getttyent(3) routine can return the ty_window field as a NULL
	pointer (and most probably will on most machines).  This is
	documented behaviour and not a bug, but the authors of the
	4.3 mods to /etc/init obviously didn't account for this behaviour.
	A vax gets away with this because a NULL is at location 0.

	Apply the following patch to init.c:
