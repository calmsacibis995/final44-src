Subject: Followup to rexec bug: rexecd
Index: etc 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Rexecd reads a short off of it's socket instead of an
	unsigned short.  It will not function if ports are > 32K 
	(not 16K, what was I thinking?).
Repeat-By:
	Use rexec when system ports are over 32767.  It will fail quietly.
Fix:
	Change at line 77 in etc/rexecd.c:
		short port;
	to 
		unsigned short port;
