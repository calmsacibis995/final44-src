Subject: getty bug
Index: etc/getty/main.c 4.3BSD

There is a small open window in getty where a SIGINT can cause a longjmp to
a jmp_buf which was made in a subroutine that has exited. THe result is a
core dump. THe problem is in the routine getname() in src/etc/getty/main.c
which does a setjmp which is longjmp'ed to by a handler for SIGINT.
However there is a place in getname() where SIGINT is not set to SIG_IGN
before returning to the caller.
