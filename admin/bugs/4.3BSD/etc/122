Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 mount uses wrong permissions for mountee's root directory
#Index: etc/mount MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: etc/mount 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a file system is mounted, the wrong permissions are used when
	referencing the parent directory of the root of the mounted file
	system.

Repeat-By:
	Type in the commands
		mkdir /mountpoint
		chmod 0 /mountpoint
		/etc/mount /dev/any-old-file-system /mountpoint
		chmod 555 /mountpoint
		cat < /mountpoint/..
	and note the output:
		/mountpoint/..: Permission denied

	Compare with the description of the effect of a mount(2) call on
	the manual page:

		. . .After a successful return, references to directory dir will
		refer to the root directory on the newly mounted file system.

	The above "cat" is the simplest way to show up the problem;
	note, though, that more realistic command sequences such as

		cd /mountpoint ; pwd

	also cause problems.

Fix:
	Who knows?  A workaround, at least with respect to the failure
	of commands such as "pwd", is to avoid mounting file systems on
	directories with restrictive permissions; it suffices to, for example,

		chmod 555 /mountpoint

	before doing a mount.
