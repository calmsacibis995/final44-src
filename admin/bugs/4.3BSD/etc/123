Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 syslogd drops console messages on floor (with fix)
Index: etc/syslogd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	MORE/bsd 4.3's syslogd program drops the first message written to
	the console on the floor, as well as the first message following
	each console logout.
	
Repeat-By:
	Immediately after rebooting the system, log in as root.
	Note the absence of a "ROOT LOGIN" message on /dev/console.

Fix:
	The problem is this:  syslogd notices when a write to /dev/console
	has failed because of a vhangup, and reopens /dev/console--but forgets
	to rewrite the message that it was unable to write.

	Maybe syslogd should retry more than the one time provided for by the
	addition below.
