Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 catman sometimes fails to remove files (with fix)
Index: etc/catman.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The catman command sometimes fails to remove files,
	leading to "symlink" complaints.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Sun Mar  8 21:28:15 1987
	$ cd /tmp
	$ mkdir man1 cat1
	$ echo .so man1/beta.1 > man1/alpha.1
	$ echo hello > man1/beta.1
	$ /etc/catman -M /tmp 1
	$ touch man1/*
	$ /usr/ucb/man -M /tmp beta
	Reformatting page.  Wait...^C aborted (sorry)
	$ /etc/catman -M /tmp 1
	catman: symlink: cat1/alpha.1: File exists
	$ 
	script done on Sun Mar  8 21:29:38 1987

	The above is, of course, a simplified version of a real life scenario
	where:
		1.  catman gets run in the wee hours of the night
		    (first catman above)
		2.  Some manual page editing gets done during the day
		    (touch command above)
		3.  A user tries to run off a manual page
		    (the man command above) but, disgruntled with slow
		    system response, interrupts out of the man command
		    (^C above)--which causes the man command to remove
		    the (possibly incomplete) cat1/beta.1 file.
		4.  catman gets run in the wee hours of the next night
		    (second catman above)

Fix:
	Well, perhaps that code I was suspicious of in my last note really
	does need fixing.  Yes, the reversal of the sense of the test is
	deliberate.
