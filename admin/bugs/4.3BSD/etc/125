Good idea.  If you do it, you might want to expand the comment in /etc/shells
that reads

      # List of acceptable shells for chsh/passwd -s
      # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who do not have one of these shells

to warn about the new use of the file by vipw.  (This, of course, in addition
to the usual changes to the vipw(8) manual page.)  Maybe

      # List of acceptable shells for chsh/passwd -s
      # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who do not have one of these shells
      # Vipw will gripe if "root" has a shell other than one of these shells
