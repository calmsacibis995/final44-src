Subject: chown command fails to catch bad usage (w/fix)
Index: etc/chown.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	In some situations the chown command fails to give an error message
	when used incorrectly.

Repeat-By:
	For fans of real world usage:
		Script started on Tue Nov  3 18:59:13 1987
		$ /bin/su
		Password:
		# loginname=mtxinu
		# echo hi > try
		# chown ingres try
		# ls -l try
		-rw-r--r--  1 ingres          3 Nov  3 19:00 try
		# chown "$loginame" try
		# ls -l try
		-rw-r--r--  1 root            3 Nov  3 19:00 try
		# exit
		$ exit

		script done on Tue Nov  3 19:00:30 1987
	
	Or, for fans of minimalism,

		chown "" filename

	and note that root is made the owner of the file in question.

Fix:
		*** 3.1/chown.c	Tue Nov  3 19:10:06 1987
		--- 3.2/chown.c	Tue Nov  3 19:10:08 1987
		***************
		*** 104,109 ****
		--- 104,111 ----
		  {
			register c;
		  
		+ 	if (*s == '\0')
		+ 		return 0;
			while(c = *s++)
				if (!isdigit(c))
					return (0);

	Alternately (but less preferably in the view of your correspondent)
	document the behavior of the chown command when used with a null
	"owner" argument.
