MODULE NAME: quot

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low) 5

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:  Running /etc/quot on Fang, Al or Dolly will
not be correct for the user.  E.g., on Dolly /etc/quot /dev/rdk1d,
reports 60 blocks for user smith.  I did a find /mnt -user smith
-print, piped this into a du -s, which reported user smith had 202
blocks.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT: See me, I have hard copies.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
