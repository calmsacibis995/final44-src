DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
If a system has been configured for 128 terminals, the rwho daemon will not
recognize the ptys on the system.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Configure the system for 128 terminals, log into the system over the
network and do a rwho (after a little time passes).
You will see that you are not listed.
SUGGESTED FIX:
in the rwhod.c file change the struct utmp utmp[100] to utmp[192].  This
will allow for 128 terminals and 64 ptys.

Note also that there is a limit of ~40 users who will appear
in an rwho for a given machine, due to the use of a single,
fixed-size block for sending the data.  This is broken.  Does
4.3 fix it?
