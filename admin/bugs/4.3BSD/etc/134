SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	error in nextline() of inetd

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	/etc/inetd

BUG PORTED TO UTX?

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	I noticed this as I was browsing through the inetd code.
	It is not really a `bug', yet, in that it fortuitously
	has the correct effect, but it could become a bug if 
	inetd is modified or extended.

	In the following function the argument `fd' is not used at all.
	This is because it is always called nextline(fconfig).

	char *
	nextline(fd)
		FILE *fd;
	{
		char *cp;

		if (fgets(line, sizeof (line), fconfig) == NULL)
					       ^^^^^^^
			return ((char *)0);
		cp = index(line, '\n');
		if (cp)
			*cp = '\0';
		return (line);
	}

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
	Either change fconfig to fd in the body of the function,
	or remove the argument to nextline from its declarations
	and invocations. The latter will produce a small speedup. 

OTHER COMMENTS:
	From small acorns grow mighty oaks.
