SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:
	rwhod hangs if no network interfaces have been configured

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	/etc/rwhod

BUG PORTED TO UTX? 
	yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	Rwhod hangs if no network interfaces have been configured.
	Hanging can happen, if at boot time, from the rc.local file,
	rwhod is started before ifconfig is called.

SUGGESTED FIX:
	Change the lines from:

		if (!configure(s))
			exit(1);

	to the lines:

		if (!configure(s) || neighbors == 0)
		{
			fprintf(stderr, "No configured network interfaces exist");
			exit(1);
		}

OTHER COMMENTS:
	I have also entered this bug against UTX 2.0.
