Subject: ftpd debugging mode has problems
Index: etc/ftpd/ftpd.c 4.3BSD

Description:

	When debugging mode of ftp is used, the messages logged are not
	similar to what was sent on the connection for replies.  A slight
	possibility of crashing ftpd exists as well.  A sample log entry
	(for the initial connection message) might be:

		ftpd: <--- 220
		ftpd: FTPD:  FTP server () ready.

	The first line is correct.  The second line should be:

		ftpd: FTPD: hostname FTP server (Version # and Date) ready.

	The problem arises here since reply() and lreply() expect a variable
	number of arguments.  The message to the remote user comes correctly
	since _doprnt() is called, but syslog(3) does not understand the
	varargs method of passing the address of the arglist.


Repeat-By:

	Add the -d arg to the ftpd entry in /etc/inetd.conf.  Send
	inetd a hangup signal.  Modify /etc/syslog.conf to log LOG_DEBUG
	message from a DAEMON to a file.  Send syslogd a hangup signal.
	Establish an ftp connection to the host previously modified to
	do the logging.  After completing the session, examine the session
	log.

Fix:
	I haven't coded up a fix and tested it yet, but one approach
	would be to copy sprintf(3) (with some minor modifications)
	into reply() and lreply() and do the call to _doprnt() before 
	before calling syslog().  Sprintf itself can not be used since
	it does not understand varargs.

	A more general approach to fixing the problem might be to
	implement a version of syslog(3) which handles a pointer to
	the arglist.
