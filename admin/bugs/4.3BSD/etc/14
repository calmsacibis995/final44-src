Subject: wyse75 termcap
Index: 	etc/termcap/termcap.src 4.3BSD

Description:
	One of the features of the wyse75 is that it can be set to
	clear the screen when the screen column attribute changes.
	When the "is" string makes sure that the screen is set to 80
	columns, on login, the screen clears, erasing the motd and,
	possibly, other things.

	The second problem is that when "is" sets the scrolling region
	it leaves the cursor at the top of the screen.
Repeat-By:
	Log in on a wyse75, using tset to set your terminal
	characteristics.
Fix:
	Use this "is" instead of the current one.

	:is=\E[1;24r\E[24;1H\E[35;?25h\E[4;?10;3;1l\E[m\E(B\E>:\
