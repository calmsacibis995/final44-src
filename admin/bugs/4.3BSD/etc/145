Repeat-By:
        /etc/arp your_kernel /dev/nosuchmemfile

Details:
All versions of /etc/arp on systems that I have been able to
lay my hands on (VAX BSD 4.2, Sequent DYNIX 3.0, SunOS 3.5,
WCW 42nix 2.6) dump core if given a "mem" argument that is
problematical. In my VAX BSD 4.2 source, the offending line is

        mf = open(mem, 0);
        if(mf < 0) {
                fprintf(fprintf, "arp: cannot open %s\n", mem);
                exit(1);
        }

which should read "fprintf(stderr, ...)". Isn't lint supposed
to spot things like this?!?
