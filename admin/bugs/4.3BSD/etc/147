Subject: another fingerd bug
Index: etc/fingerd 4.3BSD

After all of the virus stuff going around, no doubt many people have been
looking at the fingerd code.  Well, I'm terribly embarrassed to say that on
first reading fingerd I missed the gets() bug.  However, I found
another one that perhaps may be as bad.

In fingerd, The loop

	while (1) {
		...
	}

Does not do bounds checking on the array av, declared as

	char *av[4];

The line "while(1) {"  should be changed to a line similar to

	while (i<4) {

Otherwise someone can send a stream to fingerd like

	"/w /w /w nastystuff"

To overwrite the fingerd object code.  I haven't actually tried to exploit this
and it perhaps is not usable as a security threat.  At the very least however it
is a coding error.

Thought you might want to know, and I apologize if this is the 1,000,000th time
you've seen this (it is not a particularly subtle problem, so *someone* else
must have discovered it!).  However, I haven't seen this made public, and am
debating whether to send it out on the net or not.  As it is, for now I'll
simply wait for a reply from you.
