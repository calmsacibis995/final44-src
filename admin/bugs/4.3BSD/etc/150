Subject: magic number in reboot
Index: etc/reboot.c 4.3BSD
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU

Description:
	syscall(55...) should use SYS_reboot (from <syscall.h>), rather than
	the magic number 55.
Repeat-By:
	The easy way: read the source.
	The hard way (what we did): port Unix to a new architecture
	and shuffle the system calls around so that "reboot" is no
	longer 55.  /etc/reboot will fail.
Fix:
	Use SYS_reboot.
