Subject: fingerd allows third party fingers
Index: etc/fingerd/fingerd.c 4.3BSD +FIX
Date: Wed, 14 Dec 88 14:37:37 PST
From: Craig Leres <leres@helios.ee.lbl.gov>


Description:
	As distributed, fingerd allows third party fingers. This makes
	it impossible for sites who wish to syslog remote finger
	requests to log original site.

Repeat-By:
	Install site logging in fingerd and then do something like:

		% finger @arpa@ucbvax

	The target finger on arpa will look like it was done from
	ucbvax instead of the machine the finger was run on.

Fix:
	Don't allow third party fingers. (Obviously, this only keeps
	your own systems from helping someone do a third party finger,
	but it's a start.)
