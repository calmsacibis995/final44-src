Subject: htable(8) truncates some network names
Index: etc/htable/htable.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	There are about six networks in the hosts.txt file distributed
	by the NIC that are 15 characters or longer.  Htable happily
	runs these into the following network # due to a printf truncation
	that seems uneccessary.
Repeat-By:
	examine your /etc/networks file.  Check the line for
	northeastern-net, which will look like this:

		northeastern-net129.10

	Note the lack of a space.  This will certainly confuse the
	getnet* routines

Fix: context diffs of htable.c follow
