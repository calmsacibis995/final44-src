Subject: nslookup installation somewhat inflexible
Index: 	etc/named/tools/ns.lookup 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The Makefile for nslookup could be easier to configure.  For
	example, rather than saying

	  install ... nslookup ${DESTDIR}/usr/local/nslookup

	it would be better to say

	  BINDEST=${DESTDIR}/usr/local
	  ...
	  install ... nslookup ${BINDEST}/nslookup

	The "help" file should receive similar treatment.

	  HELPDEST=${DESTDIR}/usr/local
	  DEFS=	-DHELPFILE='"${HELPDEST}/nslookup.help"'
	  CFLAGS=	-g ${DEFS} 

	and main.c should define HELPFILE only if it's not yet defined.
Repeat-By:
	n/a
Fix:
	(see Description)
