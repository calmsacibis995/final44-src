Subject: "pstat -p" does not report all procp[].p_flag bits
Index: etc/pstat.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The routine, doproc() ands the integer p_flag field with 0xffff
	before printing.  This is misleading.  I thought I had a kernel
	bug when new flags weren't reported.
Repeat-By:
	pstat -p
Fix:
	Don't and p_flag with 0xffff. Print the flag with %8x rather than
	%4x.  Add 4 spaces before the "F" report header.
