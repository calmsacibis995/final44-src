Subject: FTP assumes a "ftp-bugs" mail alias, which is not included by default
Index: etc 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The help delivered by the FTP daemon (by the remotehelp command) says:
	"214 Direct comments to ftp-bugs@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU."  This alias
	does not exist on most machines.
Repeat-By:
	FTP to some machine, say ucbarpa.  You can skip the login phase.
	Type "remotehelp".  Verify that it directs you to "ftp-bugs".  Note
	that ftp-bugs is not a valid alias on most machines.
Fix:
	Include "ftp-bugs: root" in the standard sendmail alias file.
	Document it in future "Upgrading from 4.3 to 4.4BSD" documents.
