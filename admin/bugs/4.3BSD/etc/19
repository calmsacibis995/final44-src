Subject: FTPD refuses to let /bin/sh users log in
Index: 	etc/ftpd/ftpd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	FTPD refuses to let any user who has /bin/sh as his login shell
	log in through FTP.  This occurs even when /bin/sh is listed
	in /etc/shells.
Repeat-By:
	Make an account whose login shell is /bin/sh (i.e., has no shell
	listed in /etc/passwd).  Try to FTP into that account.
Fix:
	The problem is that the code in chkuser() assumes that it always
	gets a string back from the password file.  But, a null shell
	is defined to be /bin/sh (see passwd(5)); chkuser() ignores this.
	So, just add the simple code below:

	944a945,946
	> 	if ((pw->pw_shell == NULL) || (pw->pw_shell[0] == NULL))
	> 		pw->pw_shell = "/bin/sh";
