Subject: reversed lines in rexecd.c
Index: 	etc/rexecd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The setuid()/setgid() sequence in rexecd.c is reversed.  It does
	the setuid() followed by setgid().  This makes the setgid() a
	no-op (since the program is not root any more at that point).
Fix:
	190d189
	< 	(void) setuid(pwd->pw_uid);
	191a191
	> 	(void) setuid(pwd->pw_uid);
