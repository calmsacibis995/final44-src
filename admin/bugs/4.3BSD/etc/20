Subject: fsck might not realize that it is checking the root file system
Index: 	etc/fsck/main.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Fsck is suppose to use the block device instead of the raw
	device whenever it tries to check the root file system.  It
	does not always do this.
Repeat-By:
	Type
		/etc/fsck /dev/rhp1a
	or whatever you do to check the *raw* root file system.
	Fsck will *not* report that it is checking the root file
	system; nor will it switch over to the block device for
	file system checking.
Fix:
	A diff listing of main.c follows:

	RCS file: RCS/main.c,v
	retrieving revision 1.1
	diff  -r1.1 main.c
	84c84,85
	< 			checkfilesys(*argv++);
	---
	> 			name = blockcheck(*argv++);
	> 			checkfilesys(name);

	< 	if (stblock.st_mode & S_IFBLK) {
	---
	> 	if ((stblock.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFBLK) {
	279c280
	< 		if (stchar.st_mode & S_IFCHR) {
	---
	> 		if ((stchar.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFCHR) {
	289c290
	< 	} else if (stblock.st_mode & S_IFCHR) {
