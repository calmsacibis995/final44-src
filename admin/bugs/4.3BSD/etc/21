Subject: FTP daemon doesn't like Bourne shell users
Index:	etc/ftpd/ftpd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The FTP daemon denies access to users who have the default
	login shell (/bin/sh).
Repeat-By:
	chsh to /bin/sh and then try to FTP to your account.
Fix:
	Ftpd attempts to verify the user's shell against those in
	/etc/shells to prevent accounts like finger from being FTP
	targets.  However, getpwent returns a string with a null
	in it if the shell field is blank and Ftpd tries to compare
	this against /bin/sh and misses.

	This fix avoids the check if the user is using the default system
	shell.  Add the if statement around the getusershell lookup.

	if(*pw->pw_shell != 0) {
		while ((cp = getusershell()) != NULL)
			if (strcmp(cp, pw->pw_shell) == 0)
				break;
		endusershell();
		if (cp == NULL)
			return (0);
	}
