Subject: arff doesn't recognize protected files (4.2, 4.3)
Index: 	etc/arff.c 4.3BSD FIX

Description:
	/etc/arff does not recognize "protected" files on the RT-11
	volume (e.g., floppy).
	(DEC's RT-11 operating system can "protect" files by setting a
	bit in the file's directory entry; the intention is to help
	avoid accidental deletion).
	This bug also exists in 4.2bsd.

Repeat-By:
	Try "arff t" or "arff tv" on a volume containing protected
	files (it will probably have to be made on an RT-11 system).
	Protected files will not be listed.

	Or -- Try "arff x ..." on a protected file; you will get
	"... not found" messages.

	Attempting to use "arff r ..." to add files to such a volume
	would probably result in a disaster.

Fix:
	An RCS rlog and a context diff from the distributed 4.3bsd
	arff.c is below.  Basically, cases were added for protected
	file status.
	Nothing has been done (yet) to indicate protected status in an
	"arff tv" listing; this and some other minor changes will be
	given in a forthcoming bug report.

----------------------------
Added recognition of "protected" file status.  Otherwise, protected
    files are not shown by "arff t", lookups will fail for "arff x",
    and disaster will probably ensue for "arff r".
Requires fix to type declarations -- rt_stat byte must be unsigned
    (protection bit is high-order bit; switch fails otherwise due to
    sign extension).
Also made rt_chan unsigned (channels are 0-255), although it is unused
    here.
