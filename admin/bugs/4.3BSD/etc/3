Subject: rshd doesn't allow access if the password is null
Index: 	etc/rshd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Rshd always checks the .rhosts when verifying if the user can
	access the account, even if the account has a null password.
Repeat-By:
	Create an account with an empty (::) password.  You will be able
	to remotely log into it, but not remotely execute commands.
Fix:
170c170,171
< 	if (ruserok(hp->h_name, pwd->pw_uid == 0, remuser, locuser) < 0) {
---
> 	if (pw->pw_passwd != 0 && *pw->pw_passwd != '\0' &&
> 	    ruserok(hp->h_name, pwd->pw_uid == 0, remuser, locuser) < 0) {
