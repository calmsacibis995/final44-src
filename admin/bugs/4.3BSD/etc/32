Subject: Builtin udp chargen function of inetd generates garbage
Index: etc/inetd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The internal chargen function of inetd is supposed to generate
	a shifting pattern everytime it sends a packet.  This works until
	the pattern starts to wrap around.  Then the same pattern gets
	generated.
	The stream version of chargen will send a couple of garbage bytes
	(usually a null and a space) and doesn't send a full line (72).
	There is also a small problem with the daytime functions: they
	send the internet standard newline as \n\r instead of \r\n as it
	should be.
Repeat-By:
	Write a little program to send and receive datagram packets to the
	chargen/udp port.  Then send and receive about 17 packets.
	To test daytime and the stream version of chargen, do:
	"telnet localhost 13 | cat -v" (or 19 instead of 13).
Fix:
	Here is a diff of the fixes to make:
