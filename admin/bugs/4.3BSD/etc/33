Subject: Inetd can cause a rlogin shell to fail
Index: etc/inetd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If inetd is started from a shell not associated with a terminal
	its process group is non-zero.  It passes this process group on
	to rlogind, which then opens the pty on which the login shell
	will run.  Since the pgrp is non-zero, the process will not
	become "attached" to this pty, which will cause csh to fail.
Repeat-By:
	# rsh <host> -l root exec csh -i
	(Find the pid of the existing inetd and kill it)
	# kill <pid>
	# /etc/inetd
	# exit
	Now, try to rlogin to <host> on an account with csh as the login
	shell.  The shell will immediately exit.
Fix:
	In inetd.c, if open("/dev/tty", O_RDWR) fails, call setpgrp() to
	set the process group to zero.
