Subject: ftpd gets out of sync with client after LIST or NLST command
Index: etc 4.3BSD

Description:
	If you enter the command 'ls xxx' from the client, and xxx does not
	exist in the current directory on the server side, the /bin/ls
	'file not found' stderr message comes back over the control connection,
	causing the command/reply pattern to go out of sync.

	The client is expecting a single reply, but it gets the 'file not
	found' message and the ftp command complete reply.
Repeat-By:
	Try it. Commands after the 'ls xxx' will have out of sync replies
	that will prevent correct ftp actions. The user must quit or issue
	a 'quote NOOP' followed by a 'reset' (on 4.3 ftp).
