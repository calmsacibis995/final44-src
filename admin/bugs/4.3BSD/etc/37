Subject: ftpd gets out of sync with 4.3 client after LIST or NLST command
Index: etc 4.3BSD

Description:
	ftpd uses /bin/ls to respond to LIST and NLST commnds. The 4.3 inetd
	setup results in /bin/ls error messages coming back over the
	ftp control connection. This unexpected reply violates the ftp
	protocol and will mess up the ftp client.
Repeat-By:
	Using a 4.3 client, log on to a 4.3 ftpd. Enter the command 'ls xxx',
	where 'xxx' is a filename that is NOT in the current directory on
	the server machine. You'll see the /bin/ls "file not found message".
	Enter another 'ls' command. You'll see the ftp "Transfer completed"
	reply meant for the previous "ls" command processed by the client as
	if it came in reply to the new PORT command for the new 'ls'
	command. The client and server are out of sync.
Fix:
	The simplest fix is to close the stderr stream in ftpd. This will
	make things look like they used to.
	Since ftpd uses syslog() for error reporting, this change won't
	affect anything else.

	Stderr should be closed on the server, because the ftp protocol
	requires that no unexpected messages come back over the control
	connection.

	As a suggestion that would require a little programming, it may be
	"nicer" if ftpd detected when no files would be found by the ls
	command and sent back a ftp protocol "file not found" reply, instead
	of letting the user interpret a null data transfer as a sign that
	no matching files were found.
