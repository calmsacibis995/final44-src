Subject: telnetd won't pass <CR> to the pty
Index: etc/telnetd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
    It turns out that telnetd (the program all of your keystrokes go
    through when you login through a Bridge or other telnet connection)
    maps <CR>-<LF> to a plain <LF>.  What this means is that there is no
    way for you to get a <CR> to Unix if you go through telnetd.  And that
    explains why:

	C-kermit will not transfer files over a bridge connection,
	because the end-of-packet char (<CR>) from your local kermit
	is getting changed to an <LF>, and C-kermit on the vax expects
	a <CR> (you can get around this by getting into kermit and
	setting the receive end-of-packet char to 10 (<LF>)).

	Outgoing kermit and tip connections from login sessions
	that come through telnetd will not work properly when
	you attempt to connect to systems which require a <CR>
	as the end-of-line char (e.g. a local TELENET port,
	or the bridge itself, etc.).  The same such connections
	made over a PUP-telnet or a hard-wired (or rlogin) connection
	are able to pass <CR>'s through, and don't suffer from this
	problem.

Repeat-By:
	Make a telnet connection to the machine (4.3bsd VAX 750)
	tip "local machine/OS which requires <CR>"
	Press <CR> and watch nothing happen (it may be echoed
	    as a newline or ^J and/or ignored).
	
    Or:

	Write a program that reads characters from its tty device
	    after putting it in raw or cbreak mode and somehow keeps
	    a log of the characters it receives.
	Make a telnet connection to the machine the program is on,
	    and run the program.
	Type characters and <CR>'s.
	Examine the log of chars received by the program, and note
	    that all the <CR>'s you typed were replaced by <LF>'s..


Suggestion (no fix):

    It may be simple to hack telnetd to map <CR>-<LF>'s to <CR>'s instead,
    but I am not certain what would break if that were done.  Does anyone
    else think this is a "bug" and has anyone "fixed" it?  Our users are
    quite confused by this behavior, and I'm having difficulty explaining
    why telnet pty's behave differently than rlogin pty's (and hardware
    tty's).
