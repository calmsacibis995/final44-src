Subject: Scrolling region definition needed in xterm termcap description
Index: etc/termcap/termcap.src 4.3BSD

Description:
	The xterm terminal emulator has a scrolling region capability ala
	VT100's, but the termcap description for xterm doesn't include
	a scrolling region definition.  This lack causes many screen
	oriented programs (like text editors) to scroll extremely slowly.
Repeat-By:
	Get into jove on either a uVAX II or a Sun-3 and attempt to delete
	ten lines in the middle of a window.  Emacs will demonstrate the
	problem also.
Fix:
	Add the define ":cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:" to the xterm termcap definition.
