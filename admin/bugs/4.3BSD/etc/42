Subject: ping is going crazy!  take a look today while it is still true
Index: etc 4.3BSD

Description:
	ping is taking massive amounts of cpu time (>50% as 
	shown by systat).   I have know idea why ping would 
	change it's behavior... it worked fine yesterday and
	ls -l says that it was last modified oct 30.
Repeat-By:
	on cogsci: /etc/ping eris  (note: eris isn't reachable 
	because CF&C's proteon net is down)

	a core dump of it as it was misbehaving in /usr/crash on
	cogsci.
