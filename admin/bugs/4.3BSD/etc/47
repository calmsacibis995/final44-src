Subject: timed may hog mbufs (with fix)
Index: etc/timed/timed.c 4.3BSD

Description:
    (This bug was originally reported by Mike Muss on Unix-Wizards.  His
     report is included below.)

    When timed is started with the "-M" flag (may be master) and is
    not running as master at the moment, it receives all ICMP packets
    sent to the host.  This can use a large number of mbuf if a ping is
    run for a long period of time.

    Mike's complaint:

	Did anybody knkw:that on 4.3 BSD, when timed is started with the -M
	flag, but it is not running as the master, that it holds open a
	socket listening for ICMP messages, yet it neglects to read them?

	On a system that uses PING for testing, etc, this can result in
	a great many MBUFs being nailed down and ignored (several hundred
	in this afternoon's debacle)?  This isn't enormously harmful, unless
	you are running low on MBUFs, but can be a surprising bit of behavior.

Repeat-By:
    I'm not positive this will work as a test, but should.  Find a machine
    with timed started using the "-M" flag and not being master.  Ping this
    machine and watch the number of mbufs in use increase using netstat.

Fix:
    I have not tested this fix as I do not have access to a 4.3 machine.
