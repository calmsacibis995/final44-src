Subject: Bug in ftpd when renaming a file
Index: etc/ftpd/ftpcmd.y  4.3BSD

Description:
	ftpd gets confused if the RNFR command fails.  If RNFR returns
	a negative response, then the next command generates a
	500 Unexpected command '<cmd>'.
	Then the connection is closed (421 Server closed connection;...)
	If after RNFR returns a negative response a RNTO command is issued
        a '503 command out of sequence' is returned and the connection is
        not closed (correct behavior).
	
Repeat-By:
	ftp to somewhere writable.
	issue the rename command for a file that isn't there.
