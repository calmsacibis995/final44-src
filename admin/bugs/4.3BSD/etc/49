Subject: rlogind cleanup() not protected from SIGCHLD interrupts
Index: etc/rlogind.c  4.3BSD

Description:
	rlogind sometimes updates utmp (erases the utmp record) without
	updating wtmp too.  This happens when he goes into cleanup(),
	erases the utmp record (rmut()), gets a SIGCHLD before erasing
	the wtmp record, jumps to cleanup() again, finds the utmp record
	doesn't exist and then forgets about the wtmp record.  Protecting
	cleanup() from SIGCHLD fixes the problem.

Repeat-By:
	Inspect the code.  This bug is timing dependent and difficult
	to produce except when you don't want it to happen.

Fix:
	add the following line to rlogind.c right before the call to cleanup():
	162a163
	> 	signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);

	The line numbers might now be quite in sync with the original source...
