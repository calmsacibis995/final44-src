Subject: edquota won't let you edit quotas on all filesystems
Index: 	etc/edquota.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Edquota will not let you edit quotas on a filesystem where
	the user has no files.
Repeat-By:
	Create a new account and edquota it.  You will note that
	some (if not all) file systems are missing.
Fix:
359c359,373

> 				break;
