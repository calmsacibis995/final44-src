Subject: Routes through a non-zero metric gateway don't reflect gateway cost
Index: 	etc/routed/output.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Routes through a gateway with a non-zero cost metric do not
	have this metric added to the routing cost.  We locally
	have two network segments connected by two gateways.  One is
	a fast link which should be used as long as it's available.
	The other is a slip line which should only be used if the
	primary gateway is down.  In order to reflect this, we give the
	slip line a non-trivial metric cost.  Unfortunately, both gateways
	issue equal cost routes to network segments on the other sides of
	themselves.  Although the route metric for the
	specific interface reflects the metric ifconfig'd into the
	route, any route packets sent do not reflect the cost of the
	interface for any other networks on the "other" side of
	the expensive gateway.  One then ends up with the interesting case of
	routes to networks on the other side of the gateway having
	a lower metric than that of the direct gateway host.
Repeat-By:
	Set up a gateway with a non-zero metric.  Examine the routes
	broadcast by both sides with query.
Fix:
	Kirk Smith and I debated whether the proper fix belongs in
	routing packet input or output.  Although input is probably
	more "morally" correct, the fix in output is a lot easier.
