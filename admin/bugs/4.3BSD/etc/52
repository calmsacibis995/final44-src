Subject: inetd doesn't reset internal struct when reading conf file +FIX
Sender: sunybcs!nobody@okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU
Index: etc/inetd.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When inetd.c reads in its configure file it does not reset the
	se_bi structure to NULL between entries.  As a result once you have
	a service that is internal in /etc/inetd.conf then all
	subsequent services will have this struct set to the most recently
	read internal service.
Repeat-By:
	Put services in /etc/inetd.conf after the internal ones and
	try to use them.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch.
