Subject: Errorneous error message from ifconfig
Index: etc/ifconfig.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	ifconfig errorneously reports "protocol not supported" when you
	invoke it without specifying a specific address family.  For example
	if you do "ifconfig dmc0" on a kernel without XNS support, ifconfig
	will first report stuff about the inet addresses but then say
	"ifconfig: socket: Protocol not supported" and then exit abnormally.

Repeat-By:
	Configure a kernel without XNS support and run ifconfig.

Fix:
	On line 365 of ifconfig vers 4.18, routine xns_status(), a call is
	made to socket() and if it returns an error, errno is tested against
	EAFNOSUPPORT and if true the procedure returns without an error message.
	The kernel, however, returns EPROTONOSUPPORT in such circumstances and
	hence the test on errno fails.  The errno test needs to be made against
	what the kernel returns.
