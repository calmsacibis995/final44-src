Index: etc/ftpd 4.3BSD

I hope I got the right mailing list.
I have not heard anyone mention this yet, but '/etc/ftpd'
has some problems. The problems appear with several commands, but
the easiest way to reproduce the sequence is to:

	ftp>rename xxx yyy (where xxx is non-existent)

After this fails, your next command is 'misunderstood' and the
server will close the connection on any command following. If the
server does not close the connection, you nevertheless will see
very strange responses to subsequent commands.
It seems 'mdelete' causes similar behavior, as well as 'ls' with
bogus arguments. The server's behavior is identical on all of the
4.3BSD systems I have tried.
NOTE: if you try it like this:
	ftp> quote rnfr xxx 
	ftp> quote rnto yyy
This sequence produces errors, but the server doesn't lose its mind
on subsequent commands. 
I have not been( and will not be) able to spend any time on this, but
my best guestimate is that the file "ftpcmd.y" has some bad table
setups and/or is failing to properly reset itself after commands with
bad arguments.

It also appears that the 4.3 ftp user has problems with the 'reset' command
after one of these nonsensical sequences. You get:
reset: Bad file number
An infinite number of times on your screen.

I hope this is news, if not, excuse the redundancy.

Subject: error report 4.3BSD/etc/58 (ftpd and ftp)

The ftpd and ftp source directories on okeeffe now contain the following
fixes:

/ftpd/ftpd.c: stderr is freopenned to /dev/null to prevent "file not found"
	error messages from going back over the control connection when ls()
	is executed, violating the protocol and putting the command/reply
	pattern out of sequence.

/ftpd/ftpcmd.y: the yacc grammer to handle rename command (RNFR and RNTO) is
	changed to handle error situations correctly (RNFR file not found).

/ftp/ftp.c: the reset command no longer loops if issued after the previous
	command resulted in loss of the control connection.
