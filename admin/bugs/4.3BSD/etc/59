Subject: routed daemon deletes point-to-point routes

Description:
	The /etc/routed daemon deletes point-to-point routes after
	about a minute and a half.  The problem is that someone added
	what looks like an efficiency fix, and broke the supplier
	function of the route daemon completely, even for networks
	that aren't point-to-point.  The only reason routed works at
	all, and doesn't delete non-point-to-point routes, is because
	routed sees its own REQUEST broadcasts on such a network, and
	issues a RESPOND packet, which it also sees.  On point-to-point
	networks, routed doesn't talk to itself in this manner, and
	therefore fails to get such routes updated, and eventually
	deletes them.

Repeat-By:
	Run /etc/routed on both sides of a point-to-point network, and
	watch the route get deleted after about a minute and a half.

Fix:
	I don't have time to figure out and fix the basic problem, but
	here is a context diff to remove the efficiency fix that is
	causing the problem.
