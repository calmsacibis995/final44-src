Subject: comsat incorrectly intuits need for carriage return
Index: 	etc/comsat.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Comsat tries to figure out if the lines printed out to the
	screen should be ended with NL or CR-NL.  It checks if the
	terminal has CRMOD bit set.  If so, it used NL, else it uses
	CR-NL.  However, in raw mode the CRMOD bit is ignored.
Repeat-By:
	% biff y
	% script
	% Mail -s test $USER < /etc/motd

	In a few seconds /etc/motd will appear in utter disarray
	on your screen.
Fix:
187c187
< 	cr = (gttybuf.sg_flags & CRMOD) ? "" : "\r";
---
> 	cr = (gttybuf.sg_flags&CRMOD) && !(gttybuf.sg_flags&RAW) ? "" : "\r";
