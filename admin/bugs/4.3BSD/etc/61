Subject: Gee Dad, these puppies followed me home.  Can I keep 'em, huh?
Index: etc 4.3BSD

No you can't!  These are dogs, not puppies:

	etc/arff.c(731): warning: constant (in conditional context)
		if (type = 'r')
	usr.bin/ypwhich.c(564): warning: constant (in conditional context)
			if (err = YPERR_NOMORE) {

So:  it looks like the "if (whatever = CONSTANT)" code catches what it's
supposed to without producing any bogus messages.
