Subject:  Bug in telnetd.c CR processing in binary mode
Index: etc/telnetd 4.3BSD +FIX

Description:
	When in binary output mode, telnetd continues to add a NULL
	to CR's that lack a trailing NL.
Repeat-By:
	Connect to 4.3BSD from a TAC.  Put it in binary output
	mode (@b o s) and cat a binary file that contains CR's that
	do not have a trailing NL (e.g. a file of CRs).  NULLs will
	follow the CRs.

Fix:
	I believe that this should be fixed by adding a test for
	binary mode around the CR/NL CR/NULL processing, and making
	sure that we have enough characters in the queue before
	trying to do CR processing (pcc > 1).

	This fix is untested and for comment.

			if (c == IAC)
				*nfrontp++ = c;
			*nfrontp++ = c;
!!!!!			if ((myopts[TELOPT_BINARY] == OPT_NO)
!!!!!			    && c == '\r' && pcc > 1) {
!!!!!				if ((*ptyip & 0377) == '\n') {
					*nfrontp++ = *ptyip++ & 0377;
					pcc--;
				} else
