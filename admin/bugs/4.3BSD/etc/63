Subject: ftpd remotehelp output columnated improperly
Index: etc/ftpd/ftpcmd.y 4.3BSD

Description:
	Lines output in response to the "remotehelp" command are longer
	than expected, introducing extra blank lines.
Repeat-By:
	Issue the "remotehelp" command to a 4.3BSD ftpd server.
Fix:
	The "unimplemented" character is not being counted in the help()
	function in ftpcmd.y.  Here is rcsdiff output to fix the problem:
	("<" = old ftpcmd.y; ">" = corrected ftpcmd.y)

< 		int len = strlen(c->name);
---
> 		int len = strlen(c->name) + 1;
837,838d836
< 		if (c->implemented == 0)
< 			len++;

< 				w = strlen(c->name);
---
> 				w = strlen(c->name) + 1;
