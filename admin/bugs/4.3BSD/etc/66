Subject: syslogd should support LOG_UUCP but doesn't
Index: etc/syslogd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	There is a reference to LOG_UUCP in /usr/include/sys/syslog.h
	but not support for it in syslogd.c or logger.c
	(in the tahoe beta distribution)

Repeat-By:
	Try adding a uucp entry to your syslogd.conf and using it.

Fix:
------- syslogd.c -------
917a918
> 	"uucp",		LOG_UUCP,

------- logger.c -------
152a153
> 	"uucp",		LOG_UUCP,
