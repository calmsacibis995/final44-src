Subject: telnetd problem
Index: etc/telnetd.c 4.3BSD

the 4.3 telnet daemon adds a null after \r. this causes problems for terminals
that address the cursor using binary addresses (one such stupid thing is
the tandberg tdv2200 series). This 'feature should probably be removed,
at least in binary mode.
