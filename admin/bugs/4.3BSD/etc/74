Subject: FTP daemon has a rename bug


Index: etc/ftpd/ftpcmd.y 4.3BSD

Description:

If a rename command is given to the FTP daemon with an invalid first
file name, the parser gets confused and refuses to accept any more commands.

Repeat-By:

Try a rename command with a bogus file name:

	. . .
230 User nowicki logged in.
ftp> rename foo bar
---> RNFR foo
550 foo: No such file or directory.
ftp> binary
---> TYPE I
500 'TYPE I': command not understood.
ftp> dir
---> PORT 192,9,90,58,4,243
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection

Fix:

Just add the case of a rename_from (RNFR) command by itself to the YACC
grammar:

***************
*** 254,259 ****
--- 254,260 ----
                                free((char *) $4);
                }
        |       rename_cmd
+       |       rename_from
        |       HELP CRLF
                = {
                        help((char *) 0);
