Subject: syslogd to remote machines
Index: 	etc/syslogd 4.3BSD

Description:
	Syslogd doesn't log to remote machines correctly...
Repeat-By:
	Syslog to a remote machine...
Fix:
	Simple:
	There is a place in logmsg (ub tge F_FORW case) that uses a pointer
	into the iov array instead of the iov array...
	Here's a diff of the most current source:
534,535c534,535
< 			(void) sprintf(line, "<%d>%.15s %s", pri, v[0].iov_base,
< 				v[4].iov_base);
---
> 			(void) sprintf(line, "<%d>%.15s %s", pri,
> 				iov[0].iov_base, iov[4].iov_base);
