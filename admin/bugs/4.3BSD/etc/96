Subject: config(8) dumps core on certain input
Index: etc/config/config.y 4.3BSD

Description:
	config(8) attempts to chain down an uninitialized link list pointer
	under certain conditions:
Repeat-By:
	Using the following has caused the problem in our system:

	controller	mba1	at nexus ?
	master		 ht0	at mba1 drive ?
	master		 ht1	at mba1 drive ?
	tape		  tu0	at ht? slave ?
	tape		  tu1	at ht? slave ?

Fix:
	The following patch forces newdev() to return properly-initialized
	next pointers.  The problem is caused by a call to newdev() out of
	huhcon() where d_next is never explicitly initialized.
