Subject: snake makefile versus SysV-style make
Index: games/snake/Makefile 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	If you use a System V style make that imports environment
	variables, `make install' installs snake setuid whoever ran
	the install, since it uses ${USER} as an internal macro.

	(I know:  `Why would you do that?')

Repeat-by:
	I use a one line C-shell script called `make' so that I
	can `setenv CFLAGS ...':

		#! /bin/csh -f
		exec /bin/make $*:q "`printenv`"

	or you could hack make itself (ick).

Fix:
	I also removed the `-o ${USER}'s from the installs that do
	not set any special modes.  These seem likely to be left over
	from when someone first wrote snake and had it setuid himself....
