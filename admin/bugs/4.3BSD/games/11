Subject: infinite loop in mille
Index: games 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	Sometimes mille gets in an infinite loop, typing ^G, just when
	you're about to score 3000 points on a terrific hand.
Repeat-By:
	This happens when there are no more cards in the deck and
	it's the computer's turn to move.  If you always ask for the
	extension, even when it's bad strategy, you'll soon run into
	this situation.
Fix:
	In comp.c, change lines 354-383 to the following.  The change is
	that in four places I've replaced
		Movetype == M_DRAW
	with
		Movetype == M_DRAW || Topcard <= Deck
	(Note: I don't really see why the if (...) is necessary at all,
	in the non-debug version, but then, I don't understand the complete
	structure of the program.  My fix works, though.)  Here's the code:

play_it:
		mvaddstr(MOVE_Y + 1, MOVE_X, "PLAY\n");
#ifdef DEBUG
		if (Debug)
			getmove();
		if (!Debug || Movetype == M_DRAW || Topcard <= Deck) {
#else
		if (Movetype == M_DRAW || Topcard <= Deck) {
#endif
			Movetype = M_PLAY;
			Card_no = nummax;
		}
	}
	else {
		if (issafety(pp->hand[nummin])) { /* NEVER discard a safety */
			nummax = nummin;
			goto play_it;
		}
		mvaddstr(MOVE_Y + 1, MOVE_X, "DISCARD\n");
#ifdef DEBUG
		if (Debug)
			getmove();
		if (!Debug || Movetype == M_DRAW || Topcard <= Deck) {
#else
		if (Movetype == M_DRAW || Topcard <= Deck) {
#endif
			Movetype = M_DISCARD;
			Card_no = nummin;
		}
	}
