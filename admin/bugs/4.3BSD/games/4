Subject: number.c doesn't understand end of file
Index: games/number.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Number doesn't exit on EOF.
Repeat-By:
	"echo 2 | number" produces the appropriate output and then
	hangs waiting for more input.
Fix:
	Apparently number.c didn't get caught in the sweep for stdio
	programs when stdio appeared with V7; it still thinks that
	getchar() will return 0 on EOF. Fix with the following diffs:
