Subject: The game trek keeps giving me segmentation faults

Index: games 4.3BSD

Description:
   I like to play trek.  I enter it via /usr/games/trek.
   At random times, but especially when crossing sectors in the galaxy,
the program bombs and I'm booted out to unix command level with the error
message that I got a segmentation fault.

Repeat-By:
   Just play trek long enough until the error arises.
