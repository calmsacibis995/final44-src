Subject: fortune makefile fails as distributed
Index: games/fortune/Makefile 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Since /usr/src is distributed read-only, when `make'
	copies scene to fortunes, it leaves it read-only, which
	makes the next two commands fail.

Repeat-by:
	Run `make' in /usr/src/games/fortune straight off a
	distribution tape.

Fix:
	If there were a file with "%-" in it this would be even
	better . . . .
