Subject: backgammon makefile always writes message.c

Index: games/backgammon/Makefile 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	As distributed, `message.c' is not writable, which makes
	ex squawk while making backgammon.  This does not harm
	anything, but is annoying.

Repeat-by:
	cd /nbsd/usr/src/games/backgammon; make

Fix:
	Below.  Incidentally, ucb/Mail and games/monop are
	distributed with unwritable `strings' files too.
	Perhaps the `make clean' entries for these should
	remove the files, rather than truncate them.
