Subject: Make and load ques.
Index: 	ideas 4.3BSD

Description:
        This is not a bug.  It is a suggestion.  I've come to like working
        with the make program.  One problem I have is that when the system
        is bogged down and all compiles go into a que I have to wait for
        the entire que for each compile.  My suggestion is to make the make
        program smarter so that it figures out all of the operations that
        it has to do before executing any of them.  It could then load all
        of the compiles into the que one after the other.  This way the
        user would only have to wait once per make instead of 3 or 4 or more
        times.

        Not applicable.
Fix:
        See above.
