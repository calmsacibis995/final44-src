Subject: syslogd thought
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

It might be nice to be able to say things like

	"program".debug		/tmp/debug.prog

to make syslog log all DEBUG priority messages that have the
string "program" as the source.  One could then compile debug
options into lots of programs, but no matter how many programs
were being debugged, get only the interesting messages logged.
