Subject: Calendar program
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

I use a calendar file in my home directory and have an idea for how this
program might be extended to make it more useful.  Currently, the program is
executed automatically by cron to remind users of upcoming events by looking
for lines in their individual calendar files, which match "tomorrow's" date.

However, this only permits calendar to remind me of things which need 1 day's
notice.  There are a whole bunch of activities that need more notice than that.
Currently, to remind myself of these events, I must modify the dates in all
those lines.  For example, say I have to mail a birthday card to somebody.
Calendar will only tell me about it one day in advance.  I could change the
date to get calendar to remind me of the event earlier, but then I would lose
the birthday or have to record both a reminder date and the birthday.

It would be nice if calendar would look for some markers in individual
calendar files to tell it how many days advance notice I need for a given event.
Something like all lines following a line containing:
#	+2
will get two day's notice, might be a nice feature to have.  The prospect of
changing 40 birthdays to get the program to do what I want is not appealing,
although that's what I've had to do.

Good to get all that off my chest.  And thanks for an otherwise very useful
program.
