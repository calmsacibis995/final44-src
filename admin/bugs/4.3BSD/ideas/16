Subject: talk
Index: ideas/talk 4.3BSD

Though the split-window format of "talk" is much more user-friendly
than the old "write", the way things start is still barbaric, with  a
"message from talk daemon" splatted in the middle of whatever
you're doing, and the problem of memorizing the sender's name to reply
(especially difficult if you've automatically redrawn the screen
in response to the mess!).  I suggest that the talkdaemon use
termcap to figure out how to jump to the top of the screen, draw a box
there, and put its message in that; and that there be an option talk -r
which would talk to whoever just tried to contact one, instead of the
user trying to copy "user@host.subdomain.domain.xxx"!  On something like
a SUN, it would be desirable if the message appeared and the whole
communication took place in an entirely new window.  Still another
problem arises when the recipient is rlogged-in from one machine to
another, and doesn't know which machine to reply from.  I leave to you
to think of an elegant way to handle that.
