Subject: Enhancement to window - WINDOW_NUM environment variable
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

There are a few important applications being run here that require
at least 24x80 windows. While the real problem is in having such
applications, there was little choice.

The easiest thing for people to do was to move the top border of the
window so that it was above the physical screen, but that loses
the window number.

Therefore, I changed window to set the environment variable
WINDOW_NUM to the window id number. This allows users to place
the window number in the prompt or set up a command to display
the current window number.

The change is reflected in the following patch. This patch
depends on the 4.3BSD setenv() subroutine (one of the official
4.3BSD fixes posted to comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes). If you don't
have this routine, get it or write your own.
