Subject: There should be a program to send short messages, not mail.
Index: 	ideas 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe.berkeley.edu

Description:
	There should be a program to send brief messages directly to a user
	or to a user on another machine.  When you want to thank somebody,
	or to send a note that doesn't require a response, the program would
	be very handy.  On the other end, it is annoying to discover that
	you have new mail (say, through biff) and stop what you're doing,
	get into mail, and read the letter to find that it's just "Great,
	thanks."  Suggested syntax is "send user" or "send user@host" or
	"send user{@host} tty" if the person is logged in on more than one
	terminal.
Repeat-By:
	Send a thank you letter sometime to a very busy person and watch the
	flames scorch you.
