Subject: How do I go about . . .

Index: ideas 4.3BSD
sending software to you guys at Berkeley?

The latest 4.2BSD releases apparently come with the ``ndbm'' library,
which is being used to speed up access to /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts.
Well, as you may have heard, I've recently rewritten the dbm code to
allow multiple keys on a particular datum.  This should be of some use
in these particular cases, since the passwd file needs to be indexed
not only by user ID but by user NAME as well.  In the case of the host
table, there are usually several names for one ID number.

In each case the multiple key aspect of ``mdbm'' will probably help to
save valuable disk space on the / partition.  So I would like to find
out how to go about sending you my wonderful new package :-) (sorry,
I just can't resist).

Suggestions?  Comments?  Pointers?  Threats?

Chris
