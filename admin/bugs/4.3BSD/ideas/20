Subject: Suggestion re queued mail (sendmail)
Index: ideas 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	There needs to be a way to "take back" queued mail.  Right now
	when I say "mailq" I see a message that I sent earlier this
	evening to a list of several people.  It got to all but one of
	them.  Now, it happens that I know an alternate route to reach
	that person, so I could re-route the mail, except I can't get
	to it because I didn't keep a copy, and anyway I don't want him
	to get it twice, and eventually the original version will get
	through.  I would like to be able to say
		unmail AA27049 [somefile]
	and that should (1) check that I am the message author; (2) copy
	both the qf and df files (qf to remind me who didn't get the
	message) into somefile (default ~/dead.letter, maybe); (3) remove
	the queue entry.
