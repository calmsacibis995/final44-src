Subject: -B option for "col" to help with "script" cleanup
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

What I want to be able to do is filter the output of "script"ed sessions so
that they can be included in bug reports.  A simple
	col -b < typescript > sentscript
does most of the job.  The only problem comes if, as I type something in, I
need to backspace to correct an error.  If I backspace and then put a space
where a letter used to be, "col" still produces the letter in its output.

Here's the code for a "-B" option to col that treats ' ' as if it were a
printing character (and automatically turns on -b).

And here's to easier to produce and read bug reports.
