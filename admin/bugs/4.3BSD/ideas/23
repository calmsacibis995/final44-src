Subject: Utilities that create directory structures
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

I've noticed that Unix utilities that create directory structures, cp
and rcp -r for example, although I think that tar (when restoring with
the original permissions) and other programs have the same problem,
act as if they create the directory with the source's protection and
then create files in it.  The problem with this is that this directory
protection may not allow file creation.  (Why would one do this?
Well, it allows you to keep a directory full of read-only files and
back it up to other machines.)  This may be an ultrix-only problem, or
may even be Stanford-specific, but I doubt it.

The "obvious" right thing to do is for these programs to create the
directory with some protection that lets them create the necessary
files, do so, and then set the appropriate protection afterwards.

Why am I sending this to you?  Well, if Sun gets this right, then
other vendors are likely to.  We don't run a lot of sun software here,
so I don't have a legit channel and this isn't the sort of request
that fits an SPR anyway.
