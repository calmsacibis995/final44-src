Subject: comments for 4.4BSD
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

I have a few comments I hope you will consider in 4.4BSD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw a proposal several months ago about the new file system layout
that I think was a big step in the right direction.  It began
separating the functionality of files that have ended up jumbled
together in etc and lib directories.  Currently, "etc" and "lib" do not
have very clear meanings.  The proposal I saw had several
subdirectories under /usr/lib that each had a purpose.  My main
objection to that is that the name "lib" is still heavily overloaded.  I
propose that the new directory layout look something like this:

	lib		compiler library archives (only)
	system/bin	programs used only by system admistators
				(e.g. mount, halt, shutdown)
	aux		programs and interpreted scripts used by other programs
	cnf		configuration files e.g. sendmail.cf
	data		data files read & written by programs (e.g. sendmail.fc)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For our locally developed products, we have adopted a
standardized usage for system CPP macros.  The details aren't important
here, but I'd like to mention that we like what 4.3BSD has done (unlike
Ultrix and Sunos) in not having many cpp macros auto-defined by cpp.
Identifiers auto-defined by cpp are effectively keywords to user's
programs.  We also like the notation BSD=43 because it allows us to do
the following:

	#if defined(BSD) && BSD >= 43

I hope you'll retain these ideas in 4.4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's something I would like to be able to do with syslogd that 4.3BSD syslogd
will not do.  I would like to direct messages to different log files based on whether
or not they were logged on the local host.  For example, say I want each host to
keep a log of its own kernel messages, but I also want to collect kernel messages from
all hosts in a common place.

Example:

	master host
	-----------
	kern.info						/usr/adm/messages
	kern.info						/usr/adm/all_kernel.log
	...

	remote host
	----------
	kern.info						/usr/adm/messages
	kern.info						@masterhost
	...

Currently, there is no way to prevent remote host's kernel messages from going into the
master's private kernel messages file.  I'd like something in the configuration file
to turn off network-orgined logs to certain log files.
