Subject: please make rsh use the standard shell under some option (-c/-s)
Date: Tue, 18 Apr 89 20:26:48 -0500
Index: ideas 4.3BSD


I'd like to be able to tell rsh(1) to use a real shell rather than
a random shell.  I'd add options al-la at(1) to select which shell to
use (the default being the remote users shell).
