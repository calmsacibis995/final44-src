Subject: suggestion for sendbug
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

You should make it grep out the `subject' line, and if
it still says `short summary of the problem', refuse to
send the bug (dumping people back in the editor):

	sendbug
		...
	sendbug: you have not included a subject!
	What now? [send, edit, abort] 

(the latter is supposed to imply doing what rn/pnews do).
