Subject: vi enhancement request
Index: ideas 4.3BSD

	I use the autowrite option for vi.  This means that when I get a
"editor buffer saved" message after a system crash, I frequently find that the
saved buffer is more out of date than the file itself.  (At least I assume
that the two statements are connected).  In any case, this is a pain, as it
requires that I diff the two files and figure out which I want.

	What I would like is for a write to cause the files that the preserve
process looks at (I don't actually understand how this all happens) to reflect
the fact that the file is now entirely up to date, and no buffer should be
saved for later recovery.

	Thanks.
