Subject: The dreaded 'r' versus 'R' in /usr/ucb/mail
Index: ideas 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	Like everyone else in the world, I keep getting unwanted
	junk mail because someone who doesn't know any better
	says 'r' instead of 'R' when replying to a message sent
	to a mailing list.

	I know that an attempt was made to fix this problem by
	allowing interchanging 'r' and 'R' through one's .mailrc,
	but this doesn't help, since the problem is not that *I*
	type the wrong thing, it's that *other people* type the
	wrong thing.  The Sun decision to reverse the default
	just makes things more complicated, so people who use both
	Sun and non-Sun machines never know what to type.
Fix:
	I suggest that the mail program be changed so that, by
	default, BOTH 'r' AND 'R' do the right thing, i.e., reply
	only to the originator of the message.

	The command 'replyall' (with no abbreviation allowed) could
	continue to do the wrong thing.  Also, it would be okay with
	me if it were possible to set a variable in .mailrc that would
	interpret 'R' (or even 'r') to mean replyall.  But the default
	should be that a user can't send out mass junk mail with any
	one-letter command.

	I know this isn't the most exciting new computer science project
	in the world, but with all the time we save not having to read
	and delete messages saying "Yes, I think that's a good idea" and
	the like, we can catch up with the Japanese.
