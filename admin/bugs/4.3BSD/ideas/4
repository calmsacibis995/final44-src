Subject: sending eof to pty's

Index: ideas 4.3BSD

	Emacs and gnumacs users often fire up various processes within buffers,
so that we may use the editing features of emacs on commands transmitted to
the processes; the convenience of this, is I think, obvious.

	However, there is one annoyance which makes our lives needlessly
difficult; it appears impossible to send an end-of-file character from the
buffer to the running process.  I've asked the various emacs gurus around
why this is, and they claim that this occurs because it's impossible to send
an end-of-file character to a pty under 4.2 BSD.   Now, I don't really
understand this, since it is certainly possible to send eof to a remote login.
Can anyone out there shed any light on this matter, or tell me what 
"improvement" has been made to 4.2 that makes sending eof to a process running
in an emacs buffer impossible?  Apparently it was possible under 4.1.

					Thanks,
					   Rick.
