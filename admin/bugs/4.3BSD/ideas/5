Subject: enhance 'record' in Mail

Index: ideas 4.3BSD

After printing and filing many inches of mail folders and my 'record'
file, I find that the questions and the answers are separated by
great distances, and that the 'record' file is not broken into pages
so I can physically shuffle them.
My suggestion is to enhance the 'record' notion to append the reply
to the current folder file, rather than a single separate file.
In this way both halves of a dialogue are filed in the same place.
Or the record directive could be left and a separate command created
to enable this feature.
Thanks for your ear, Bob Tidd	2-6418
