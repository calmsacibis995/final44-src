Perhaps this has already been done on 4.2bsd; we're runninng 4.1bsd on a VAX.

One problem that fsck misses is when a directory has been corrupted so that
a slash character appears in a filename.  This is a definite no-no, since
you won't be able to open or stat or do *anything* with such a file.  It
would be nice if fsck noticed such files; corrective action might be to
replace slashes in filenames with some other character.

It might also be reasonable to extend the above check so that characters with
the high-order bit set are found--although such characters are "legal",
they're never used on any systems I've dealt with, so their presence indicates
an error.
