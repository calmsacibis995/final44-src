It would be nice if the user of "ruptime" or "rwho" could specify
the network with respect to which s/he wants the information,
e.g. "ucbspine", "ucbether" etc., without having to be logged in on
a machine on that network.  So, for instance, if I give an rsh
command to a machine on a different network from my local machine's,
and get "connection timed out", I could have a way of telling whether
it or a gateway machine is down, and if it is not the gateway, I could
tell how long it had been down.  (You systems people doubtless have
accounts on enough machines so that you can get that information
one way or another, but ordinary users don't.)

It would also be useful if more information could be provided about
machines that were down; e.g. if a system manager taking a machine
down could send a message to some other machine that would
cause the ruptime entry for the machine being taken down to include
"[PM 10:00-13:00]" or "[monthly backups 6:00-12:00]" or whatever.

Finally, it would be good if there were a way to send a command
to one's account on a machine that was down, to be executed
when it came up.  I guess berknet allows this, but not any of
the rsh-related commands that I know.
