I think it would be very helpful if the msgs program printed the `Date:'
and `From:' lines, instead of the `From' line, for the following reasons.

1. `Date:' is the most important, since most msgs are time dependent,
and some require replies within a reasonable amount of time.

2. `From:' includes the name of the person, which is also very helpful info.

3. The ID in the `From' line is included in the `From:' line, while
the date in the `From' line is irrelevant, except for a systems
analyst.  This makes the `From' line irrelevant to the user reading the msg.

The msgs program could be changed, or else made to configure itself
according to the user's .msgsrc file.  The latter is an unnecessary
complication, I think.

Following the recent discussion of the use of msgs, the msg program could
have a flag that causes the default response be no (n), rather than yes (y).
A person could then invoke msgs with the flag that allows most of their
responses to be default -- requiring just a carriage return.

I think we would all be pleased to have the msgs program upgraded to
eliminate the unnecessary resending of msgs.  This could easily be done
by having the local msgs program *always* send an acknowledgement,
along with explicit instructions as to what the user should or should
not do for negative conditions.  Remote machines often complain, but
without making it clear what the user should do, if anything.
