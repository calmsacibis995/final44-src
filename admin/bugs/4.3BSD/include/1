Subject: Include file incompatible with lint 
Index: include/sys/ioctl.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	Lint complains that the ioctl "request" (argument 2 - from the
	ioctl.h include file) is not an int.
Repeat-By:
	run lint on any code that includes an ioctl call with a plain
	ioctl.h request symbol as  the 2nd argument.
Fix:
	Perhaps, include explicit cast the symbol definitions.
	(I would guess lint thinks it is a long right now)
