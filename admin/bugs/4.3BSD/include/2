Subject: ioctl.h lies
Index: include/sys/ioctl.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	the comments next to FIOCLEX and FIONCLEX say "exclusive use";
	WRONG: they're CLose on EXec and No CLose on EXec.
Repeat-By:
	Code inspection of ioctl() in sys/sys_generic.c, and execve()
	in kern_exec.c
Fix:
	Change the comments in ioctl.h with your favorite editor.
