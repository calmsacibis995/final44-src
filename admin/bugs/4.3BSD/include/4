Subject: Rwho reports only 41 users (Bug or Feature?)
Index: include/protocols/rwhod.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	Rwho and ruptime's report structure is limited to 1024 bytes;
	this causes them to report only 41 users even if more are active.
Repeat-By:
	Do 'ruptime' on a system where more than 41 users are logged in.
Fix:
	The size of 1024 is hard-coded, not even #defined, so I guess
	it should be ok to change it and recompile - but this must be
	done on *all* systems; can this cause trouble with the network?

	Alternatively, change rwho to at least hint that there may be more
	users than reported.
