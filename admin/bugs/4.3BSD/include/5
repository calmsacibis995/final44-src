Subject: <stdarg.h>
Index: 	include 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Though I realize that <stdarg.h> is an ANSI, rather than a UNIX,
	include file, it would help the portablilty of my programs
	considerably if you could put a copy of it in the system
	include directory (as well as varargs.h, they're not incompatable).

Repeat-By:
	N.A.
Fix:
	Put a file called stdarg.h in the default include directory. It
	should contain the following four lines:

	typedef char *va_list;
	#define va_start(argp,vector) argp = (va_list)&vector + sizeof(vector)
	#define va_arg(argp,type)     ((type *)(argp += sizeof(type)))[-1]
	#define va_end(argp)          argp = NULL
