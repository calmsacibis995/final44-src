Subject: disk label `gettype' routine should use strcasecmp

Index: lib/libc/gen/disklabel.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The disk label library code defines a `ustrcmp' function
	that does the same thing as strcasecmp.  gettype should
	just call strcasecmp instead.

Repeat-by:
	examination

Fix:
	I think I just said that.
