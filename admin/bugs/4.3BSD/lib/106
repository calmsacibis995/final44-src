Subject: MCRT0 exit() doesn't use _exit()
Index: lib/libc/csu/crt0.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The profiling version of exit() does the exit system call
	directly rather than calling _exit().  Given the lack of an
	on_exit()-style facility, this prevents programmers from
	regaining control, when profiling is used, by defining their
	own _exit().
Repeat-By:
	Write a program that redefines _exit(), compile it for
	profiling, and note that _exit() is never called.
Fix:
	Apply the following patch.  This also does away with two more
	asm()'s and the dependency on r11!
