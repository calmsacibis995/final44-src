Subject: C compiler doesn't generate proper code
Index: lib/pcc 4.3BSD

Description:
	The code (*px)++ does not generate the right machine instructions
	if px is type double *. --(*px) works just fine.

Repeat-By:
	main()
	{
		double *px, x;

		x = 0.0;
		px = &x;
		(*px)++;
		printf("%f\n", x);
	}

	cc -S will show the instructions to do most of the work are
	generated correctly, it's just that the result of the ++ is
	never saved away.

Fix:
	Beats me.

Is this a bug report for the vax compiler or the tahoe compiler?  The
current (i.e. as of last month) vax compiler seems to handle this
correctly.  The current tahoe compiler screws up...  I made another
small change to pcc.tahoe/local2.c and it seems to work now, but I
haven't installed the new compiler binary yet.  (I tried to copy the
changed local2.c out to the compiler alpha test directory on /nbsd, but
the filesystem was write protected -- does this mean the tape is
finally getting cut?  If so, this fix constitutes patch #1; I'll whip
out a bug report and patch file.)

How exciting,

Donn
