Subject: Problem with printf float and 0.01
Index: lib/libc/stdio/?printf.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When printf is used with a float with the value of 0.01, it prints 
	the number as 0. I was wondering if a fix for this had been developed?
Repeat-By:
	#include <stdio.h>
	main()
	{
	     float blah;
	     float blah2;
	     float blah3;
	     char blow[80];
	     
	     blah = blah2 = blah3 = 0.002;
	     printf ("This is blah: %f\n", blah);
	     printf ("This is blah2: %g\n", blah2);
	     printf ("This is blah3: %f\n", blah3);
	     blah = blah2 = blah3 = 0.001;
	     printf ("This is blah: %f\n", blah);
	     printf ("This is blah2: %g\n", blah2);
	     printf ("This is blah3: %f\n", blah3);
	     blah = blah2 = blah3 = 0.01;
	     printf ("This is blah: %f\n", blah);
	     printf ("This is blah2: %g\n", blah2);
	     printf ("This is blah3: %f\n", blah3);
	     blah = blah2 = blah3 = 0.01;
	     fprintf (stdout,"This is blah: %f\n", blah);
	     fprintf (stdout,"This is blah2: %g\n", blah2);
	     fprintf (stdout,"This is blah3: %f\n", blah3);
	     blah = blah2 = blah3 = 0.01;
	     sprintf (blow,"This is blah: %f\n", blah);
	     printf (blow);
	     sprintf (blow,"This is blah2: %g\n", blah2);
	     printf (blow);
	     sprintf (blow,"This is blah3: %f\n", blah3);
	     printf (blow);
	}     
	>>a.out
	This is blah: 0.002000
	This is blah2: 0.002
	This is blah3: 0.002000
	This is blah: 0.001000
	This is blah2: 0.001
	This is blah3: 0.001000
	This is blah: 0.000000
	This is blah2: 0
	This is blah3: 0.000000
	This is blah: 0.000000
	This is blah2: 0
	This is blah3: 0.000000
	This is blah: 0.000000
	This is blah2: 0
	This is blah3: 0.000000
