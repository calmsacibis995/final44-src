Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) rup & rusers dump core if you're in many groups
#Index: lib/libc/rpc/pmap_rmt.c MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: lib/libc/rpc/pmap_rmt.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The rup and rusers commands dump core if you're in more than 8 groups.

Repeat-By:
	Creating a user who's in more than eight groups, logging in as that
	user, and typing either
		rup
	or
		rusers

Hand-Waving:
	The problem comes about because the function clnt_broadcast
	in "lib/libc/rpc/pmap_rmt.c" does a

		AUTH *unix_auth = authunix_create_default();

	call and, later, a

		AUTH_DESTROY(unix_auth);

	call--but fails to check authunix_create_default's return value to
	see if it's NULL.  When the NULL unix_auth is passed to AUTH_DESTROY,
	the core dump occurs.

	Why is unix_auth NULL?  Looking at authunix_create_default in
	"lib/libc/rpc/auth_unix.c" we see:

		AUTH *
		authunix_create_default()
		{
			register int len;
		...
			gid_t gids[NGRPS];

		...
			if ((len = getgroups(NGRPS, gids)) < 0)
				return (NULL);
		...
		}

	and if we "grep NGRPS auth_unix.h" we find:
		#define NGRPS 8
	as opposed to the
		#define	NGROUPS	16		/* max number groups */
	we find in "/usr/include/sys/params.h"

	The easy way out is to drop NGROUPS to 8.
	The hard way out is to recode "clnt_broadcast" and its callers.
