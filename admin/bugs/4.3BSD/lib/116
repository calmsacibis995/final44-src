Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 "nroff -me" may split "\*-" (with fix?)
Index: lib/tmac/tmac.e 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MORE/bsd 4.3 "nroff -me" command may put the two '-' characters
	that make up a "\*-" on different lines.

Repeat-By:
	Put the following line. . .
Now is the time for all good persons to come to the aid of\*-their party.
	. . .into a file named "fails" then run the command
		nroff -me fails | head
	and note the output (indented here for display purposes):
		Now is the time for all good persons to come to the aid  of-
		-their party.

	The same thing happens if you use a
		nroff -ms fails | head
	command.  And, if the word "persons" is changed to "constituents",
	the same thing happens if you use a
		nroff -mtxinu fails | head
	command.

Fix:
	This fixes the above problem(s), though it may introduce others:
	in the file "/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.e", change the line reading

		.ds - --

	to read

		.ds - \--

	Make the same change to "/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.txinu".
	And change the line in "/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.s" that reads

		.if n .ds - \%--

	to read

		.if n .ds - \--
