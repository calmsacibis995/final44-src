DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
   I just received a note saying that SPR 86100168, the return value 
   fputs(), which I reported as missing, has been fixed. Unfortunately,
   I did not report this error, but it is nice to hear about it.
   
   The description of the man page fix concerns me. According to X3J11
   86-009, the ANSI C draft standard, fputs() returns non-zero if an error
   occurs, otherwise it returns zero. It should not return the last character
   put. Putc() and putchar() both return the character written, or EOF on any
   error. Putchar(c) is defined to be equivalent to putc(c,stdout).
   
   The manual page should not be any more specific about the value returned
   by fputs(); the vagueness deliberately gives us the opportunity to
   optimize.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
   Follow the ANSI C standard when the Berkeley definition is vague;
   follow Berkeley when the two conflict.
