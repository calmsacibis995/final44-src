DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	ccom's table.c file should be compiled with the -R parameter.
	This puts the tables into text space, and allows them to be
	shared among all users of ccom.  The tables in as (optable.c?)
	should also be compiled with -R.

	This will reduce the system's memory requirement by about a
	page for each simultaneous copy of ccom after the first.

	It also means that the tables can potentially be reclaimed
	from memory on a subsequent execution, instead of being read
	from disk.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
