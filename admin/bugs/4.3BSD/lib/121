SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
fputs man page should mention return value

Operating System:       4.2 BSD

MODULE NAME:

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The fputs call returns the last character put.
This should be mentioned in the man page.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
Another problem is that "puts" returns whatever "putchar" returns.
However, "putchar" returns nothing.  How consistent!
A solution is to have "putchar" return what "putc" returns.

This might sound very confusing, so see the source code in directory
/usr/src/lib/libc/stdio.

CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY:
	/usr/src/lib/libc/stdio

	.:/mnt/chou/bin:/usr/new:/usr/local:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/bin:/etc

Depending on whether you're running UTX1.2 or UTX2.0, fputs
returns different things with a NULL character.
We, unfortunately, can NOT assume that fputs returns anything valid
until the specification (the manpage) says so.

The following program does different things on Burt (UTX/32 R1.2)
and Mike (UTX/32 R2.0):

#include	<stdio.h>

main ()
{
	char	buf[BUFSIZ];
	FILE	*fptr;
	
	fptr = fopen("/tmp/foo", "w");

	for (;!feof(stdin); !feof(stdin)&&!ferror(stdin)&&fgets(buf, sizeof buf, stdin) != NULL)
	{
		if (buf[0] == NULL)
		{
			printf("buf is NULL\n");
		}
		else
		{
			printf("buf:%s",buf);
		}
		if (!fputs(buf, fptr))
		{
			printf("ERROR detected by fputs\n");
		}
	}
}

In 1.2, trying to fputs(NULL, fptr) is not regarded as an error;
whereas in 2.0, this is regarded as an error.
