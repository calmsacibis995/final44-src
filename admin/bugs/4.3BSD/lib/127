Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) sendmail drops letters on floor
Index: 	lib/sendmail 4.3BSD

Description:
	When run from a terminal, sendmail will, on rare occasion, drop letters
	on the floor if TSTP'd and then CONT'd.  Now I know where some of my
	bug reports (which are filed using sendbug, which in turn uses sendmail)
	disappeared to.

	The ">>>>>>>"d lines above show where, after having "completed"
	deliver of a letter ending in a line with a "5" on it, there's still
	only a line with a "4" on it in my mailbox.

Fix:
	Well after mucking about a bit more, I discovered that sendmail was
	always getting to "deliver" before giving up the ghost.  It looks as
	the "disconnect" function called by "deliver" is less effective than
	need be.  That might be where to look for a true fix.  As a workaround,
	I've put
		trap '' 18
	lines just before the "sendmail" calls in the various bug filers.
