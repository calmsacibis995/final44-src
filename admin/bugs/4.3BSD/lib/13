Subject: getusershell.c is broken
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/getusershell.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	There are two declarations of 'static char **shells' within 
	getusershell.c (one's global and one's auto), and there is 
	some confusion about when to use which variable.
	For example, 'shells' inside getusershell() never
	gets reset once it becomes NULL.

Repeat-By:
	1) Try using the latest version of chsh sometime.
	2) Run 'main{setusershell();puts(getusershell());}', and don't
	   step in the core dump when you're finished.
	3) Successive loops through /etc/shells using getusershell()
	   require a use of endusershell() {NOT setusershell()!!} in
	   order to work.  

Fix:
	One shells variable needs to be used for free()'s and
	for initializations. and one needs to be used by getusershell()
	for 'single stepping'.  Move the 'single stepper' outside
	of getusershell() so that the other functions in getusershell.c
	can reset it.
