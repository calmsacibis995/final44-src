While you're busy redoing stdio and whatever, here's a bug, fresh from
v7, that someone here noticed back in 1979.  It's fixed in System V.

/*
 * This programs prints "1,9,'a'".
 * Shouldnt it print "0,9,'?'" ?
 */
main()
{
	int i, a;
	char b;

	a = 9;
	b = '?';
	i = sscanf("a123", "%d%c", &a, &b);
	printf("%d,%d,'%c'\n", i, a, b);
}
