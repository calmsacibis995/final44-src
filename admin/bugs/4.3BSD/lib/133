Subject: Problem with cpp: off by one line (#include <file.h)
Index: lib/cpp 4.3BSD

I noticed the following bug that is reproducible on SunOS 3.X, SunOS
4.0, and Ultrix 2.0.

Problem:
	cpp gets confused with missing ">" in include directive.
	The line numbers are off by one.

Repeat by:

	csh> cat -n bug.c
	cat -n bug.c
	     1	#include <stdio.h
	     2	main()
	     3	{
	     4		crud=12g0;
	     5	}
	csh> cc -c bug.c
	cc -c bug.c
	"bug.c", line 5: crud undefined
	"bug.c", line 5: syntax error

Note that cpp doesn't complain about the missing ">".
Also the line number is off by one.
