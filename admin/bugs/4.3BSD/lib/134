Subject: No libcrypt on non-USA gives nmake problems
Index: lib/libcrypt 4.3BSD

Description:
	On non-USA DV trees (no usa-only branch) no libcrypt is made.
	Even though all the replacement routines are in libc.a, nmake
	fails when compiling utilities that have -lcrypt on the
	source line of the :: operator in the nmake makefile. Nmake cannot
	find libcrypt.a and so exits with the error
		Dont know how to make libcrypt.a
Repeat-By:
	Go to SFO, fly to Toyko or London, get a taxi to NUC or USL,
	login, type
		cd $ROOT/usr/src/cmd/passwd
		dv nmake -f passwd.mk .INSTALL
Fix:
	In a branch lower in priority than usa-only, or maybe a new branch
	not-usa, add a libcrypt.mk makefile as below

		libcrypt.a :: dummy.c

	and create an file called dummy.c as below

		/*
		** Dummy file for libcrypt to fool nmake on non-USA releases
		*/

		char	__dummy_libcrypt;
