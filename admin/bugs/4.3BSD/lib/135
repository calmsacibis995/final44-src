Subject: getpwnam()
Index: lib/libc/gen/getpwnamuid.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Getpwnam() returns a null string for users with the default shell
	( /bin/sh, i.e. empty 7th field ) in the passwd file.

Repeat-By:
	Ftp to a machine, and try to login as a user who has no shell
	listed in the passwd file. The login will be denied by ftpd when
	it calls getpwnam().

Fix:
	I suppose this depends on the intent. Should getpwnam() in fact
	return "/bin/sh" when there's no shell field in the passwd file,
	or should the application program intuit that a null shell field
	returned by getpwnam() means "/bin/sh"? I lean more toward the
	former, but have no idea how this might affect other code.
	Suggestions are welcome.
