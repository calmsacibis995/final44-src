Subject: sscanf crashes on read-only strings.
#Index: lib 4.2BSD, also Ultrix and various others.
Index: lib/libc 4.3BSD

Description:
	When sscanf is called with a constant string that resides in
	read-only memory it dumps core. The reason is that, at some point,
	it can call ungetc(), which tries to push back a character
	to the (read-only) string.
Repeat-By:
	main() {
	    int i;
	    short j;

	    i = sscanf("1", "%hd", &j);
	    printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
	}
	-----
	Compile with 'gcc', or compile with 'cc -S' and massage the
	assembly code to get the "1" string in the text segment.
	Run.
Fix:
	A possible fix is to add a check in ungetc() so that it doesn't
	try to write the character if it's already there:
	<	*--iop->_ptr = c;
	---
	>	if( *--iop->_ptr != c ) *iop->_ptr = c;
	It is probably possible to come up with a more elegant fix,
	though:-)
