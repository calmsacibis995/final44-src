Subject: bug in mp library
Index: lib/libmp.a 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	msub in the mp routines has a bug.  It fails if both arguments
are unequal, negative numbers.
Repeat-By:
/* compile with cc test.c -lmp   */
/* J. Shallit shallit@dartmouth.edu */

#include <mp.h>

main()
{
	MINT *a, *b, *c, *d, *e, *f;

	a = itom(-10);   
	b = itom(-20);
	c = itom(0);   

	/* We subtract a-b = (-10)-(-20) and should get 10, but don't. */
	/* We get as a result -10.  This seems to happen ONLY when the */
	/* two arguments to msub are negative. */

	msub(a,b,c);   

	printf("a = ");
	mout(a);
	printf("\nb = ");
	mout(b);
	printf("\nc = ");
	mout(c);

	d = itom(10);
	e = itom(-20);
	f = itom(0);

	msub(d,e,f);

	/* Just to prove that the order of the operands is correct */

	printf("\n\nd = ");
	mout(d);
	printf("\ne = ");
	mout(e);
	printf("\nf = ");
	mout(f);

}
Fix:
