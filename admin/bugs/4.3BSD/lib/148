Subject: non-portable code in encrypt()
Index:	lib/libc/gen/crypt.c 4.3BSD and 4.3 Tahoe

Description:
	oversubscripting of "L" array if L and R arrays aren't contiguous
	to each other
Repeat-By:
	try to port crypt.c to an Evans and Sutherland ES-1.
	Do a lot of debugging when it doesn't work.
Fix:
	many possible fixes.  One of the simplest is to increase the size
	of L from 32 to 64, delete array R, and define R to be L+32.
	This isn't elegant, but it would be more work than it's worth
	to do a truly elegant fix.  Replies to doug@escd.uucp.
