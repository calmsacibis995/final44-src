Subject: fseek(3) return value
Index: 	lib/libc/stdio/fseek.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The successful return of fseek(3) is the new file offset,
	not zero, as indicated in the man page.  The man page is
	consistent with 4.2BSD.

Repeat-By:
	n = fseek(fp, 100L, 0);		/* man page sez n == 0 */

Fix:
	It's probably best to fix the man page, but this breaks
	4.2BSD programs.
