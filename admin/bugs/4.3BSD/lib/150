Subject: security bug in sendmail (5.60)
X-Us-Snail: MIT Room E40-351, 1 Amherst St., Cambridge, MA 02139 USA
Index: lib/sendmail.5.60 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a user has a .forward file specifying a program to run to
process mail, and someone on the machine uses

	/usr/lib/sendmail -odq username <filename

the program, when later executed from the queue to process the mail,
will be executed as ruid,euid daemon,daemon (1,1), instead of as the
user.

Note that in the standard 4.3BSD configuration, daemon access is
sufficient to break root via the batch facility (at).

Repeat-By:
	Create a program which prints ruid and euid somewhere, and make it the
filter for your mail. Send mail to yourself as described above.  Wait
for the queue to run, and note the uid's printed are not yours.
