Subject: Sendmail 5.61 dumps core if username > 8 chars
Index: 	 lib/sendmail/conf.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: uk-sendmail-workers@cs.hw.ac.uk

Description:
	If the value returned by "getlogin" does not match your passwd
	entry, (it has been truncated for instance), one will
	de-reference a null pointer in "username".  This results in a
	segmentation violation on a SUN
Repeat-By:
	Arrange to log in as "postmaster", attempt to send mail
Fix:
	Apply this patch.
