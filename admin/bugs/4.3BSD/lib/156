Subject: getpwent(3) does not rewind in some cases (+FIX)
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/getpwent.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	This only applies to the shadow/aging version of getpwent(3).

	The fetch_pw() function in getpwent.c in the
	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/getpwent.c code checks the
	_pw_rewind flag.  If dbm_open is called
	in start_pw after having previously processed the
	entire database and then getpwent() is called, fetch_pw still 
	thinks its processing the original dbm stream.

	Setting _pw_rewind to 1 after the dbm_open fixes the
	problem, start_pw() then knows it is dealing with a
	newly dbm_opened passwd file.

Repeat-By:
	The 'filec' code in csh(1) exposed this bug.

	If you do a ~^D for login names listing, you
	can only do it once without an intervening ~username
	action.

Fix:
