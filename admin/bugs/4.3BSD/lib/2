Subject: siglist[] does not have a name for signal 32
Index: 	lib/libc/gen/siglist.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The siglist[] array does not have the name for signal 32.
Fix:
45c45,46
< 	"User defined signal 2"		/* SIGUSR2 */
---
> 	"User defined signal 2",	/* SIGUSR2 */
> 	"Signal 32"

>>>>> Comment <<<<<

To do so would require NSIG to be increased to 33, adding 8 bytes
to the user structure and possibly breaking programs that depended
on NSIG or had 32 hard-wired in.

This bug report resulted in three fence-post conditions in the kernel
being changed so that a signal of 32 was explcitly disallowed.
