Subject: inet_addr and inet_network are unsigned long, return -1 on error
Index: lib/libc/inet/inet_{addr,network}.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Both the inet(3N) man page and the code for inet_addr (and
	probably inet_network) say that they are declared "unsigned
	long".  However, both the inet(3N) man page and the code
	for inet_addr (ditto inet_network) say they return "-1"
	on an error.
Repeat-By:
	Try compiling inet_addr.c with a compiler that complains about
	returning signed in an unsigned subroutine, or declare
	"external unsigned long inet_addr();", and then say
	"if (inet_addr(argv[1] == -1)" to a picky compiler.
Fix:
	I don't know.  There are compatibility problems.  Maybe change
	the documentation to say "return ((unsigned long) -1) on error".
