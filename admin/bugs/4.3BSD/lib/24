Subject: the syslog routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/syslog.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	syslog uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run syslog on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
136c136
< 		sigsetmask(sigblock(0) & ~sigmask(SIGALRM));
---
> 		sigsetmask(sigblock(0L) & ~sigmask(SIGALRM));
