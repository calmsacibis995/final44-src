Subject: the abort routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/abort.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	abort uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run abort on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
17c17
< 	sigblock(~0);

> 	sigblock(~0L);
