Subject: the popen routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/popen.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	popen uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run popen on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
67c67,68
< 	int child, pid, status, omask;
---
> 	int child, pid, status;
> 	long omask;
