Subject: the sleep routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/sleep.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	sleep uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run sleep on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
22c22,23
< 	int sleepx(), omask;
---
> 	int sleepx();
> 	long omask;
