Subject: the usleep routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/usleep.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	usleep uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run usleep on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
25c25,26
< 	int sleepx(), omask;
---
> 	int sleepx();
> 	long omask;
