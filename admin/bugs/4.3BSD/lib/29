Subject: the ndbm routines contain long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/ndbm.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Because of the use of an int in two ndbm routines, getbit() and
	setbit(), a limit of 128Mb is placed on ndbm .pag files on
	machines with 16 bit int's.  This is not a serious limit certainly
	but does introduce possible porting problems.
Repeat-By:
	Try creating a .pag file larger than 128Mb on a machine with 16 bit
	int's.
Fix:
