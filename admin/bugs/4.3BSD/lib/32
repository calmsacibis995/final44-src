Subject: the pause routine contains long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/gen/pause.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	pause uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run pause on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
17c17
< 	sigpause(sigblock(0));
---
> 	sigpause(sigblock(0L));
