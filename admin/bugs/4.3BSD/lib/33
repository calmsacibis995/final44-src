Subject: The inet library routines contain several long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/inet 4.3BSD

Description:
	In the routines inet_lnaof(), inet_makeaddr() and inet_netof()
	the host and net portions of an internet address are treated
	as int's.  This is incorrect on machine's whose int size is less
	that 24 bits.
Repeat-By:
	Try to use the named routines on a machine whose int size is less
	than 24 bits.
Fix:
	Note that the following fix redeclares the routines inet_lnaof()
	and inet_netof() as returning long's rather than int's which will
	cause some lint complaints.  I recommend that all three routines
	be declared in <netinet/in.h> via:

	long	inet_lnaof(), inet_netof();
	u_long	inet_makeaddr();

	to help prevent porting problems.
