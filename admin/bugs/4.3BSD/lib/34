Subject: The name server ns_addr() routine contain a long/int ambiguity,
Index: lib/libc/ns/ns_addr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Because of an attempt in the ns_addr() routine to parse the little
	used comma notation a value of 65536 is passed to a local routine
	(cvtbase) which treats that parameter as an integer.  This is
	incorrect on a machine whose int size is less than 17 bits.
Repeat-By:
	Try to feed comma notation at ns_addr on a machine whose int size
	is less than 17 bits.
Fix:
172c172,173
< 	int oldbase, newbase;
---
> 	long oldbase;
> 	int newbase;
