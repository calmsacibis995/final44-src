Subject: The getnetbyaddr routine contains a long/int ambiguity
Index: lib/libc/net/getnetbyaddr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The net argument to the getnetbyaddr routine is documented as
	being long in the getnetent.3n manual page and must be at least
	32 bits to work, but is declarded as an int in getnetbyaddr.c
Repeat-By:
	Try to use the getnetbyaddr routine on a machine whose int size
	is less than 32 bits.
Fix:
17c17,18
< 	register int net, type;
---
> 	register long net
> 	register int type;
