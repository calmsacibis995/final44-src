Subject: Re: The inet library routines contain several long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/inet 4.3BSD

Description:
	Addendum to earlier note regarding external type definitions of
	inet routines inet_lnaof(), inet_makeaddr() and inet_netof():
	Just noticed that inet_makeaddr() is declared properly
	in <arpa/inet.h>.  However the other two routines still lack
	any appropriate external definitions.  They should probably also be
	defined in <arpa/inet.h>.
