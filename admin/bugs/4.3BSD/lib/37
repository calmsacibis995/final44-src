Subject: Re: The inet library routines contain several long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/inet 4.3BSD

Description:
	(sigh) I finally did an extensive fgrep and noticed that inet_lnaof()
	and inet_netof() *are* externally typed in <netinet/in.h> (as
	u_long's - long's might be more appropriate, but it's close enough
	for now).  Please ignore my previous message regarding this lack.
	The routines themselves are however still implicitly typed as
	returning int which at the very least is in conflict with the
	declarations in <netinet/in.h> and as pointed out in the first
	note cause problems on machines with an int size shorter then 24
	bits.

	N.B. Although this glut of bug reports is coming to you under the
	name of Keith Bostic, this is really Casey Leedom.  keith Bostic
	and I are working on a mutual project and it's just eaiser to submit
	these bug reports in this manner.  He is not to be blamed for any
	of the previous stupid bug reports on this subject ... :-)
