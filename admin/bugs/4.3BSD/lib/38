Subject: the routine rcmd long/int ambiguities
Index: lib/libc/net/rcmd.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	rcmd uses int's to represent signal masks - this is non-portable
	as signal masks must be at least 32 bits.
Repeat-By:
	try to compile and run rcmd on a machine whose int size is less
	than 32 bits.
Fix:
34c34,35
< 	int s, timo = 1, pid, oldmask;
---
> 	int s, timo = 1, pid;
> 	long oldmask;
