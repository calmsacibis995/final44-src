Subject: frexp.c is not mentioned in lib/libc/gen/Makefile
Index: lib/libc/gen/Makefile 4.3BSD

Description:
	The file lib/libc/gen/frexp.c is apparently among the set of source
	implemented both in C code and VAX assembly - that set delineated as
	VAXSRC in the Makefile for that directory - since there is also a VAX
	assembly version in lib/libc/vax/gen.  frexp.c is not however
	listed in VAXSRC in lib/libc/gen/Makefile.
