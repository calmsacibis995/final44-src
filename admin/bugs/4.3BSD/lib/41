Subject: non-standard naming in lib/libc/vax
Index: 	lib/libc/vax 4.3BSD

Description:
	Many of the VAX assembly files in the "vax" area of libc area named
	foo.c.  Asside from the fact that these files are processed with the
	same preprocessor that most C programs are, what justifies calling
	them `C' files???  It's certainly deceptive and confusing enough.
Repeat-By:
	Look in the various directories under lib/libc/vax - some assembly
	files are named foo.c and others foo.s ...
Fix:
	My own recommendation is to call a spade a spade ...
