Subject: array (name, type, scope & number) problems in the C compiler
Index: lib/mip 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The 4.3 C compiler seems to have a subtle bug in its array handling
	code.  As I'm working on trying to track down a similar bug in the
	PDP-11 compiler I don't have time to find the bug myself.
Repeat-By:
	a:	extern int a[];
		main()
		{
	b:		int a[20];
		}
	c:	int a[10];

	If the above code is compiled, line `c' is flaged as a "redeclaration
	of a" - note that the "a[20]" on line `b' is local to main.  If line
	`a' is removed, the type of "a[20]" is changed to anything other than
	"int", or the array sizes on lines `b' and `c' are made to be equal,
	the compiler doesn't complain.

	If it helps any, the problem with the PDP-11 compiler is demonstrated
	by the following code:
	a:	extern int a[];
		main()
		{
	b:		extern int a[];
		}
	c:	int b;
	d:	int a[10];

	and is caused by the definition on line `b' being resolved with the
	definition on line `a'.  The compiler allocates an arrary descriptor
	thunk on the local function parse stack and then leaves a pointer to
	that thunk in the symbol allocated by line `a' in the file level parse stack
	stack.  When the function is cleaned up, the parse stack is pulled back
	to its level before the parse.  Line `d' then sucks up the space on
	the parse stack that was allocated for the array descriptor thunk on
	line `b', overwriting it.  Line `d' then causes a redeclaration error
	when the compiler creates an array descriptor for it and then compares
	it with the previously `declared' array type of "a".
