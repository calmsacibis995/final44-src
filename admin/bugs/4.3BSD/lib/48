Description:
	When cc is given the following code fragment:

		foobar()
		{
			int	gomode = 0,    auto = -1   , ssize = 0 ;

			return(auto);
		}

	it incorrectly generates the following error messages.

		"foo.c", line 3: syntax error
		"foo.c", line 3: warning: old-fashioned initialization: use =
		"foo.c", line 5: syntax error

	Clearly, it's not tokenizing the "= -1" properly, treating it as
	"auto =- 1."

Repeat-By:
	put foobar() into a file and compile it (cc foobar.c).
