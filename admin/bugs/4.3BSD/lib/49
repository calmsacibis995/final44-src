Subject: initgroups error messages violate FTP protocol
Index: lib/libc/gen/initgroups.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@Berkeley.EDU

Description:
	The initgroups(3) error message "initgroups: <user> is in too many
	groups" (and the initgroups perror message, if it ever occurs)
	output on the standard error channel.  This channel passed on to
	user FTP by server FTP, resulting in the message reaching the
	remote system.  It violates the FTP protocol in that it does not
	start with a numeric error number; this confuses at least the
	Wollongong (VMS) user FTP which hangs since the real error message
	is lost.

Repeat-By:
	Put a user in too many groups, log into another machine, (set
	verbose or whatever), connect using FTP to the original machine,
	and log in as the user in question.

Suggestion:
	Maybe initgroups should use syslog?
