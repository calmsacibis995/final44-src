Subject: space char no longer isprint() char
Index: 	lib/libc/ctype_.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The space character (octal 040) is no longer considered
	a printable character.
Repeat-By:
	if (isprint(040)) printf("I'm wrong\n");
Fix:
	Come on now.  The ctype table has not changed since V7 days
	and is the same in S3, S5, VMS C and 4.2.  Making this change
	now breaks programs unnecessarily!
