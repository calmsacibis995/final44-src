Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 cc and lint dump core (with fix)
Index: 	lib/mip/pftn.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "cc" and "lint" commands sometimes dump core.

Repeat-By:
	Using these commands:

		echo "struct {w x {y.z;x" > try.c
		/bin/cc try.c
		ls -l core
		rm core
		/usr/bin/lint try.c
		ls -l core
		rm core

	(Yes, I know the first line looks like April Foolery.
	It's the simplest code I could find that manifested the problem.)

Fix:
	We'll take the symptom stomping route on this one.

The notorious Utah PCC no longer has old-fashioned initializations, and
it has code to recover from botched initializations too, so this
example merely elicits the standard errors, 'syntax error' and 'cannot
recover from earlier errors: goodbye!'...  I don't think this fix will
be necessary but I can't prove it, of course.

When I finally install this compiler at Berkeley, I'll post my changes
log to comp.bugs.4bsd so that people will have an idea what has already
been fixed.
