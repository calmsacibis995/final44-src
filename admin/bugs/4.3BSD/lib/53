Description:
	There is a mechanism for getting the protocol number by name,
but no mechanism for getting the family number by name. The getprotoent()
routines are also specific to INET, and should encompass all protocols.

	I am trying to write a generic interface to Sun RPC where the user 
can pass a string to the rpc system indicating what kind of transport to 
run on top of. It would be nice if the user could say things like "tcp/ip", 
"spp/xns" or "tp4/iso" to get at the various transports available.  The RPC 
implementation could examine the protocol type and behave accordingly
for arbitrary protocols.

Repeat-By:
	Procedure to repeat the problem.
Fix:
	Modify the existing protocols database to include address
families.  Also, indicate type of protocol in the file. For example,

tcp/ip	6/2	stream		tcp TCP	# transmission control protocol
udp/ip	17/2	dgram		udp UDP	# user datagram protocol
spp/xns	5/6	seqpacket	spp SPP # sequenced packet protocol

	Add two fields to the protoent structure for returning the
address family and protocol type back to the user.
