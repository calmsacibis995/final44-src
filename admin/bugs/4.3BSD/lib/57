Subject: bug in cc produces 'schain botch'
Index: lib/mip/pftn.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When I compile one subroutine in my latest version of SPICE with cc,
	I get the error message:
		"MOS2load.c", line 602: compiler error: schain botch
	The problem appears to be related to symbol table manipulation
	in the compiler and doesn't occur if the same subroutine is compiled
	with -g.
Repeat-By:
	on monet.berkeley.edu, cd to ~quarles/DEV/MOS2 and 'make MOS2load.o'.
