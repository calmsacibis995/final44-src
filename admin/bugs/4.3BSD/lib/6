Subject: cpp gives *VERY* bad error message
Index: 	lib/cpp 4.3BSD

Description:
	An unterminated comment gets cpp to give the message:

		file.c:<last line>:missing endif

	How long do you think I looked for an unmatched "#if" or
	"#ifdef" before I happened to find the problem?  Do you know
	how much my hourly consulting rates are?  Thanks for the
	windfall.

Repeat-By:
	% cat > t.c
	/*
	^D
	% cc t.c
	t.c: 2: missing endif
