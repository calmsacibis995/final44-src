Subject: rcmd error message
Index: lib/libc/net/rcmd.c 4.3BSD

The following code from rcmd.c prints "hostname: Error 0" when
rcmd doesn't read a character from the remote site's rshd. Since
a system error has not occurred with the failure to read a character,
errno is 0 and the undefined system error message is printed.

8    static char sccsid[] = "@(#)rcmd.c	5.11 (Berkeley) 5/6/86";
              .
	      .
	      .
129		if (read(s, &c, 1) != 1) {
130			perror(*ahost);
131			goto bad2;
132		}

The lack of an appropriate error message made it difficult to find
the actual problem I was having with rcp; which in my case was that the
remote machine, for some reason, didn't have /etc/rshd.
