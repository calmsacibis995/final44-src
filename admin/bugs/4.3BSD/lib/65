Subject: Bug in "inet_addr"?
Index: lib/libc/inet/inet_addr.c 4.3BSD

Somebody here complained that passing "inet_addr" the string "x11"
causes it to treat that as "0x11" and consider it a valid address.
(His complaint was basically stupid, because he said the only fix was
not to have host names beginning with "x" - he *should* have called
"gethostbyname" *first* and only *then* if it failed call
"inet_addr".)

Is this a bug or a feature?  The code is:

	if (*cp == '0')
		base = 8, cp++;
	if (*cp == 'x' || *cp == 'X')
		base = 16, cp++;

It could trivially be changed to

	if (*cp == '0') {
		base = 8, cp++;
		if (*cp == 'x' || *cp == 'X')
			base = 16, cp++;
	}

which would ensure that only a leading "0x", not a leading "x", would
indicate a hex number.  Since this change is so trivial, I'm not sure
the current behavior isn't what is intended.  What *is* the intended
behavior?
