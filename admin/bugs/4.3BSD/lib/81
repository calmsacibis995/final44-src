Index: lib/libc/gen/isatty.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Calls to isatty(), such as those in stdio, can clobber errno,
	making later perror()s do strange things.  There are no doubt
	other library routines that do the same, but this is one of the
	more obvious.

Repeat-By:
	See, e.g., sendmail errors.

Fix:
	I chose to change isatty() itself, rather than _flsbuf().
	I doubt anything depends on errno==ENOTTY after isatty(n)==0.

I take issue with this.  By no stretch of the imagination is this a
bug in isatty(); errno may always be set by successful functions, and
isatty() is always successful.

The real problem is programmers who invoke perror() when errno is
not guaranteed to be set up correctly to indicate an error cause.
By installing such a change in isatty(), you're encouraging this
misuse of perror().

Agreed.  Yet I think more section-3 routines should take care with
errno; in particular, those routines that can fail due to failing
system calls should arrange to set errno always upon failing.  For
instance,

	if ((f = fopen(tmp, "w")) == NULL) {
		perror("cannot create temp file");
		...

is technically wrong, but most often produces what is desired.  It
should always produce what is desired, or there should be a better
mechanism.  (A global error number is rather grotty.)  Restoring
errno inside isatty() is not a proper fix, but may help reduce
confusion until we get one.
