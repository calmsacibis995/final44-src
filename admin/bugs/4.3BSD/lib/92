Subject: man page / lint mismatch for getsockname()
Index: lib/lint 4.3BSD

Students of cs162 have come up against a minor, but annoying bug in the
definition and documentation of getsockname().

Argument 2 is documented in the man page to be (struct sockaddr *), but
lint is only happy if it's cast to (char *).

I verified this on the machine cory.
