Subject: named library introduces global variable `conffile'

Index: lib/libc/net/res_init.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	You took one of my favourite global names!  Not fair!

Repeat-By:
	Compile any C program with

		char conffile[] = "/usr/local/foo/bar.conf";

	that also uses the name server.

	(I do think some other name, or a static char [], would be
	better.)

	The same routine then complains about an error in
	"/etc/resolv.conf", not ("... %s", conffile).

Chris
