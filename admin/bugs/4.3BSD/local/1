Subject: remote manual page program has options backwards
Index: 	local/rman/rman.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	(1) The manual page says that "-k" gives "arpopos", and "-f"
	gives "whatis", but the sense, in rman, of -k and -f are
	backwards.

	(2) rman doesn't recognize the suffix "g"

	(3) "rman cc" gives a "what do you want from section cc?" error
	message instead of giving the "cc" man page.  This is because
	"c" is a known suffix, so ...
Repeat-By:
	(1) Run "rman -k file" and see that you get "whatis" output,
	i.e., only the command "file", not the list of all man pages
	that have the keyword "file" in their summary.

	(2) "rman 1g plot"

	(3) "rman cc"
Fix:
	(1) Just switch the setting of the mode variable.

	(2) Add "g" to the list of known suffixes in the routine
	"is_suffix().

	(3)  Damned if I know.  Maybe check for only one instance of a
	known suffix?  Right now it looks like any command which
	consists of letters of known suffixes is un-rman-able.  I'd
	appreciate a fix on this, and if I fix it, the name of whom I
	can send the fix to.
