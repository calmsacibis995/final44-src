Subject: RCMD(3) is wrong about where .rhosts is found
Index: man/man3/rcmd.3 4.3BSD

Description:
	The manual page RCMD(3) claims that "ruserok" looks at the ".rhosts"
	file in the current directory.  This was true in 4.2BSD, but the
	4.3BSD version looks for it in the home directory of the local
	user.
Repeat-By:
	Read the manual, read the code.
Fix:
