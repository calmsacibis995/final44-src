Subject: problem with tocrc script
Index: man/man0/tocrc 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	In this script file for generating the table of contents and the
	permuted index, the string "s-2" is filtered out, but not the
	corresponding string "s+2".  For a string such as 
	P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2, the resultant string is
	POST\s+2SCRIPT\s+2.  This causes real problems.

Fix:
	Just add two lines to tocrc that also filter out '\s+2'.
