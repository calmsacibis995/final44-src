Subject: minor typo in vgrindefs manual entry

Description:
	There's a typo in the vgrindefs manual entry.
Repeat-By:
	Check out the word "b" in the last part of this sentence:

	This is typically used for languages (like C) which can include the
	string delimiter in a string b escaping it.

Fix:
	Change the line:

	string delimiter in a string b escaping it.

	to read:

	string delimiter in a string by escaping it.
