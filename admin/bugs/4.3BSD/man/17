Description:
	The following are some mistakes in the CTIME(3) man page:
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	     Ctime converts a long integer, pointed to by clock, such as
	     returned by time(2) into ASCII adn returns a pointer to a
			      ^		    ^^^
	     26-character string in the following form.  All the fields have
	     constant width.
	...
	     Timezone remains for compatibility reasons only; it's impos- sible
									^^
	     to reliably map timezone's arguments (zone, a "minutes west of
	     GMT" value and dst, a "daylight saving time in effect" flag) to a
	     time zone abbreviation.  It currently returns the value associated
	+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	There is no entry for time(2), only for time(3).
