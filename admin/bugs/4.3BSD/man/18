Subject: stat(2) man page, description of st_atime wrong
Index: man/stat.2 4.3BSD

Description:
	stat(2) says that the atime of a file is the "time when file
	data was last read or modified" and lists write(2) as one of
	the calls that changes the atime.

	The atime is the time when file data was last *accessed*.
	write(2) does not affect the atime.

	Otherwise, the descriptions of atime, mtime, and ctime are
	accurate.

Repeat-By:
	man stat

Fix:
	Change the man page to read:

	   st_atime	Time when file data was last accessed.  Changed
			by the following system calls:  mknod(2),
			utimes(2), read(2), and write(2).
