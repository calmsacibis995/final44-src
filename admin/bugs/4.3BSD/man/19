Subject: `ls' man page still claims `creation date'
Index: man/ls.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The description for the `-c' option claims that ls uses the
	file creation date rather than access or modification time.
	Since there is no such date, this is rather difficult to
	believe. . . .

Repeat-By:
	% man 1 ls
	/-c
