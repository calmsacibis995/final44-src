Subject: signal(3) manual page one more time
Index: 	man/man3/signal.3 4.3BSD

Description:
	The signal(3) man page doesn't include any signal with number
	greater than 27, i.e., it doesn't have URS1, URS2, or WINCH.
Repeat-By:
	man 3 signal
Fix:
	add it in, or make it reference sigvec(2) so the list only is
	maintained in one place.  By the way, sigvec(2) doesn't have
	USR1 or USR2 in it either.
