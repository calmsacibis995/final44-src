Subject: "man install" confused
Index: man 4.3BSD

Description:
	"man install" just types
		3'eV	'eV
	"man -k install" reports, among others,
		install (1)  install binaries
		install(8)   mh something or other
	However, "man 1 install" finds nothing, while "man 8 install"
	finds the install-binaries page, which is what I wanted.
Repeat-By:
	man install
	man -k install
	man 1 install
	man 8 install
