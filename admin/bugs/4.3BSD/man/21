Subject: Short summary of the problem
Index: man/man8/ifconfig.8c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Incorrect and misleading documentation for destination addresses.
Repeat-By:
	man ifconfig	:-)
Fix:

	In the ifconfig man page, it lists "dstaddr" as a "parameter",
but it isn't a keyword to the program and does not work. One solution
is to remove it entirely, since "dest_addr" is already listed in the
arg list of the man page. Another way, which is what I did, is to change
".B dstaddr" to ".I dest_addr". The name and italics are consistent with
the command line summary at the top of the man page.
