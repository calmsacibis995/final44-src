Subject: Short summary of the problem
Index: man/man1/cat.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The options are buried in the text so the man page isn't very useful.
	Not all options were listed in the command summary.
Repeat-By:
	man cat
Fix:
	I cleaned it up. There should be no substantive changes.

.SH NAME
cat \- catenate and print
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cat
[
.B \-benstuv
] [
.B \-
] [ file ... ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cat
reads each
.I file
in sequence and displays it on the standard output.  Thus
.PP
.ti+15n
cat file
.PP
displays the file on the standard output, and
.PP
.ti+15n
cat file1 file2 >file3
.PP
concatenates the first two files and places the result on the third.
.PP
If no input file is given, or if the argument `\-' is encountered,
.I cat
reads from the standard input file.
Output is buffered in 1024-byte blocks unless the standard
output is a terminal, in which case it is line buffered. 
.PP
The options are:
.TP
.B \-b
Precede non-blank output lines with sequential line numbers
beginning at 1.
.TP
.B \-e
Set the 
.B \-v
option and display a `$' character at the end of each line.
.TP
.B \-n
Display all output lines preceded by sequential line numbers
beginning at 1.
.TP
.B \-s
Crush out multiple adjacent empty lines so that the
output is displayed single spaced.
.TP
.B \-t
Set the
.B \-v
option and print tab characters as `^I'.
.TP
.B \-u
Make output completely unbuffered.
.TP
.B \-v
Display non-printing characters so that they are visible.
Control characters (other than the tab character)
print like `^X' for control-X; the delete character
(octal 0177) prints as `^?'.
Non-ascii characters (with the high bit set) are printed as `M-'
(for meta) followed by the character of the low 7 bits.

.SH BUGS
Beware of `cat a b >a' and `cat a b >b', which destroy
the input files before reading them.
