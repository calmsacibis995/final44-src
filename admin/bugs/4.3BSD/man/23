Subject: /usr/man/man0/xx is missing
Index: man/man0/xx 4.3BSD

Description:
	The man(7) template is said to be in /usr/man/man0/xx. It doesn't
	seem to be, at least not in my Mt. Xinu distribution.
Repeat-By:
	ls /usr/man/man0/xx
Fix:
	Please put it back or change the man page on man(7). I'd prefer the
	former...
