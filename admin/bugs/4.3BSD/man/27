Subject: Lint and man page for getsockname() disagree
Index: man 4.3BSD

Description:
	The manual page for getsockname() claims that the second
	argument should be of type (struct sockaddr *).  Lint,
	however, believes that the second argument is a (char *).
Repeat-By:
	man getsockname
Fix:
	The man page is probably correct.  Whatever lint uses to
	type check library routines ought to be modified so that
	it agrees with the man page.
