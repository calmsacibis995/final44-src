Subject: plot.3x manual page not quit correct
Index: man/man3/plot.3x 4.3BSD

Description:
	The description of the various libraries has a typo.  About midway
	down the list of plot libraries, the entry "-lplot" occurs again
	with the description of "DEC Gigi terminals" associated with it.  I
	think that you really want "-lplotgigi" and not "-lplot".  Very
	minor typo, but thought I would point it out for the next release.

Repeat-By:
	run "man 3x plot"

Fix:
	*** 104,110 ****
	  .br
	  .ns
	  .TP
	! .B \-lplot
	  DEC Gigi terminals
	  .br
	  .ns
	--- 104,110 ----
	  .br
	  .ns
	  .TP
	! .B \-lplotgigi
	  DEC Gigi terminals
	  .br
	  .ns
