Subject: "sed" supports comments, but this is undocumented
Index: 	man/man1/sed.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	"sed" supports comments in scripts.  Any line containing an
	option string of white space (blanks or tabs) followed by a
	"#" is a comment and will be ignored by "sed".

	Furthermore, if the *first* comment line is of the form

		#n

	the "sed" script will be executed as if the "-n" flag were
	specified.
Repeat-By:
	Check out "fcomp" in "sed0.c".
Fix:
	Document it.  (S5's "sed" supports the "#n" feature, so it's
	probably been in there since V7; S5 even documents it.)
