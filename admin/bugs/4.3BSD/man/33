Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) fmt command is misdocumented (with fix)
#Index: man/man1/fmt.1 MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: man/man1/fmt.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The fmt(1) manual page lacks a description of fmt's line-length
	setting option; it also says that "The spacing at the beginning
	of the input lines is preserved in the output. . ." when, in
	reality, only relative indents are preserved.

Repeat-By:
	To see the undocumented option in action, use the command
		fmt /usr/man/cat1/fmt.1
	followed by the command
		fmt -40 /usr/man/cat1/fmt.1

	To see that only relative indentation is preserved, use the command
		(echo " a"; echo " b"; echo " c") | fmt

Fix:
	One option is to both remove the undocumented option and make the
	handling of spacing at the beginning of the input lines match the
	documentation.  The other option is to change the documentation,
	along the lines shown below.  (Apologies are in order; while I was
	in the neighborhood, I couldn't resist the opportunity to 
	deverbificationalize the writeup.)

  The program was designed to be simple and fast \- for more complex
! operations, the standard text processors are likely to be more appropriate.
