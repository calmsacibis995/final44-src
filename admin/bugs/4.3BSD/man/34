Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 ps documentation doesn't match performance (with fix)
#Index: man/man1/ps.1 MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: man/man1/ps.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The documentation for the "ps" command doesn't match the command's
	performance.
Repeat-By:
	Do a
		man ps | sed 's/_.//g;20q'
	and note the output:

> ...	
>	DESCRIPTION
>	     Ps prints information about processes.  Normally, only your
>	     processes are candidates to be printed by ps; specifying a
>	     causes other users' processes to be candidates to be
>	     printed; specifying x includes processes without control
>	     terminals in the candidate pool.

	Next, log in on an account that has /bin/csh as its login shell.
	Do a
		sleep 3600 &
	to put a long-running job in background.  Do a
		ps
	and note that the sleep command is listed in the output.  Log out;
	log back on; do a
		ps
	command and note that the sleep command is no longer listed.  Finally,
	do a
		ps x
	and note that the job has a control terminal, and hence should have
	been listed without using the 'x' option which, according to the
	manual page, should only exclude processes without control terminals.

Fix:
