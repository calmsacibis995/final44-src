Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 adb's 'w' command lengthens files (only worth documenting)
Index: man/man1/adb.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The adb command writes four bytes of data when two-byte writes are
	requested; this makes files grow unexpectedly if a write is done near
	the end of a file.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Wed Mar 18 19:30:41 1987
	$ echo x > try
	$ ls -l try
	-rw-r--r--  1 ado             2 Mar 18 19:30 try
	$ adb -w try
	0?d
	0:		2680
	0?w 0t2679
	0:		a78	=
	text address not found
	^D$ ls -l try
	-rw-r--r--  1 ado             4 Mar 18 19:31 try
	$ od -c try
	0000000    w  \n  \0  \0
	0000004

Fix:
	It's not worth fixing; it is worth documenting.

  Since no shell is invoked to interpret the arguments of the
  .B :r
  command, the customary wild-card and variable expansions cannot occur.

+ When you're two bytes shy of the end of a file, writing two bytes makes it grow.
