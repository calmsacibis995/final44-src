Subject: "SEE ALSO"s lead frazzled systems programmer down garden path
Index: man/man*/* 4.3BSD

Description:
	Some "SEE ALSO" manual page sections contain pointers to nonexistent
	manual pages.

Repeat-By:
	Trying to fix an obscure bug quickly.

	No fix here, just an awk/sed/grep generated list of bad references,
	along with the manual pages that contain them and some notes.
