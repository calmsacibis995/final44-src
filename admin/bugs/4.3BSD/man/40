Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 vhangup(2) manual page is outdated (with fix)
#Index: man/man2/vhangup.2 MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: man/man2/vhangup.2 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The vhangup(2) manual page contains erroneous information.

Repeat-By:
	Type in the command
		man vhangup | sed -n 12,16p
	and read the results:

	DESCRIPTION
	     Vhangup is used by the initialization process init(8) (among
	     others) to arrange that users are given "clean"' terminals
	     at login, by revoking access of the previous users'
	     processes to the terminal.  To effect this, vhangup searches

	Then note that the vhangup call has been removed from the MORE/bsd 4.3
	version of init.

Fix:
	Here's a "diff -c" listing for "man/man2/vhangup.2".

- (among others) to arrange that users are given
- \*(lqclean\*(rq' terminals at login,
- by revoking access of the previous users' processes to the terminal.
- To effect this,
- .I vhangup
  searches the system tables for references to the control terminal
  of the invoking process, revoking access permissions
  on each instance of the terminal that it finds.
  Further attempts to access the terminal by the affected processes
  will yield i/o errors (EBADF).
! Finally,
  a hangup signal (SIGHUP) is sent to the process group of the
  control terminal.
