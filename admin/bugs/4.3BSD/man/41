Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 phones documentation doesn't match program performance
#Index: man/man5/phones.5 MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: man/man5/phones.5 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "phones" writeup in manual section 5 doesn't seem to match the
	performance of the tip program.

Repeat-By:
	First use the command
		man phones | sed 's/_.//g;12q'
	and note the output:

>	PHONES(5)           UNIX Programmer's Manual            PHONES(5)
>	
>	
>	NAME
>	     phones - remote host phone number data base
>	
>	DESCRIPTION
>	     The file /etc/phones contains the system-wide private phone
>	     numbers for the tip(1C) program.  This file is normally
>	     unreadable, and so may contain privileged information.  The

	Now try changing the "/etc/phones" file so that it's readable only
	by the owner of the (set-user-id) tip command, then try doing a
		tip system-name
	where "system-name" is the name of a system that appears in the
	phones file.  Note the output:
		/etc/phones: can't open phone number file

Fix:
	We're friendly folk here; we just made the /etc/phones file readable
	by everyone.  This solution may not be acceptable at other sites.
