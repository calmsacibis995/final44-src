Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) tty(4) manual page is misleading (with fix)
Index: man/man4/tty.4 4.3BSD

Description:
	The tty(4) manual page describes some of IOCTL's parameters this way:

	     TIOCEXCL	    Set "exclusive-use" mode: no further opens
			    are permitted until the file has been closed.

	     TIOCNXCL	    Turn off "exclusive-use" mode.

	     TIOCHPCL	    When the file is closed for the last time,
			    hang up the terminal.  This is useful when
			    the line is associated with an ACU used to
			    place outgoing calls.

	This misleads some readers (okay, I confess:  it misleads *me*)
	into thinking that exclusive-use mode is cancelled when a file
	has been closed, rather than when it is closed "for the last time"
	(that is, when the last process that has it open closes it).

Repeat-By:
