Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 more(1) writeup doesn't tell of b, ^B, and ^L limits
Index: man/man1/more.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	The manual entry for the more(1) command fails to note
	that the b, ^B, and ^L commands cannot be used when the input to
	more is coming from a pipe.

Repeat-By:
	Use the command
		nroff -man /usr/man/man1/more.1 | more
	to review the documentation.  While reviewing it, try using the
	b, ^B, and ^L commands described therein.

Fix:
	Add the following to the BUGS section at the end of the document.

	.PP
	The
	.BR b ,
	.BR ^B ,
	and
	.B ^L
	commands do not work when
	.IR more 's
	input is coming from a pipe.
