PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low) 5

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The 1.2 distributed man-page says:

Gethostname returns the standard host name for the current processor, as
previously set by sethostname.  The parameter namelen specifies the size of
the name array, and is modified on return to indicate the actual size of the
host name returned.  The name is null-terminated unless insufficient space
is provided.

The part in error is where it says "namelen ... is modified on return to
indicate the actual size of the host name returned."

The gethostname() syscall does not return the actual length in namelen --
see /sys/sys/kern_xxx.c.

The SYNTAX section is correct, but the description is wrong.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT: see above

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script) man gethostname

SUGGESTED FIX:
The paragraph should read:

Gethostname returns the standard host name for the current processor, as
previously set by sethostname.  The parameter namelen specifies the size of
the name array.  The returned name is null-terminated unless insufficient
space is provided.
