'pa' option not documented on /etc/remote manpage

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)
2 (it's very irritating if you are the one working on it for 3 days)
DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
the parity-setting options in remote are not documented on the
UTX manpages.  'man  remote' on the vax gets you the information
you need regarding the 'pa' capability, but no mention at all
is made of this option on al or mycroft or fang.  you need to
know this if you want tip to talk to funny boxes.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

man remote
HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
man remote
SUGGESTED FIX:
insert proper documentation.
OTHER COMMENTS:
the code is in tip to read and recognize the pa capability
and it does work properly;  you just cant find out about
it under UTX.
