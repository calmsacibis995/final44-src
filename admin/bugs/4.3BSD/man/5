Subject: 4.[123]bsd man (really more) misdoes "man sort" (legible workaround)

Index:	man/man1/sort.1 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The "sort" manual page is misdisplayed on terminals such as VT100s
	due to a bug in the "more" command.

Repeat-By:
	Hop on a VT100 or equivalent and use the command
		man sort

Fix:
	Rather than wasting more time dealing with more more bugs, change
	the line in the file "man1/sort.1" that reads:

		.if n -mubdfinrt^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H_________x

	(where "^H" represents a backspace character) to read:

		.if n -_^Hm_^Hu_^Hb_^Hd_^Hf_^Hi_^Hn_^Hr_^Htx
