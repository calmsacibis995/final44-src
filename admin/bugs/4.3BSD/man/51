DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
   Not a bug, just an inconsistency in documentation. renice used to work by
   munging in /dev/kmem and /vmunix. It no longer does this since
   there is a setpriority (set nice value) system call. The man page has
   not been changed.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
   Remove references to /dev/kmem and /vmunix in FILES section of man page.
