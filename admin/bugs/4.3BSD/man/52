MODULE NAME:
getsockopt

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)
Software/Doc depends on how you look at it

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The getsockopt(2) man page doesn't say you cannot set
the option name to be either SO_ACCEPTCONN or SO_DONTLINGER.
According to the routine sogetopt() in uipc_socket.c, 
these two options will not be recognized and errno will
be set to EINVAL. 

If this is exactly what we want, then man page has to state
this explicitly. Otherwise, we need to change the code to
accept these two options.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
