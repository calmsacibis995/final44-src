listen (2) manpage

MODULE NAME:
	listen(2) manpage

TYPE:
	documentation

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	the manpage states that "the listen call applies only to sockets
	of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_PKTSTREAM", but this is false because
	i tested the listen call with SOCK_DGRAM and it passed and did not
	return EOPNOTSUPP as manpage states.  in fact, setting errno to 
	EOPNOTSUPP is not to be found in any of the listen routines.

	under special conditions the manpage says:

		9 	The backlog is currently limited (silently) to 5.

	what is the '9' ???  EBADF (errno 9) doesn't seem to apply here.
