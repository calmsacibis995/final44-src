DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The first line of the file is wrong.  Because of this, the file is not put
through the neqn or eqn filter.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
change the first line of the file from 
'/" e
to
'\" e
OTHER COMMENTS:
Also since eqn is not part of the system,  the output from this manpage looks
terrible.
