DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The SYNTAX of mt(1) says

	mt [-t tapename] command [count]
	mt [-f tapename] command [count]

but nowhere in the man page tells me what are '-t' and '-f'
for. I checked the code and found out that there is no
difference whether you specify -t or -f.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
