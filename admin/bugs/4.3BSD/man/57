DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The manpage for mtab does not mention the include file <mtab.h>
that provides the structure definition so that you can read the
thing.  Reading the file according to the manpage gets you
bogus information--real bogus.  A new field has been added since
the manpage was written, which looks like it was grabbed without
touching it from BSD.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
type man mtab
HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
type man mtab
SUGGESTED FIX:
rewrite it.  it's not that long.
