DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The SYNTAX of mt (1) says:
	mt [-t tapename] command [count]
	mt [-f tapename] command [count]

There is nowhere in the man page tells me what the differences
in specifying -t or -f. I went to look at the code and found
out that there is no difference at all. '-t' <=> '-f'
Please add a line to tell people that -t and -f have the
same effect.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
