Description:  The manual pages for sigblock(2), sigpause(2), sigsetmask(2)
	and sigvec(2) describe signal masks as "int"s.  This is wrong.  They
	are "long"s.

	The manual pages for execve(2), sigvec(2) and siginterrupt(3) fail to
	make clear that the SV_INTERRUPT attribute of a signal is *not*
	reset on execve(2).

Fix:  Fix the manual pages.  If you want, I have a complete revised set, but
	that set includes added notes for the PDP-11 implementation of the
	4.3 signal facilities.

	Note that because of the current "int" definition of sigmask's many,
	many programs are non-portable to machines whose integer size is less
	than 32 bits.

	Also note that in addition to the changes necessary in <sys/signal.h>
	for "long" sigmask's in the sigvec and sigcontext structures, the
	definition of the "sigmask" macro needs to be changed:

	*** /usr/include/sys/signal.h: 114:
	< #define	sigmask(m)	(1 << ((m)-1))
	---
	> #define	sigmask(m)	(1L << ((m)-1))
