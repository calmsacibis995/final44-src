could be specified.

Option file, it should also say the default is stdin.

For -m, it would be better to say, "If any other options are specified with
-m the -m will be ignored, and the specified files will be sorted
separately."

where it says 'very long lines will be silently truncated'
change it to read 'lines longer than BUFSIZ or 1024 bytes'
(i forget which it uses).....
