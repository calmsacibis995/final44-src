DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
Under SYNTAX of install(1),
	install [-c] [-m mode] [-o owner] [-g group] [-s] binary destination

Instead of using "binary", it should use "executable".

If this change is made, all the "binary" that is used in this man page
should be changed to "executable", and "executable" should be italicized.
