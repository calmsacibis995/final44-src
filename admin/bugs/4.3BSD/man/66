DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The last paragraph of DESCRIPTION, it says
	"...If interrupted with a quit signal (generated by a 
	 <control-e>), last ..."

The phrase of "(generated by <control-e>)" should be removed.

Under the EXAMPLES, 
	fred   tty17   Mon Feb 27 10:13   still logged in

There should have at least 10 more spaces between tty17 and Mon.
We should also note that if there is networking on the system
the host name will appear between tty?? and date.

It might be more useful to change the (generated by control-e) to something
like (by default, generated by control-\) instead of deleting it altogether.
