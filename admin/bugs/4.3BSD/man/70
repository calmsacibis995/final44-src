DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
In general, wherever it uses HOME directory, it should be
$HOME directory.

Under SYNTAX, it has
	/usr/lib/vacation {-I or user}
instead, it should be
	/usr/lib/vacation {-I|user}

Under EXAMPLE:
It has
	"If a user goes on vacation, run:"
It should be
	"If a user goes on vacation, he must run:"

Then
	"...to be sent as return mail. Then add an alias to /usr/lib/aliases..."
It should be
	"...to be sent as return mail. Then an administrator must add an alias
	 to /usr/lib/aliases ..."
	
Also, we should add a sentence after the last sentence in EXAMPLE, which is

	"When the vacationing user returns, the entry in /usr/lib/aliases
	 should be deleted."

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
