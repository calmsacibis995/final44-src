DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
1. Under SYNTAX, 
	cat [-option] file...
   it should be
	cat [-b][-e][-n][-s][-t][-u][-v] file...

   (Isn't this stupid? Actually, I would prefer the code to change
    to recognize "cat -et file ...".)

2. Under OPTIONS:
 	"-e    when specified with the -v option, displays a dollar sign($)
	       at the end of each line."

	"-t    when specified with the -v option, displays tab characters
	       as ^I."

	The truth for this option is "cat -e file..." == "cat -e -v file..."
				 and "cat -t file..." == "cat -t -v file..."
        You don't need to specify -e with -v inorder to perform what it
	says above.
