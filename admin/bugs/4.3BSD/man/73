DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
lock(1) man page should list out all the keys that 'lock'
will ignore such as (ctrl-z).

It should also tell user to hit RETURN after the user typed
in the key to unlock his terminal. (Sometimes user uses,
e.g. ESC, as the terminal locked key, and when the user
wants to unlock his terminal, he just presses ESC and expects
a prompt from the terminal, it is all because he forgets
to hit RETURN.)
