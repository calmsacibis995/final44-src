DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
Under SYNTAX, it says

	file     specifies the file to be stripped. Archive files
		 will have the local symbols from any a.out format
		 files removed.

This makes it sound like you should be able to strip the local
symbols off all the .o's in a archive.

Therefore, the last sentence should be changed to
	"a.out format files that have the loccal symbols will be removed."
