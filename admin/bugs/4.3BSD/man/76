DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
Under the option -f with flag c, it says,

	"cceil  specifies the highest release ...a number less than
	 or equal to 9999,.... The default value for an unspecified
	 c flag is 9999."

First of all, we should say
	"...a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 9999,.."

Secondly, you have to specify the c flag inorder to get the default
ceiling value of 9999, so the last sentence should be changed to,

	"The default ceiling value is 9999. (The c flag must be
	 specified, otherwise an error results.)

Not exactly.  My complaint is the sentence:

	"The default value for an unspecified c flag is 9999."

Why was the phrase "an unspecified c flag" confusing to me?  At first I
thought it meant "an unspecified argument to the c flag," when it really
means "given no c flag" the default value of cceil is 9999.  I guess I
just don't like being "given nothing."

A better way to say this is "The default value for cceil is 9999",
period--for what is a default value, other than the value when a flag
is "unspecified" or "not there."  "An unspecified flag" is extraneous.

"Better understanding through simplification."
