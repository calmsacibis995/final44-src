DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
One sentence has been skipped in the section "Nonbuilt_In Command Execution"
(page 20) in csh man page.

The second paragraph begins with "Thus, (cd ; pwd) ; pwd prints the home
directory; leaving you where you were........".  The first sentence of the
paragraph should begin with "Parenthesized commands are always executed in a
subshell". (look at the 4.2BSD documentation)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Look at the csh man page (page 20) in the UTX/32 BSD User's Reference Manual.
