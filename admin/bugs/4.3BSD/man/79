setreuid & setregid manpages wrong

Operating System:       4.2 BSD

MODULE NAME:
setreuid (2) and setregid (2) manpages

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The above-mentioned manpages state that only the super  user  can
change the real user (group) id of a process.  This is incorrect.
Any user can change the real user (group)  id  to  the  effective
user (group) id of a process.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Compile the following program, make it setuid (not to root),  and
have  someone  other  than the owner (and the super user) run it.
Notice that the real user id is changed by the setreuid call.

==================================================================
#include <stdio.h>

main ()
{
	int	ret;

	printf ("real user ID = %d\n", getuid ());
	printf ("eff  user ID = %d\n", geteuid ());

	printf ("\nafter setreuid (%d, -1)\n", geteuid ());

	ret = setreuid (geteuid (), -1);

	printf ("real user ID = %d\n", getuid ());
	printf ("eff  user ID = %d\n", geteuid ());

	printf ("return value = %d\n", ret);
}
==================================================================

The program only tests this for the  setreuid  syscall;  however,
the kernel code for setreuid (in /usr/src/sys/sys/kern_prot.c) is
essentially the  same  as  the  code  for  the  setregid  syscall
located in the same file.

SUGGESTED FIX:
Change the manpages to state that an uprivileged user can  change
the  real  user  (group)  id  of  a process to the effective user
(group) id of a process, and that a super  user  can  change  the
real user (group) id to anything.

I wonder whether you should fix the man page instead of the code.
It does not seem right that the real user id should be changed by
anyone other than the superuser, in a login-type process.
