Subject: Incorrect Documentation REBOOT(8)
Index: 	man 4.3BSD

Description:
	Documentation is incorrect, or reader is at fault. The
	reboot documentation (REBOOT(8)) indicates that the boot device
	type is set in register 10 as the device major number, and
	that the flags and minor device number are placed in register
	11.  'The register is used in four one-byte fields
	from least to most significant, they are boot flags (as defined
	in <sys/reboot.h>), disk partition, drive unit, and adaptor
	number (UNIBUS or MASSBUS as appropriate).' 
	
Repeat-By:
	reading documentation
Fix:
	Correct documentation to indicate boot flags, disk partition, drive
	unit and adaptor number are required in register 10.
