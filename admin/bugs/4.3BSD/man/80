MODULE NAME:
/usr/man/man1/man.1
BUG PORTED TO UTX?
Yes, except [section] is now [chapter]
DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The manpage for man(1) neglects to mention that [section] doesn't have to
be an arabic number, but can be "local", "new", "old", or "public"

For example:
$ man local troff	/* NOT man l troff  */
$
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
$ man man
