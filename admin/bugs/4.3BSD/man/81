strings(1) man page lies

Operating System:       4.3 BSD

MODULE NAME:	strings(1)

BUG PORTED TO UTX? yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The man page describes a -o option, which is supposed to give an offset
in octal for each string found. It actually gives the offset in decimal.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Run 'strings -o' on a random file. Observe offsets containing 8's and
9's. Or if you aren't observant, blindly ask adb to convert such a
number for you and wonder why it says syntax error.

SUGGESTED FIX:
Either the man page or the code should be changed; shouldn't much matter

which.
