Subject: tbl man page error
Index: man/tbl.1 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The man page for tbl needs .TS and .TE in the description to be
        commented out from *roff.
Repeat-By:
	Try to make sense of what `man tbl` gives you, then read the 
        source for the man page.
Fix:
	Put "\&" before ".TS" and ".TE" in the description of tbl.
