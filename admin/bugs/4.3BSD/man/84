Subject: Short summary of the problem
Index: 	man/man8/rmt.8c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	RMT(8C) lies when it describes the protocol.  It claims that there is a
	space between the tokens of the commands.  In fact, there is a
	*newline* after each of the arguments to the commands (or after the
	command, if it takes no arguments), and there is no separator between
	the command and its first argument.
Repeat-By:
	Read the manual, then read "rmt.c".
Fix:
