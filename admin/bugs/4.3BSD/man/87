Subject: Short summary of the problem
Index: 	man/man5/aliases.5 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Alias names are case insensitive (see readaliases() in
	usr.lib/sendmail/src/alias.c), but that fact isn't documented;
	which can lead to bogus aliases like:

		postmaster: root
		Postmaster: postmaster

Repeat-By:
	Examine all alias files on all hosts running sendmail -- just
	kidding.  Cli.COM did just that, it's fixed now.

Fix:
	Just add a sentence in the first paragraph stating that alias
	names are case insensitive.
