Subject: getservbyport() is poorly documented
Index: 	man/getservent.3n 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The fact that getservbyport()'s "port" argument should be
	given in network byte-order instead of host byte-order is
	counterintuitive and should be documented.

Repeat-By:
	Read the man page.

Fix:
	Add a comment in the man page to change it from this:

     Getservbyname and getservbyport sequentially search from the
     beginning of the file until a matching protocol name or port
     number is found,  

	To this:

     Getservbyname and getservbyport sequentially search from the
     beginning of the file until a matching protocol name or port
     number (which should be  given  in	 network  byte-order)  is
     found,
