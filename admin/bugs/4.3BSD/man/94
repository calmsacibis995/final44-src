Subject: suggested enhancement to sysline(10 manual page
Index: man/man1/sysline.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	Sysline says it works for a vt100.  It does, but only if you know
	enough to set your TERM to vt100-s or vt100-s-bot.  Unfortunately,
	lots of my naive users don't know that and are puzzled when sysline
	says "no status line"....  The suggested enhancements below might
	alleviate their confusion.  (Probably not, but it's worth a try. :-)

Repeat-By:
	look at the manual page, run sysline with TERM=vt100, note the
	message from sysline.
Fix:
RCS file: RCS/sysline.1,v
retrieving revision 4.3.1.1
diff -c -r4.3.1.1 sysline.1
