Subject: suggested enhancement for sed(1) manual page
Index: man/man1/sed.1 4.3BSD

Description:

	Sed doesn't do anything with input that doesn't have at least
	one newline.  This is to be expected, and if you read closely
	in the existing manual page it's implied.  I'd suggest adding
	the lines in the "Fix:" to the sed manual page to clarify it.
	Sed's behavior confused one of our customers and this probably
	would have allowed them to discover what was going on without
	asking me.

Repeat-By:
	inspection

Fix:
Add these lines to the end of /usr/man/man1/sed.1
.SH BUGS
.I Sed
operates on lines and will do nothing unless the input contains at least
one newline character.
