Subject: vacation(1) manual page should indicate full path in .forward
Index: man/man1/vacation.1 4.3BSD

Description:
	Under certain conditions for which I don't have a reliable repeat-by
	(sorry), sendmail fails to execute programs invoked in a .forward,
	probably because it's using execve and doesn't have access to the
	original user's path.  This usually shows up when people invoke
	vacation in a .forward as

		\login, "!vacation login"
	
	instead of

		\login, "!/usr/ucb/vacation login"
	
	My guess is that this happens when the original letter doesn't
	get delivered interactively but by a queue run, which doesn't
	have the same access to the user's environement?  It would be
	a good thing if the vacation(1) manual page indicated that you
	should use a full pathname in the vacation invocation, because
	things always work when you do that.

	This should really be documented in the manual page that
	documents .forwards, but there isn't one. :-)  The only
	documentation (other than the source code) of .forward handling
	of which I am aware is in section 2.5 of "Sendmail installation
	and operation guide," but that doesn't mention that you can
	invoke a program from the .forward or how to do it.  A manual
	page documenting this would be really helpful, because more and
	more people are starting to invoke things like elm's "filter"
	program and MH's "slocal" from .forwards.

Repeat-By:
	create a .forward like the one above and wait until someone
	gets mail from mailer-daemon complaining about "unknown mailer
	error 1".
Fix:
	change the suggested invocation of vacation in its manual page.
	I realize this is only one program of many that people invoke
	from their .forwards, but it's probably the most popular one for
	now at least.
