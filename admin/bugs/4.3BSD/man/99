Subject: rdump(8c) seems to be missing some information
Index: 	man/rdump.8c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:

	The manual page for rdump(8c) doesn't quit match the source.
	Rdump(8c) executes an rcmd(3) to connect to the remote host.
	Although this requires root priviledges, there is an
	undocumented way around putting the local hostname in root's
	.rhosts file on the remote machine.

Repeat-By:

	According to the manual page, the -f option is specified in
	the form of 'machine:device'.  In actuality, the -f option may
	be specified in the form 'machine.user:device'.  Try
	specifying the -f option both ways with an account that does
	have access to the remote tape drive other than root.

Fix:
	I added some text to the manual page to include the
	undocumented section.  I included the entire manual page
	below.
