SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
    co should have a -u option

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500

MODULE NAME:
    rcs
BUG PORTED TO UTX? 

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
    This is trivial, but... I thought that I was the only person
    bothered by ci having -l/-u options, but co having only -l,
    with -u being the default. However, I am now sure that it isn't
    just me - my office mate asked me.

    In the interests of uniformity, co should have a -u option.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
    So, it's an enhancement request. How else do we make them?
    BTW, I have a slightly fixed version of RCS that has co -u,
    as well as other things.

RCS is part of the User Contributed software, not the official
distribution.  So you should send your request to the author.
