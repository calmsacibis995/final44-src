DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
One of the options for admin is -a and then you have to specify
a login name or numerical group ID. No matter what you specify,
admin does not look up /etc/group or /etc/passwd to see if
the specified names or ID are valid.

Another option is -e with a specified login name or numerical
group ID. This option will erase the user/s from the list
of users allowed to make changes to the SCCS files. In the
man page, it says,

	"Specifying a group ID is equivalent to specifying 
	 all login names common to that group ID."

Well, this is not true, if an individual login name is in
the list of users allowed to make changes, unless the code
checks and gets rid of all the related login names in the
existing list of users.
