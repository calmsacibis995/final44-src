MODULE NAME: rcs/ci

BUG PORTED TO UTX? yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:

ci will allow you to check in a file with a state (-s) that will corrupt the
rcs file. Putting a space in the state name will do awful things to the rcs

file, but ci doesn't bother to check for them. Similarly for : and a few
others.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
% ci -s'XXX YYY' test
% rlog test
rlog error, line 9: Missing ';' after state
rlog error, line 9: Missing branches
rlog aborted

RCS file:        RCS/test,v;   Working file:    test
head:            1.2
locks:           wombat: 1.2;  strict
access list:   
symbolic names:
comment leader:  "# "

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

This also happens if you put a space in a symbolic name (ci -n"X Y" <file>).
