Subject: Short summary of the problem

Description:
	In bib standard reference format, in a book style reference, the
	macro package doesn't correctly handle the single versus multiple
	editors case.

	The problem is caused by a misformated ".ie" macro call.  If you
	have old-style nroff or troff, the problem just shows up as a
	failure to print "(editors)" when multiple editors are given
	(it prints "(editor)" instead).  Under Device Independent Troff,
	the same bug may cause subsequent formatting screwups.

Repeat-By:
	Unpack the shar file given below.  This will create 4 files:
	patch, txt.ms, refs, and correct.  Run the commands:
		invert refs
		bib <txt.ms | nroff -ms | colcrt | cat -s
	and examine the output.  The file "correct" contains
	what you should get as output.
Fix:
	Unpack the shar file given below, apply the patch contained
	in the file "patch".
