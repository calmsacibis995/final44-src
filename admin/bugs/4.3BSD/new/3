Subject: RCS will clobber a directory if you try to check it in
Index: 	new/rcs/src/ci.c 4.3BSD +FIX
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	RCS "ci" will attempt to check in any file, including special
	files and directories.  Run by a normal user and given a
	directory, ci will produce a junk RCS file.  For the super
	user, it will unlink the original entry, leaving the contents
	of the directory inaccessible and the filesystem corrupt.  The
	filesystem must be unmounted and fsck run to relink the
	directory into lost+found.  If you've ever found a directory of
	RCS files in a lost+found, this is probably how it got there.

	This bug has been in every version of RCS I've seen, and wasn't
	fixed by Guy Harris' previously posted RCS patches.

Repeat-By:
	(as root)
	# mkdir RCS
	# ls -l
	total 1
	drwxr-xr-x  2 root          512 Mar 17 17:58 RCS/
	# ci RCS
	RCS/RCS,v  <--  RCS
	initial revision: 1.1
	enter description, terminated with ^D or '.':
	NOTE: This is NOT the log message!
	>> test
	>> ^D
	done
	ci error: Can't find semaphore file RCS/,RCS,
	# ls -l
	total 0
	# ^D

Fix:
	Apply the following patch:
