Subject: repl(1) dumps core + fix
Sender: ace!henk@okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU
Index: new/mh/uip/replsbr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The repl(1) command, part of MH-6.4, dumps core on mc68000
	machines.  The command allocates an array of pointers,
	with each pointer pointing to an allocated buffer.
	The buffers are freed by a loop that stops on the first NULL
	pointer.  This happens to work OK on a VAX, presumably because
	calloc() returns a larger piece of memory than was requested.
	On my machine it doesn't.

Repeat-By:
	Use repl(1) on an mc68000 machine.

Fix:
	A quick hack: calloc() an extra field in the array of pointers.
	This field is initialised to NULL and will end the loop that
	frees all allocated buffers.
