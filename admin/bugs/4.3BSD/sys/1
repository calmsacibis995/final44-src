Subject: in.h header file
Index: sys/netinet/in.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	This header file still contains a description and macros for
	RFC936 style internet subnets, though in.c actually implements
	a masking scheme compatible with RFC940.
Repeat-By:
	Examination.
Fix:
	Remove the subnet description and macros from in.h, since the macros
	appear not to be used anywhere, and the description is now wrong.
