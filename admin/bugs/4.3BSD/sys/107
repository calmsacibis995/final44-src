Subject: DTR intermittently lost on DHV11 lines.
Index:  sys/tty.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
        Getty got intermittently hung in dhuopen() waiting for carrier
        to come up when the DTR signal was off. Killing the getty process
        would alleviate the problem. I suspect the cause is a long delay
        in detecting carrier drop, since it is passed in the input silo.
Repeat-By:
        Happens now and again on DHV11/MicrovaxII.
Fix:
        The following change "#ifdef'd GOO" seems to fix it up:
        ...lines 635-645 in sys/tty.c
          else if (flag == 0)
                /*
                 * Lost carrier.
                 */
                tp->t_state &= ~TS_CARR_ON;
        #ifdef GOO
                if ((tp->t_state&TS_ISOPEN) && (tp->t_state&TS_WOPEN) == 0)
        #else
                if (tp->t_state & TS_ISOPEN)
        #endif
                        if ((tp->t_flags & NOHANG) == 0)
