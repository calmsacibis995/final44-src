Subject: "make links" makes too many links

Index: 	sys/bbnnet/udp_usrreq.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	udp_usrreq.o will be different depending on whether you have
	config'd for netinet or bbnnet.  However, "make links" will
	link udp_usrreq.o to ../GENERIC/udp_usrreq.o.  This means that
	if you have two systems, one with netinet config'd, and one
	with bbnnet config'd, the first make will compile udp_usrreq.c
	from the appropriate directory, and the second kernel will not
	recompile this file, but attempt to load it with the other
	files.
Repeat-By:
	Make two file in /sys/conf:  NETINET and BBNNET.  In NETINET have
	the line: "pseudo-device	inet".  In BBNNET have the
	line: "pseudo-device	bbnnet".
	% config NETINET
	Don't forget to run "make depend".
	% config BBNNET
	Don't forget to run "make depend".
	% cd ../NETINET
	% make depend
	% make links
	% cd ../BBNNET
	% make depend
	% make links
	% make vmunix
	<Works fine.>
	% cd ../NETINET
	% make vmunix
	<Comes up with "Undefined:">
Fix:
	Put the line "#ifdef BBNNET" at the start and the line
	"#endif BBNNET" at the end of /sys/bbnnet/udp_usrreq.c
	(It might be a good idea to do the equivalent to
	../netinet/udp_usrreq.c.)
