Subject: panic: Protection fault
Index: sys/netinet/if_ether.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When the kernel has filled a specific arptab bucket up with
	plain old vanilla entries ( ARPTAB_BSIZ of them ), and then attempts
	to add one more it will panic.

Repeat-By:
	You could make sure you have ARPTAB_BSIZ+1 hosts on an ethernet which
	hash to the same bucket, and then ping each one once.  You
	will see the following on the console:

		trap type 9, code = c, pc = 80002c45
		panic: Protection fault
		syncing disks...  ...

Fix:
	The fix is simple; type the unsigned char at line 436 plus or
	minus N of if_ether.c.
	The subroutine arptnew does an unsigned logical comparison
	between a small integer and a really large one
	(0xffffffff on a 32 bit machine) on the assumption that it is
	doing a signed comparison between a small integer and -1.  See
	Appendix A, section 6.6 of "The C Programming Language" by
	Kernighan and Ritchie.
	I wonder if there are anymore of these out there.
