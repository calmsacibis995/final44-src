Subject: Bug in 4.3BSD network code.  +FIX
Summary: A naive or malicious user can crash your 4.3BSD machine.
Index: sys/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c 4.3BSD

Repeat By:

( Since *any* user can execute the code, and since it will crash
  your 4.3BSD machine, I sent it, and a kernel stack trace, to
  the security mailing list.  Look for it there. )

Description:

In routine tcp_ctloutput(), under certain conditions, an attempt is made
to free an mbuf when, in fact, it's really trying to free a NULL pointer.
As a result, Vaxen crash with a `Protection Fault' -- I assume that other
4.3 machines would be equally unhappy.

Fix:

Obviously, check for the NULL pointer before trying to free the mbuf.
Apply the following patch to "sys/netinet/tcp_usrreq.c".
