Subject: tty.h uses struct winsize, but doesn't include ioctl.h
Index: 	sys/h/tty.h, 4.3BSD

Description:
	/sys/h/tty.h uses the winsize structure, but doesn't include
	/sys/h/ioctl.h to get the definition. With the new "multiple include"
	flavor of include files, this doesn't need to happen.

Repeat-By:
	Try compiling something that uses tty.h, but not ioctl.h (I can
	loan you a copy of ct.c :-).
Fix:
	Put the requisite include statements into /sys/h/tty.h.
