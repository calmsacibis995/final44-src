Subject: ad.c doesn't compile (A/D converter using DEC protocols)
Index: sys/vaxuba/ad.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Simple: /sys/vaxuba/ad.c as distributed won't compile because a
	header file wasn't included and two typos weren't corrected.
Repeat-By:
	Include the line:
		device ad0 at uba? csr 0170400 vectro adintr
	
	in your configuration file and 'make'.
Fix:

	Obviously, either this driver hasn't gotten heavy use and/or the
fixes are so simple that nobody bothered to report them.  In any event,
they're still in the 4.3 distribution, only this time they have a nice
copyright header.  I only included the driver because I foresee using it
in the future on a 750.

To anyone has actually *used* this driver: Please report any additional bugs,
if any.  I'll do the same if/when I find them.

Conxtext diff using the 4.3bsd source follows:
