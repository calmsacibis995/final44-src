Subject:  bug fix to autoconf.c
Index: sys/machine/autoconf.c 4.3BSD

We applied the following fix to /usr/src/sys/vax/autoconf.c so
that controllers would be marked as in use at boot time and it
would be  possible to use wild cards in the conf file.

from a diff of:
/usr/src/sys/vax/autoconf.c.old
/usr/src/sys/vax/autoconf.c.new
