Subject: Ecc errors on a rb drive on an 11/730 hang the system
Index: 	sys/vaxuba/idc.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When the idc driver gets an ecc (recoverable) error, it calls
	idcecc() which prints "idcecc: HELP!\n", and then hangs the system.
Repeat-By:
	Get an rb disk on an 11/730 with an ecc error, and read the file
	that contains the block with the error.
Fix:
	------- idc.c -------
	705d704
	< 	printf("idcecc: HELP!\n");
	723c722
	< 		addr = ptob(ubp->uba_map[reg+btop(byte)].pg_pfnum)+
	---
	> 		addr = ptob(*(int *)&ubp->uba_map[reg+btop(byte)]&0x1fffff)+
	The problem here is that the bit field causes a extzv instruction,
	and the mask generates a bicl3 instruction.
