Subject: tcp FIN retransmission garbaged; Possible Bug in 4.3 BSD TCP?
Date: Tue, 23 Jun 87 17:50:09 -0700


Index:	sys/netinet/tcp_output.c 4.3BSD

Description:

Situation: VAX-11/750 running 4.3 BSD UNIX (with all official Berkeley fixes
applied) and a workstation with a dumb unbuffered ethernet interface. Our
version of tcp_output.c is 7.2.1.1 (Berkeley) 3/28/87.

Observed Problem: A FIN is properly sent by the VAX to the workstation. The FIN
is not received by the workstation (not seen). When the FIN is retransmitted by
the VAX, it is bogus: the sequence number is decremented by one, the urgent bit
is set, and the urgent pointer is set to one. This and all subsequent
retransmissions of this FIN by the VAX have this same identical damage. The
workstation never ACKs the damaged FIN and never sees the FIN it is expecting;
we hang in this state indefinately.

There is code in the tcp_output.c module to handle retransmission of FINs. It
advances the sequence number at first, and then if resending a FIN, it backs
the sequence number off. Further code to set the urgent bit exists if sequence
numbers appear damaged. This code appears damaged in an obvious way which makes
me suspect it is broken in a real non obvious way.

Repeat-By:

Have a system ignore a valid FIN from a 4.3 BSD system and see what happens to the FIN upon retransmission.
