Subject: pagein() underflushes buffer cache in some cases
Index: 	sys/sys/vm_page.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: hplabs!4bsd-bugs@berkeley.edu

Description:
	the code to flush the buffer cache before paging in from
	the inode only flushes the first CLSIZE pages from the buffer
	cache.  this is underflushing for klsize greater than one.
Repeat-By:
	a sync()'ing daemon may mask the bug.  try compiling
	something and then running it on a quiet system.
	pages klustered in from the inode may be stale.
Fix:
