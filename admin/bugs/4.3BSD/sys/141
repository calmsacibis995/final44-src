Subject: possible problem with process table
Index: sys/sys/kern_proc.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	As I understood it, procNPROC points to *after* the last valid
	process table entry, but here *procNPROC is being treated as a
	valid process slot . . . ( /sys/sys/kern_proc.c, line 107 )

	/*
	 * most procs are initially on freequeue
	 *	nb: we place them there in their "natural" order.
	 */

	freeproc = NULL;
!	for (p = procNPROC; --p > proc; freeproc = p)
		p->p_nxt = freeproc;

Repeat-By:

Fix:

	/*
	 * most procs are initially on freequeue
	 *	nb: we place them there in their "natural" order.
	 */

	freeproc = NULL;
!	for (p = procNPROC - 1; --p > proc; freeproc = p)
		p->p_nxt = freeproc;
