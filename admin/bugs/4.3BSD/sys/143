Subject: early ka630 panic causes trap (`for the record')

Index: sys/vax/ka630.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Since cldevice is mapped by clockmap in the KA630 todr init
	code, if the kernel panics before initialising the todr, it
	panics again on the way down, trying to store the todr.

Repeat-by:
	Work up a `panic: iinit' somehow, or just insert a panic in
	before the call to inittodr().

Fix:
	I did mine on the 8200, after changing the clock code
	substantially.  I will put the new stuff on okeeffe once I am
	sure it works on the cpu's I can test here.  Just for the
	record, What I did was add this:

	/* store time into clock */
	ka8200_clkwrite()
	{
		struct chiptime c;
		int s;

/*new*/		if (!Clockmap[0].pg_v)	/* never managed to read it */
/*new*/			return;

		timetochip(&c);
