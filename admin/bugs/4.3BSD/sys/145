Subject: exec (really vinifod) can scribble random kernel data
Index: sys/kern_exec.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	vinifod (in vm_subr.c) is called with a pointer to pte's.  vinifod
	calls bmap, which can sleep.  While the process is sleeping in bmap,
	it can be swapped out.  When it is swapped back in, the pte's can
	be allocated at a different kernel virtual address.  vinifod will
	then use the old pte address and scribble on random kernel data.
Repeat-By:
	Lotsa luck.  While debugging new hardware we had just the right
	combination of events to make this occur repeatably.  I wouldn't
	expect it to occur very often in general.
Fix:
	The quick fix is to prevent the process from being swapped during the
	time the pte's are being initialized.  (Sorry I don't have better
	diff's or something.)

	In kern_exec.c, change line 453 to

		u.u_procp->p_flag |= pagi | SKEEP;

	After line 469 (after the call to vinifod) add:

		u.u_procp->p_flag &= ~SKEEP;
