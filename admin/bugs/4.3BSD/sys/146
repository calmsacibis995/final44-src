Subject: Spurious "done" interrupt after autoconfigure of TU78
Index: sys/vaxmba/mt.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The autoconfigure code for the TU78 tape device driver sometimes
	causes an unsolicited "done" interrupt - harmless, but annoying.
Repeat-By:
	Try it on a processor faster than a VAX 11/785.
Fix:
	The following is my best guess - increasing the delay time seems
	to help:

*** /source/sys/vaxmba/mt.c	Thu Jun  5 04:32:57 1986
--- /sys/vaxmba/mt.c	Tue Aug 11 14:50:13 1987

*** 154,160 ****
  	/* Cancel the interrupt, then wait a little while for it to go away. */
  
  	mtaddr->mtas = mtaddr->mtas;
! 	DELAY(10);
  	splx(s);
  	return (rtn);
  }
