Subject: TCP sequence number bug

Index: sys/netinet/tcp_input.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	TCP connections to some non-BSD systems open, but will not
	accept data from the remote system.

	The "advertised window", tcp_adv, was not initialized during
	connection synchronization.  Also, one comparison on sequence
	numbers was made incorrectly, using a difference of unsigned 
	values, which in C is always positive(!).

					John Nagle

Repeat-By:
	Try to establish a TCP connection with a system which sets
	the high bit in the TCP sequence number.  (A 4.3BSD system
	which has been up for more than 195 days will do this, or
	you can change the initial value of tcp_iss to some value
	with the high bit set.)


Fix:
