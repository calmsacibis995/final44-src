Subject: /usr/adm/weekly su's to "nobody", but nobody doesn't have a shell
Index: sys/dist/passwd 4.3BSD

Description:
	The shell script /usr/adm/weekly su's to the uid "nobody" to rebuild
	the find database, but the /etc/passwd line for nobody distributed with
	the system has /dev/null listed as the user nobody's shell.  Su doesn't
	like that ...
Repeat-By:
	Look at the mail that the weekly script produces.  It includes the
	message "No shell" (produced by su) right after the message saying
	it's about to rebuild the find database.
Fix:
	Change /dev/null to /bin/sh.
