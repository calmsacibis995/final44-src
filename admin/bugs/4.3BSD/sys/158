Subject: Patch to 4.3BSD boot for Rev. 8 11/750s
Index: sys/vaxstand/boot.c 4.3BSD

For those of you with 11/750s still on DEC hardware maintenance, your
friendly Field Service person should be installing a FCO bringing the CPU
up to revision 8.  The FCO changes all the boot ROMs so that the very
first thing that happens on any boot is that the TU58 is read looking for
PCSLOAD.EXE and PCS750.BIN, then microcode is updated and then the normal
device specific boot code is executed.  Fortunately, if the tape isn't there
or these files aren't on the tape, the boot will continue.  Another "feature"
of the FCO is the loss of one of the four available boot devices.

If you do take advantage of this FCO and leave a TU58 cartridge in the
machine (and the price you pay is a LONG wait before the normal boot
begins), the boot program for 4.3BSD needs to be modified to not immediately
load an older version of the microcode over the version read from the TU58.
The version of pcs750.bin present in 4.3BSD's /pcs750.bin is 98, the version
distributed with the revision 8 FCO is version 99.

The patch to sys/stand/boot.c listed below will list the microcode version
(and for fun, the hardware version) and will load /pcs750.bin if needed.
