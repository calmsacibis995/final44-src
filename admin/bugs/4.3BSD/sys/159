Subject: there is a race condition in getnewbuf
Index: sys/ufs_bio.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If getnewbuf sleeps on a request for the same blockno twice,
	there is a race condition.
Repeat-By:
	Code examination.
Fix:
	Possible fix is to do the blockno search currently done
	in getblk() in getnewbuf(), and have the three routines
	that call getnewbuf() specify if they want that search done.
	Then, the sleep can loop around the search.
