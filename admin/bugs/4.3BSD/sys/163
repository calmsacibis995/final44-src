Subject: multiple tape slaves autoprobe to same slave device number
Index: sys/vax/autoconf.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	mbafind() in autoconf.c will iterate once over mbsinit for every
	slave found in order to find unattached slaves.  Any slave matching
	the drive type and slave number criteria (which can be wildcarded)
	will be attached.  However there is no break in the for loop when
	a match is found, therefore EVERY slave drive entry matching the
	criteria is attached to the current slave number.

Repeat-By:
	When configured as follows:

	controller	mba1	at nexus ?
	master		 ht0	at mba1 drive ?
	master		 ht1	at mba1 drive ?
	tape		  tu0	at ht? slave ?
	tape		  tu1	at ht? slave ?

	And with two slave drives attached to one formatter, the following
	is observed at boot time:

	ht0 at mba1 drive 0
	tu0 at ht0 slave 0
	tu1 at ht0 slave 0

Fix:
	Break the for loop when one drive is found which matches:
