Subject: deuna fix + 2361 info
Index: sys/vaxif/if_de.c 4.3BSD

attached is a bug fix i found by doing a grep on some old
network news (i don't normally read it). the fix goes in
the deuna driver at the end of the destart() function, and
kicks the interface if the transmit queue backs up. the
number of transmit buffers is also increased.
