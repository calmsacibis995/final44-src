Subject: ts11 reset code is wrong

Index: sys/vaxuba/sys.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	tsreset() assumes that the system configuration file
	is correct.  If it is not, tsdinfo and tsminfo will not
	be in 1-to-1 correspondence and a reset on a running
	system will lock up the 2nd tape drive, assuming multiple
	slaves were configured on the first.

Repeat-by:
	Ha.

	This report is just for completeness.
	I fixed it even though this costs code (who cares
	about time in Unibus reset handlers?)
