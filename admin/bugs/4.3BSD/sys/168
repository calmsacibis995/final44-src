Subject: Random u.u_errno value when using closing pty master.
Index: sys 4.3BSD

Description:
	The function closei() expects a return value from the close
	functions in cdevsw[].  The function ptcclose has no explicit
	return value.  The random return value from ptcclose is assigned
	to u.u_errno.  If this value is non-zero, your system call
	returns a meaningless error such as EPERM.
Repeat-By:
	Stochastic problem, can't necessarily repeat with any given piece
	of code.  Open a pseudo-terminal master, then close it.  You may
	or may not get an error return value from the close().
Fix:
	Make ptcclose() return either 0 if you believe that it can't
	have any E* errors, or else return the current value of u.u_errno.
