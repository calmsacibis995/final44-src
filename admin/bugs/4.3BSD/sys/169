Subject: dz driver in MDMBUF mode will never restart
Index: sys/vaxuba/dz.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The way I read the code, if the carrier drops on a line in
	MDMBUF mode, the ttymodem() routine will call dzstop.  When
	the carrier comes back, since TS_CARR_ON will still be
	set, dzscan() will not call ttymodem again and the line
	will remain stopped.

Repeat-by:
	It should manifest if you attach a line to a DZ, stty mdmbuf,
	then drop and raise carrier while catting a big file.  I have
	not tried it myself.

Fix:
	dzscan and dzrint should call linesw[tp->t_line].l_modem
	even if TS_CARR_ON, and then this routine should read at
	the bottom

	else if ((tp->t_state & TS_CARR_ON) == 0) {
		tp->t_state |= TS_CARR_ON;
		wakeup(...);
	}

	instead of just

	else {
		tp->t_state |= TS_CARR_ON;
		wakeup(...);
	}

	so as to avoid lots of wakeup()s.

Chris
