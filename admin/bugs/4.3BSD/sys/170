Subject: MUNLOCK() and MLOCK() macros have argument problems
Index: 	sys/h/vmmac.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MUNLOCK() macro has the classic missing-parentheses
	problem.  Also, both MLOCK() and MUNLOCK() evaluate their
	arguments more than once, when there is no need at all for them
	to do so, since each is already a compound statement and can
	contain declarations.

Repeat-By:
	Try MUNLOCK(&cmap[...]);
	Try MUNLOCK(*cmapptr++); or MLOCK(*cmapptr++);

Fix:
	Change the macros to:

	#define MLOCK(arg) { register struct cmap *c;	\
		c = (arg);				\
		while (c->c_lock) {			\
			c->c_want = 1;			\
			sleep((caddr_t)c,PSWP+1);	\
		}					\
		c->c_lock = 1;				\
	}

	and

	#define MUNLOCK(arg) { register struct cmap *c;	\
		c = (arg);				\
		if (c->c_want) {			\
			wakeup((caddr_t)c);		\
			c->c_want = 0;			\
		}					\
		c->c_lock = 0;				\
	}

Subject: my bugfix to sys/h/vmmac.h....

....submitted just a few hours ago.  *blush* I slipped up.  And I
slipped up again when I sent in a bug report with an untested fix.

The internal variable created in the macros must have a distinctive
name, different from any argument the macro is ever called with.  As in
(and *this* one *is* tested)

	/*
	 * Lock a page frame.
	 */
	#define MLOCK(arg) { register struct cmap *_c_MLOCK;		\
		_c_MLOCK = (arg);					\
		while (_c_MLOCK->c_lock) {				\
			_c_MLOCK->c_want = 1;				\
			sleep((caddr_t)_c_MLOCK,PSWP+1);		\
		}							\
		_c_MLOCK->c_lock = 1;					\
	}
	/*
	 * Unlock a page frame.
	 */
	#define MUNLOCK(arg) { register struct cmap *_c_MUNLOCK;	\
		_c_MUNLOCK = (arg);					\
		if (_c_MUNLOCK->c_want) {				\
			wakeup((caddr_t)_c_MUNLOCK);			\
			_c_MUNLOCK->c_want = 0;				\
		}							\
		_c_MUNLOCK->c_lock = 0;					\
	}
