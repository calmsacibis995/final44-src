Subject: correction to bugreport dealing with mbuf.h and cltom()
Index: sys 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	In the "Fix" description, I wrote that I removed the #defines
	and #ifdefs where MCL... is forced to be the same as CL...
	Replace "same as" with "different from".
