Subject: dma tty drivers could hog uba maps

Index: sys/vaxuba/{dh,dhu,dmf,dmz}.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If dhopen decides to allocate some space, and goes to sleep
	in uballoc, and then dmfopen decides to allocate some space,
	they will both end up allocating space; one of those spaces
	will be forgotten, never to be seen again.  If the two (or
	more) simultaneous allocations occur in the same driver, a
	unibus reset will correct things.

Repeat-by:
	Examination.  Fortunately, this never happens.


	Fixing this is ugly.
