SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:
if uid is 65536, user is logged in as root

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	setreuid()

BUG PORTED TO UTX?
	yes and to Secure UNIX

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	i created a user in /etc/passwd with uid = 65536 and when
	i logged into the system i was 'root'.
	tim tucker explained the following:
		the password file uid is an int.
		the user structure u_uid and u_ruid are shorts.
		in setreuid() 
			u.u_ruid = ruid;
			u.u_uid = euid;	
		the top 16 bits of the int ruid and euid are ignored
		so that u.u_ruid and u.u_uid become 0.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
	setreuid()
	{
		struct a {
			int	ruid;
			int	euid;
		} *uap;
		register int ruid, euid;
	
		uap = (struct a *)u.u_ap;
		ruid = uap->ruid;
		if (ruid == -1)
			ruid = u.u_ruid;
		if (u.u_ruid != ruid && u.u_uid != ruid && !suser())
			return;
		euid = uap->euid;
		if (euid == -1)
			euid = u.u_uid;
		if (u.u_ruid != euid && u.u_uid != euid && !suser())
			return;
		/*
		 * Everything's okay, do it.
		 */
	#ifdef QUOTA

		if (u.u_quota->q_uid != ruid) {
			qclean();
			qstart(getquota(ruid, 0, 0));
		}
	#endif
		u.u_procp->p_uid = ruid;
		u.u_ruid = ruid;
		u.u_uid = euid;
	}

SUGGESTED FIX:
	the uids should be ints or shorts.

In 4.3, uids and gids have their own typedefs (uid_t and gid_t) in
<sys/types.h>. Anything manipulating uids or gids should use those types.
