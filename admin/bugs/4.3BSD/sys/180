Subject: Incorrect DHU register assignment (+ FIX)
Index: sys/vaxuba/dhureg.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	I believe that the DHU register assignment for CTS (Clear to send)
	may be incorrect. Upon examination of the "DHU11 Interface
	User's Guide" on the section on Line Status Register, it is
	indeed apparant that the value for DHU_ST_CTS should be 0x08
	rather than 0x04 as published in 4.3BSD.

	We recently had to fix flow control on our modems and the patch
	below seemed to solve our problems. It turned out that we had
	the correct fix to the problem all along but we were examining
	the wrong bits in the status register (GAK!!).

Could someone kindly verify that the following fix is indeed
consistent with the hardware (+ documentation).
