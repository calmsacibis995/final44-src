Subject: Enhancement: use '/' as a word erase (^W) delimiter
Index: 	sys/sys/tty.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Suggestion for enhancement: Add the '/' character to the list of
	delimiters used by the tty driver in handling word erase (^W).
	This is nice when you have a long path typed out and need to
	backspace a few elements of that path.  Right now, you either wipe
	out the entire "word", or use the erase character to backspace one
	character at a time.

Repeat-By:
	Just type "/usr/stc/ucb/Mail" and then notice that you mistyped
	"src".  Type your word erase character and see the whole thing go
	away.

Fix:
	If you haven't done this already, a one line fix in the tty driver:
