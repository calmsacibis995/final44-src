Subject: interferance with LCASE and PRTERA
Index: 	sys/tty.c  4.3BSD

Description:
	When LCASE and PRTERA are both set (which *IS* a reasonable
	combination) an attempt to erase upper case letters causes a
	*BIG* mess on your display.  Eg: Typing \A gives \\\/\A  (\ that
	you typed; \\/ to "erase" the typed \ and finally \A to echo
	whats represented by what you typed.  This is a real, ugly mess,
	and is something that was *ADDED* with 4.3.

Repeat-By:
	stty lcase prterase
	then type \A   (or any letter)

Fix:
		(in 4 parts)
	1:  Arount line 750 there is a new block that starts with:
	if (...LCASE && c <= 0177)
	Change the "ttyrub(unputc...." to just "unputc..."

	2: Now we have to NOT echo the \ only when ttyoutput is called from
	ttyecho (but not from other places) so:
	gaurd the ttyoutput at the end of ttyecho (about line 1536) with:
		tp->t_state |= TS_ECHO;
		ttyoutput...
		tp->t_state &= ~TS_ECHO;

	3: In ttyoutput: block starting with "if (tp->t_flags&LCASE) {"  
						(about lines 945-960)
	garud the two lines that have "ttyoutput ('\\', tp)" with
	checks to skip if TS_ECHO is set.

	4: Finally, define TS_ECHO in h/tty.h.

Disclamer:
	I'm using a 4.2 as a development system to convert 4.3 for our 
	project.  (We have both sourses, but ar not yet running 4.3) I have
	seen this bug on a 4.3 system at the Univesity of Wisconsin, Madison.
	Since my code does not run in the kernel, like the VAX suff, I cannot
	properly test my fix.  It seems to works in my environment, but 
	some of that is being simulated, so I provide no warrentees etc.
