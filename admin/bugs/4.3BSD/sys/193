Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) can't boot on VAXen with "hp" drives
#Index: sys/vax/autoconf.c MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87)
Index: sys/vax/autoconf.c 4.3BSD

[This may have already been reported and/or fixed;
this report is just to make sure it doesn't fall through the cracks.]

Description:
	When bootstrapping a kernel built from the 10/5/87 maintenance
	release, things will hang after the system prints
		
		hp0:

Repeat-By:
	Find a VAX with hp drives, build a kernel, and boot.

Analysis:
	The maintenance release contains new code to read partition
	information from disk drives.  This is done at configuration
	time, but using the "normal" device driver stuff.  The problem is that
	Massbus interrupts aren't enabled before the individual drives
	are queried, so completion of the disk operations to read the pack
	labels never caused interrupts and thus were never sensed by the
	computer.

Fix:
	There's almost surely a better fix, since there's almost surely a
	good reason that up to now the system waited until attaches were
	complete before enabling interrupts.  But this works for us.
