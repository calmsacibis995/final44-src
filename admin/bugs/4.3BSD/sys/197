Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) /sys/h/param.h comment doesn't match reality
#Index: /sys/h/param.h MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: sys/h/param.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	The file /sys/h/param.h contains this comment:

		Block devices are read in BLKDEV_IOSIZE units. This number must
		be a power of two and in the range of
			DEV_BSIZE <= BLKDEV_IOSIZE <= MAXBSIZE
		This size has no effect upon the file system, but is usually set
		to the block size of the root file system, so as to maximize the
		speed of ``fsck''.

	but also contains this define:

		#define BLKDEV_IOSIZE	2048

	when, in fact, the block size of the root file system is 8192, not 2048.
	If the comment is true, this impacts the performance of fsck;
	it also means that writes to pipes done by the standard io package are
	done in blocks of 2048 characters, rather than in (presumably better)
	8192 character blocks.

Repeat-By:
		Script started on Sat Aug 22 16:58:00 1987
		$ cat try.c
		#include "stdio.h"

		main(argc, argv)
		char *	argv[];
		{
			(void) putchar('\n');
			(void) printf("%d\n", _iob[1]._bufsiz);
		}
		$ cc try.c
		$ a.out

		8192
		$ a.out | cat

		2048
		$ exit

		script done on Sat Aug 22 16:58:25 1987

Fix:
	Either remove the comment from /sys/h/param.h or (preferably?)
	increase BLKDEV_IOSIZE to 8192.

No response on it yet from Mt. Xinu; I'm awaiting one before trying a rebuild.

I'd like to rebuild things--I had a program that failed when run this way:
	cat filename | failingprogram
but worked when run this way:
	failingprogram < filename
The bug turned out to only manifest itself when the standard input was being
read in the 2048-byte chunks that stdio uses when reading piped input on a
system with BLDEV_IOSIZE set to 2048; since there's no way I know of (yet :-)
to tell dbx to do piped input (or output), I had to recompile the program with
a "destandardized" standard I/O package in order to debug it.  This worked, of
course, but was a nuisance to do--and wouldn't have been possible if we were
a binary-only site.
