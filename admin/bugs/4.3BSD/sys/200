Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 write(2)s to block devices mess up on big writes past end
Index: sys 4.3BSD

Description:
	Large write(2)s to MORE/bsd 4.3 block device files
	("/dev/hp0a" and friends) return values indicating that the writes have
	succeeded, even when an attempt is made to write to an area beyond
	the end of the file.

Repeat-By:
	"Now viewers--we urge you *not* to try to do this at home!"
	Since /dev/hp1a is just a backup of /dev/hp0a on our system,
	I made use of it for the test below.  If you want to run this
	test on your own system, you'll need to find an unused partition--
	don't blindly use /dev/hp1a.

	Note the difference in the results from writing to /dev/rhp1a and
	/dev/hp1a.
