SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	Illegal instruction signal for segmentation fault?

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.1
Patch Level:  		C
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080

MODULE NAME:

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	Wouldn't it make more sense for a write into text space to 
	signal a segmentation fault?  Right now it signals an illegal
	instruction.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

Run this:

main()
{
    int *adr;

    adr = 0x206000;	/* Or whatever is the start of text on your system.
*/

    *adr = 5;
}
