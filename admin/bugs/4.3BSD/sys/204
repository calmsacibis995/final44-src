MODULE NAME:
socketpair system call

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
According to the man page, socketpair will  work for both SOCK_STREAM
and SOCK_DGRAM types. Yes, it will work, it will even return two
new socket descriptors. But the problem is, you can never send
data across to each other if SOCK_DGRAM is specified when the
socketpair system call was made, errno 39 (EDESTADDRREQ) will be
returned. The reason for this error to be returned is these
sockets were never set to be connected.

If you look at the code of the uipc_usrreq.c, under case PRU_CONNECT2,
things are not set up correctly if the socket type is for datagram.
So, when a send is issued, it checks to see if the state of the
socket is connected, ....
Anyway, we should either disallow socketpair
for SOCK_DGRAM or change the code in uipc_usrreq.c to make this
work.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Try to run the following program.

/* To test socketpair system call */
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

#define BUFSIZ 1024

/*============================================================================*/

extern int errno;

main()
{
        int     i,s;
        int     iws;
        int     sv[2];
        char    pwbuf[1024];
        char    prbuf[1024];
        struct sockaddr recvAddress;

        for (iws = 0; iws < BUFSIZ; iws++)
	{
                pwbuf[iws] = 'A' + iws%26;
        }
        pwbuf[BUFSIZ - 1] = '\0';

        if ((s = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0, sv)) < 0) 
	{
		printf("socketpair failed\n");
        }

        if ((i = send(sv[0], pwbuf, iws, 0)) != iws)
	{
                printf("#bytes written on sv[0] is %d\n", i);
		printf("errno %d received on the send call\n", errno);
        }

        if ((i = recv(sv[1], prbuf, iws, 0)) != iws)
	{
                printf("#bytes read from sv[1] is %d \n", i);
		printf("errno %d received from recv call\n", errno);
        }

        if ((i = strcmp(pwbuf,prbuf)) != 0)
	{
                printf("The received and sent messages differ\n");
        }

        close(sv[0]);
        close(sv[1]);
}
