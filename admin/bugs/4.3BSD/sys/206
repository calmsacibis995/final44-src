MODULE NAME:
	bind (2)

TYPE:
	software and documentation

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
I found these bugs while being a tester on Secure UNIX.

1.	The manpage says:
		When using sockets in the secure domain, the structure 
		secure_user_info is used instead of sockaddr.
		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	'secure_user_info' should be changed to 'sockaddr_secure'.

2.	also under ERRORS the manpage says:
		EACCESS 
	which should be changed to 'EACCES' (one 'S') except
	that EPERM is returned, not EACCES from secp_bind() so
	EACCES should be changed to EPERM on the manpage anyway.
		secp_bind():
			if ( !suser() )
			{
				return (EPERM);
			}

3.	nowhere in the source for bind (2) routines is errno EADDRNOTAVAIL 
	ever returned and so should be eliminated from manpage.

4.	the manpage says for errno EINVAL:
		22 EINVAL 	The socket is already bound to an address.
	but sockargs() says:
		if (namelen > MLEN)
			return (EINVAL);
	MLEN in mbuf.h is the mbuf data length and so the manpage doesn't
	seem to fit the code and we already have EADDRINUSE to cover that
	particular error.  maybe it should say:
		22 EINVAL	namelen greater than maximun mbuf data length

5.	ENOBUFS should be listed on manpage because it is a possible 
	error from sockargs():
		m = mget(M_WAIT, MT_SONAME);
		if (m == NULL)
			return(ENOBUFS);
