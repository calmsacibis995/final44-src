SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	syscall() doesn't check arg pointer

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.3 (and probably all other releases)
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	syscall(), in trap.c, in kernel

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)
	Software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)
	1  (I can panic your system any time I want to)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	Apparently in the interest of speed, syscall() does not check
	that the argument pointer is legal.  It just goes out to the
	address pointed to by B2 and copies in the arguments.  If the
	B2 happens to not be word aligned, or if it points out to some
	high address beyond the end of the process, the kernel will get
	a nasty trap, and will panic.

	(I've been nice, and haven't actually tried this.  If it turns
	out that there is some check somewhere that I have missed, I
	take it all back.  However, Paul Jones agrees that there is a
	problem.)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
	Panic

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
	Left as an exercise for the reader.  (I will supply an example
	on request.)

SUGGESTED FIX:
	Use copyin() to get the arguments, or at least check for
	alignment and legal range.

Yup, it sure crashes fast.
