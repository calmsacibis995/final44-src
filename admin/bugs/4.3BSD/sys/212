SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	SELECT and ^Z oddity.

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500

MODULE NAME:

BUG PORTED TO UTX?
	Yes.

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
I don't know if this is a bug, since it happens on the VAX, Fang, and 
Mycroft.  But I'd be interested in what's going on.

main()
{
char foo[100];
int nfound, readfids, writefids, exceptfids;

    while (1)
    {
        readfids = 1;        writefids = 0;        exceptfids = 0;
	printf("Entering select.\n");
	nfound = select(32, &readfids, &writefids, &exceptfids, 0);
	printf("Leaving select.\n");
	read(0, foo, 100);
	printf("%s", foo);
    }
}

It seems that it ought to behave just like a program without the select.
Not so:  if you type ^Z during the select, the process goes away!

Nor am I sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I would appreciate having
the correct behaviour of select properly explained - I have it on my list of
things almost certain to be broken by any messing with the scheduler, mainly
because I'm not exactly sure of everything it does.
