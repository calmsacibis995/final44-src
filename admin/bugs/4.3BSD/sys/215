Subject: bogus ICMP Port Unreachable
Index: sys/netinet/in.c 4.3BSD

Description:
        Given some valid network configurations, 4.3BSD incorrectly
        generates ICMP error messages in response to Ethernet broadcast
        packets, adding to the traffic on the local Ethernet and
        potentially causing serious collision problems.  Note that the
        problem is alleviated in the latest IP code (ucbarpa:
        4.3/in.tar, 7 Apr 1988 19:25) but not yet fixed.

        This is a manifestation of two more general problems:
        (1) a lack of clarity as to what the "broadcast address"
        (ia_broadaddr) settable for interfaces is supposed to mean.  I
        interpret it as the address that is to be used for outgoing IP
        broadcast traffic, but it is used in many places as the
        expected incoming broadcast address as well, blithely ignoring
        the fact that the IP RFCs mandate several different broadcast
        addresses.
        (2) the protocol layering that makes it difficult for IP-level
        code to be told if a packet arrived as a media broadcast.  Note
        that the IP RFCs (notably RFC 1009) require different treatment
        of packets that arrived as media broadcasts versus directed.

Repeat-By:
        Configure one 4.3BSD system as a TCP/IP host, and set the
        broadcast address on its interface (i.e. ia_broadaddr) to the
        network broadcast address; for example, assuming a class B
        network with 8-bit subnets, we might have host 128.32.130.111
        with a broadcast address of 128.32.255.255.  Alternatively, set
        its broadcast address to 255.255.255.255, the local broadcast
        address.  Configure a gateway with a broadcast address set to
        the default of the subnet broadcast address; for example,
        128.32.130.11 might have an interface configured with a
        broadcast address of 128.32.130.255.  Note that both are
        perfectly legal broadcast addresses (e.g., see RFC 1009).

        Now, run RIP (routed or gated) on the gateway, but not on the
        host.  The host will respond to every RIP packet with an "ICMP
        port unreachable" message.  If there are several hosts so
        configured, they are likely to generate Ethernet collisions as
        they all try to reply simultaneously.

Fix:
        Make in_broadcast() even more robust than it already is.
        Instead of just checking for a match of the destination address
        on incoming packets against ia_broadaddr, also check against
        the network broadcast address (and, perhaps, the subnet broadcast
        address):
Old:
                if (satosin(&ia->ia_broadaddr)->sin_addr.s_addr == in.s_addr)
                     return (1);
                if ((t = ntohl(in.s_addr)) == ia->ia_subnet || t == ia->ia_net)
                    return (1);
Suggested minimal new:
                if (satosin(&ia->ia_broadaddr)->sin_addr.s_addr == in.s_addr
                    || ia->ia_netbroadcast.s_addr == in.s_addr     /*+jqj*/
                    || (t = ntohl(in.s_addr)) == ia->ia_subnet
                    || t == ia->ia_net)
                     return (1);
Note that this still isn't adequate if the system administrator on the
host resets ia_broadaddr and the gateway uses the subnet broadcast address.
I would thus consider, though I don't recommend at this time, also adding
an explicit check against the subnet broadcast address, perhaps:
                    || htonl(ia->ia_subnet |
                             (INADDR_BROADCAST &~ ia->ia_subnetmask)) ==
                       in.s_addr
