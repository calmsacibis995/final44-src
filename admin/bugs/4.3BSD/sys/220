When I use open to create a file I sometimes would like to get an
exclusive lock on that file.  I have a program that needs to create
a file locked (basically).  As soon as the file is created other
process try to flock(2) it to update it.  (Befoe inited!)

something like

	fd = open(pchFile, O_CREAT|O_LOCK_EX|O_WRONLY, 0666);

would be what I really need here.  (Yeah I'd add
		O_LOCK_EX
		O_LOCK_SH
		O_LOCK_NB
but O_LOCK_UN means nothing.)

kayessbee, I man obsessed with file locking?  Maybe :-}.
