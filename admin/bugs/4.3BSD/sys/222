Sender: news@adm.ARPA
We're running 4.3bsd on a vax 780.  Recently we had a panic: ttyrub.
The tty was a pseudo tty and the panicky application was telnetd.
The user on that tty was dbx'ing a seeminly innocuous application.
The panic was due to apparently trying to rubout (in cooked mode)
a newline, but the rawq.cf didn't point to a newline, it pointed
to the start of the next line; ie, the previous char was a newline,
but had presumably already been processed.

Does this sound familiar?  Have we missed some bug fix?

Thanks,

The culprit appears to be a missing case statement in ttyrub(); we've
been running with this fix:

*** tty.c~	Thu Jun  5 03:09:35 1986
--- tty.c	Wed Jun 15 10:39:29 1988
***************
*** 1506,1511 ****
--- 1506,1512 ----
  		case BACKSPACE:
  		case CONTROL:
  		case RETURN:
+ 		case NEWLINE:
  			if (tp->t_flags&CTLECH)
  				ttyrubo(tp, 2);
  			break;
