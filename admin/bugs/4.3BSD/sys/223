Subject: Problems with ethernet (Interlan Np100 device)
Index: sys/vaxif/if_np.c,if_ix.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Our ethernet connection with an IBM 9370 regularly generates 
	ixrint errors.  The diagnostic printed on the console says:
	"ixrint: cqe error 1, 106, 0"
	We are certain that this is caused by the VAX as these errors
	also occur when the ethernet is disconnected from the IBM with
	the VAX running single user.

	The real problem is that from time to time it is impossible
	to work with the ethernet connection from the VAX-side.
	In those cases NO packets are put on the ethernet and an ftp
	call (VAX-side) hangs.
	If we then start ftp from the IBM-side the problem disappears.

Configuration:
	VAX11/750 with Interlan Np100 10 Mb/s Ethernet interface
	System BSD4.3.

	Our Interlan device is located at address 0162000.

	(In our configuration file:
	device		np0	at uba? csr 0162000		vector npintr

	Changes in if_np.c:
101c101
< u_short	npstd[] = { 0162000, 0162020, 0 };
---
> u_short	npstd[] = { 0166000, 0166020, 0 };
	)
