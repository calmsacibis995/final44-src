Subject: 3Com Ethernet controller goes deaf periodically
Index: sys 4.3BSD

Description:

	I am running 4.3bsd on a VAX 11/750 with a 3Com Ethernet
	controller.  Periodically, the operating system stops
	receiving packets.  It can still send packets, though.

	I've been told by the system administrator of another site,
	that they have had the same symptoms with a similar
	configuration under 4.2bsd.  Their problems occurred when the
	machine was in heavy use.  It is not in heavy use now, and the
	problem does not occur.  Their machine has 5Mb of memory.

	With 2Mb of memory in our machine, the problem did not seem to
	be occurring overly frequently.  When 1/4Mb of memory was
	removed for repair, the problem occurred with much greater
	frequency, perhaps every hour.  Putting the 1/4Mb of memory
	back in the machine has reduced the frequency of occurrences,
	but it is still a problem.
