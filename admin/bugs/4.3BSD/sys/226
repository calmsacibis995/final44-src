Sun-Software-Release-Number:
	SunOS 4.0 + "General-Hy patch"

Description:
	Both MORE/bsd 4.3 and SunOS 4.0 create world-readable core files,
	even if a user's umask is restrictive.  Even if the umask *isn't*
	restrictive, creating world-readable core files is arguably an
	error (although the protection glitch is pretty minor league).

	elsie$ exit

Fix:
	If SunOS 4.0 is enough like 4.3BSD, replace the line that sets the
	core file's mode to 0644 in the kernel's "core" function with a line
	that sets the mode to 0600.
