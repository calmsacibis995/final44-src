Subject: Mscp tape write fails or hangs intermittently on MicroVAX II
Index:  sys/vaxuba/tmscp.c 4.3BSD and Tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
        Mainly observed when an Exabyte tmscp tape was installed. The
        controller would fail on an invalid command after writing a few
        blocks. Also, intermittent system hang when copying between 9trk
        and TK50 tapes.
Repeat-By:
        Try running an Exabyte tmscp tape
Fix:
        Add entry for VAX_630 in cpu case statement that sets up "i" argument
        for ubasetup() call at line #XX in sys/vaxuba/tmscp.c

---------- Remove this line and what's below it. (only for reference) ------
