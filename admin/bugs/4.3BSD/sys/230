Subject: Intermittent write failures for tmscp on MicroVAX II
Index:  sys/vaxuba/tmscp.c 4.3BSD and Tahoe

Description:
        The Exabyte tmscp tape fails with an invalid command after writing
        a few blocks on a MicroVAX II. Also, system hangs intermittently
        when copying between 9trk. and TK50 tapes.
Repeat-By:
        Try writing to an Exabyte tape.
Fix:
        Add a "case VAX_630:" to the cpu switch in sys/vaxuba/tmscp.c that
        sets up the flag argument for ubasetup() as follows:
        *** Lines 1070 to 1085
        switch (cpu) {

        case VAX_8600:
        case VAX_780:
                i = UBA_NEEDBDP|UBA_CANTWAIT;
                break;
        case VAX_750:
                i = um->um_ubinfo|UBA_HAVEBDP|UBA_CANTWAIT;
                break;
        case VAX_730:
        case VAX_630:   /* ADDED for MicroVAX II */
                i = UBA_CANTWAIT;
                break;
        }   /* end switch (cpu) */
