I believe that bug fix V1.32 (splimp fix for microvaxes) is wrong.
(Though installing it probably will not break anything.)

From the KA630 manual (which is Copyright 1986 Digital Equipment Corporation):

	The Q22-Bus requests of levels 4 through 7 set IPL equal to 17,
	since the Q22-Bus has only one grant line.  The single grant does not
	differentiate between the different request levels and grants the
	first requesting  device it finds.  The IPL is et to 14 after a
	console terminal or interprocessor doorbell interrupt.  It is set to
	16 after an interval timer interrupt.


I believe that this means that even though the priority level of the
DEQNA is 0x14,  the processor sets itself to priority level 0x17 when
it services the interrupt.  Even though autoconfig and qeprobe might
make it look like the ipl is 0x17 for the DEQNA, you only need to go
to ipl 0x14 to lock out DEQNA interrupts.

I would be interested in hearing a reply from whoever decided that
V1.32 was necessary.  It is possible that I'm missing something.
