Subject: tty_pty.c possible bug
Index: sys/tty_pty.c 4.3BSD

In the copy of sys/tty_pty.c that I have (IBM ACIS 4.3) it appears that there
may be a bug small bug in ptcwrite().  In particular, set the control device to
PF_REMOTE and PF_NBIO at the same time.  I think this will cause iov to be
dereferenced before being set after the "goto block".
