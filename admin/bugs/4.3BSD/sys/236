Subject: Kernel makefile doesen't make depend for ioconf.c
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Index:	sys/conf/makefile.* 4.3BSD (and derivatives ?)

Description:
	The makefile in the system configuration directory doesn't include
	ioconf.c in the list of source files for which 
	dependencies should be made.

Repeat-By:
	Change a structure in ???var.h, 
	do not run config(8)
	make depend, 
	make, and try to reboot the resulting kernel.
	Watch strange things happen.

Fix:
	Add ioconf.c after ${CFILES} on the line below the "depend"
	entry in /sys/conf/makefile.*.
	Re-config all your kernels, re-make depend all your kernels.
	After this procedure is done, you won't be bitten by this
	bug anymore. A single "make" will do the right things when ???var.h
	is changed.
