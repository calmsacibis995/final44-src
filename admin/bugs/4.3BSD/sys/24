Subject: HDH problems with IMPMTU
Index: 	sys/vaxif/if_hdh.c 4.3BSD (& 4.2BSD)

Description: 
	A while back there was discussion about problems using IMPMTU-sized
	packets with LH/DH connections (if_acc.c).  The fix was to allocate
	extra room beyond the end of the packet by replacing occurences of
	IMPMTU by IMPMTU+2.  Well, the same applies to the HDH driver, but it
	was not fixed there.
Repeat-By:
	Try to talk to a site over an HDH connection using maximum-length IMP
	packets.  For instance, try to receive a file of length >1k bytes onto
	a local ethernet host from ucbarpa through a gateway using the hdh
	driver.  The TCP MSS calculations are such that IMPMTU will be used.
Fix: 
	Replace occurences of IMPMTU with IMPMTU+2 in sys/vaxif/if_acc.c
	(tested).
