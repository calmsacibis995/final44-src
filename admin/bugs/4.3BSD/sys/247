Description:
	Not a bug really.  More a request for information.

	Our system has a single RA81 as its only disk device.
	We have had a number of occurrences like the following recently.

		uda0: soft error, SDI error, unit 0, event 053, hdr 0x0
		 0x13 0x4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xa 0x0 0x6e 0x4 0xa 0x0 0x0
		uda0: hard error
		uda0: hard error, SDI error, unit 0, event 053, hdr 0x0
		 0x13 0x4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xa 0x0 0x6e 0x4 0xa 0x0 0x0
		ra0a: hard error sn80 OFFLINE

	The question is: What is "event 053"?

	I would be grateful for any assistance you can provide.
