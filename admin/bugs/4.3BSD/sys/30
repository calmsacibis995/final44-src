Subject:  brl-vgr Bug Report

Subject:  Warning to those who would change proc.h
Index:	sys/h/proc.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	Changing the length of the proc structure so that it is not
	double word aligned anymore will cause the system to crash
	in bizarre ways.
Repeat-By:
	Add a word to the proc structure and then put a load on the
	system.  Soon things like ps will stop working and then the
	whole machine will experience a strange trap.
Fix:
	1.  Don't change the proc structure.
	2.  If you do, pad it out to the next double word.
