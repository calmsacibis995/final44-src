Subject: Unable to set vv address on subnet
Index:	sys/vaxif/if_vv.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Ifconfig returns an error when you try to set the address on
	the proteon when using subneting.
Repeat-By:
	ifconfig vv0 128.63.4.3 netmask 255.255.255.0
Fix:
	The vv driver checks to see if the local net part of
	address corresponds to the hardware address of the interface
	installed in your system.  The subnet mask can not be set
	before the address because the mask has to be tied to a
	particular internet address.

	The fix is to make the vv driver mask off all but the lowest
	eight bits of the address before making the validity check.
	This is OK since the device can only deal with eight local
	address bits.  In vvioctl:

                /*
                 * Attempt to check agreement of protocol address
                 * and board address.
                 */
		switch (ifa->ifa_addr.sa_family) {
                case AF_INET:
			if ((in_lnaof(IA_SIN(ifa)->sin_addr) & 0xFF) !=
			    vv_softc[ifp->if_unit].vs_host)
				error = EADDRNOTAVAIL;
			break;
		}
		break;
