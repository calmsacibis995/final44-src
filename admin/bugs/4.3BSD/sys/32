Index:	sys/netinet/tcp_output.c 4.3BSD FIX

This is the first of a set of three bug reports with fixes for the network
in 4.3BSD.  All 4.3 sites should install the modifications described in
these reports.  The bug described in this report is the most serious,
as it can cause unnoticed loss of data.

Description:

The final change in the send code in TCP in 4.3 was made incorrectly.
In tcp_output (/sys/netinet/tcp_output.c), the output packet flags
are chosen before the packet length is adjusted to reflect the maximum
segment size.  Under some cirsumstances, this results in sending a FIN
with a packet which is not the last data packet.  This is most often
noticed when the connection implements a one-way transfer of data
and the sender closes while the data is still draining.

Fix:

Move the lines in tcp_output that look up the flags to be sent
to a location after the final length adjustment, as follows:
