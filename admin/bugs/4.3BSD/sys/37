the symptom was being flooded with syslog msgs from all over the network.

Subject: amusing but serious bug
Status: R

Mark, the egp you got from karels had a pretty nasty bug; it
advertised a route to net 127, the lookback address.  All those syslog
entries flooding in were coming from all over the internet (dec, cmu,
usc to name a few)!!

Actually, we got bit by that about a year ago, when someone else
advertised such a route.  I think it caused 4.2 sendmail to get
completely confused about something.  At that time, I put a fix into
egpup to ignore advertised routes for the loopback interface (and for
the "default" gateway).  I don't think that fix needs to be done now.

Anyway, the file init.c needed a change-of-constant to realize that the
net addresses are high-order justified.  Fixed, but you might want to tell
karels.

Amusing bug.  It is only manifested if the egp config file doesn't
define the list of net(s) to be advertised, which I can't imagine doing,
so we've never seen it.  The fix is definitely not the best one, though,
as I've strongly encouraged people to use a local address for the loopback.
There is a much better fix in the equivalent code from routed, which
I just installed here.

The code in my directory is as up-to-date as exists, but it runs
only on 4.3 (not 4.2).  I trust that whoever is using it runs 4.3.
