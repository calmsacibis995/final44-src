Subject: Hard links to directories corrupt filesystem

Index:	sys/sys/ufs_syscalls.c 4.3BSD [Fix]

Description:
	   Though the man entry for "ln" states that hard links to
	directories are not allowed, their creation may be forced.  If
	a hard link to a directory is created, the filesystem will
	become slightly corrupt and will need a fsck to repair the
	damage.

Repeat-By:
	   As root, do the following operations:
		# mkdir foo
		# mkdir bar
		# mkdir bar/baz
		# cd foo
		# ln -f ../bar/baz
	   As I said above, a fsck afterward is a good idea.

Fix:
	   Apply the following patch to the release version of ufs_syscalls.c.
	Alternatively, I would think that fsck could be changed so that it
	didn't gripe when it came across a hard link to a directory, but I
	felt that this was closer to the "right" thing to do.  The man
	entry for "link" should also be updated to state that this is
	illegal.
