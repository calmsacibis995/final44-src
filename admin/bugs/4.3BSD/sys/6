Subject: ttyflush can be made a bit faster, very easily...
Index: 	sys/tty.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The Subject just about says it all.
Repeat-By:
	Look at code in ttyflush, compare with suggested fix.
Fix:
	Replace each of the loops

		while (getc(&tp->t_XXX) >= 0)
			;

	with

		ndflush(&tp->t_XXX, tp->t_XXX.c_cc);

	2nd speedup, once this technique is used....

	In ndflush, recognise when the whole queue is being deleted,
	and do it faster.  Insert the following code after the
	(q->c_cc <= 0) test, and before the while loop:

	if (cc >= q->c_cc) {
		register struct cblock *np;

		np = bp = (struct cblock *)((int)q->c_cf & ~CROUND);
		while (np->c_next != NULL) {
			np = np->c_next;
			cfreecount += CBSIZE;
		}
		np->c_next = cfreelist;
		cfreelist = bp;
		cfreecount += CBSIZE;
		if (cwaiting) {
			wakeup(&cwaiting);
			cwaiting = 0;
		}
		q->c_cf = q->c_cl = NULL;
		q->c_cc = 0;
		goto out;
	}
