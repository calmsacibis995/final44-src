Subject: Interrupting signals not reset on exec (FIX)
Index: sys/sys/kern_exec.c 4.3BSD FIX

Description:
	In 4.3BSD, the ability to interrupt systemcalls is controlled
	on a per-signal basis through the user structure entry u.u_sigintr.
	Unfortunately, the bit is never reset.
	
Repeat-By:
	Run one of Doug Gwyn's system V shells compiled for 4.3BSD
	and watch the behavior of signals on editors or other other
	programs that have reads which should not be interrupted by signals.

Fix:
	In kern_exec.c, apply the following diff.  This will reset
	the sigintr behavior when it resets all the other signal
	parameters for the new process image.
