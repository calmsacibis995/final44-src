Subject: Too long packets on ethernet
Index:	sys/netinet/in.c 4.3BSD

Description:

Our problem was too long (>576 bytes) packets to nonlocal addresses.
Although the option SUBNETSARELOCAL = 0 was used, packets were still too
large causing our ARPA-gateway to crash.
	
Repeat-By:

The problem occured in the gateway.

Fix:
