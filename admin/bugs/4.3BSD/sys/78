"I think the best solution for your particular problem is to ask me
about the bug."

MC:	Welcome fans to another round of "Stump the Bostic".
	<Wild applause>
MC:	Our contestant today is Ron Stanonik from NPRDC.  Well, Ron
	do you feel ready?
	<Mild applause>
Ron:	Uh, yes, I think so.  Say, could I hello to my mother?
MC:	Sorry Ron, we gotta move along.
	<Laughter>
Ron:	Okay, here goes.  We're running 4.3bsd on a vax 780.
	Occasionally dh lines will hang.  The symptoms are that
	dtr is not asserted, /etc/ttys is okay, kill -1 1 has
	no effect, and toggling carrier has no effect (ie, turning the
	terminal off and on).  The latter implies that the line
	is no longer being watched for modem transitions.  Apparently
	there is a race between the last modem interrupt (when
	carrier drops) and the next open (from init).  The open
	sets dtr, but the carrier drop clears it.  Unfortunately,
	in the dh, the register containing the dtr bit also
	contains the sample-the-modem-lines bit.  I'm puzzled
	why this race occurs since the dtr fiddling code (dmctl)
	in the open is within an spl5.  At any rate, that's the
	problem.
MC:	Well audience, what do you think?
	<Mixture of boos and cheering>
MC:	Okay, Bostic, the clock is running.
