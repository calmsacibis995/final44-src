Subject: 4.3 won't autoconfigure _certain_ DEC RM03 drives properly
Index: sys/vax 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Synopsis:   VAX11/780 with DEC RM03 on mba0
config file:	controller mba0 at nexus ?
		disk hp0 at mba? drive 0

/sys/vaxmba/hp.c  7.1 (Berkeley) 6/5/86

We had to replace a defective RM03 - after DEC worked on for weeks and it
again caught fire they gave up and shipped out a new (refurbished) one.
The new one during autoconfiguration reports the drive type as 9775 (!)
and so is unusable.

I did a lot of poking around in code I don't understand and found that
hpmaptype() piddles with the drive serial number hpsn.  This seems to be
some kludge necessitated by S.I. controllers.  At any rate, the serial number
of the new drive is 8758.  We jumpered a couple of the bits to change it to
8458 or something like that, and then it worked OK.

I hope someone wiser than I will figure out whether the driver really is
weird, or do we have something else wrong in the hardware that causes the
real drive type to be overlooked and activates the S.I. kludge?
