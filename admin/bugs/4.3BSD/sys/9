Subject: /genvmunix won't boot with il0 at default address
Index: sys/conf/GENERIC 4.3BSD

Description:

/sys/conf/GENERIC has

device		en0	at uba0 csr 0161000 vector enxint enrint encollide

at the default CSR address for Interlan boards:

device		il0	at uba? csr 0161000 vector ilrint ilcint

This causes /genvmunix to die a nasty death during autoconfiguration
of a machine with il0 at the above address.  Apparently it notices
something is at that csr address and believes it is en0 until it
actually tries to do something with it.

Repeat-By:
	Try booting /genvmunix on a machine with an Interlan at the default csr.
Fix:
	a) Pull the Interlan board, boot /genvmunix, compile a new kernel.
		Recommended in the installation notes.
	b) Don't configure ethernet boards in the generic kernel.  Preferable.
		(The generic kernel is usually only used long enough to compile
		a new kernel anyway.)
	c) Slightly amusing workaround which I used.  Mount the 4.3BSD directory
		tree on /mnt under 4.2BSD.  Write a small program which does
		chroot to /mnt and execs /bin/sh.  Use that shell to recompile
		a 4.3BSD kernel using the 4.3BSD programs under the 4.2BSD
		kernel.  The only thing I noticed which didn't work was csh,
		which seemed confused about directories.  The resulting kernel
		booted, ran, and another kernel compiled under it compared
		except for date stamps.
