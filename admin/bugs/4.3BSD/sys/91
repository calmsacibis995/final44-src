Description:

Starting at line 95 in /sys/vax/locore.s we find the code:

SCBVEC(machcheck):
	tstl	nofault
	bneq	1f
	PUSHR; pushab 6*4(sp); calls $1,_machinecheck; POPR;
	addl2 (sp)+,sp; rei
	.align	2
1:
	casel	_cpu,$1,$VAX_MAX
0:
	.word	8f-0b		# 1 is 780
	.word	5f-0b		# 2 is 750
	.word	5f-0b		# 3 is 730
	.word	7f-0b		# 4 is 8600
	.word	1f-0b		# ???
	.word	1f-0b		# ???
	.word	1f-0b		# ???
	.word	1f-0b		# 8 is 630
5:
#if defined(VAX750) || defined(VAX730)
	mtpr	$0xf,$MCESR
#endif

Now, in /sys/vax/cpu.h VAX_MAX is defined as 8. However the "case"
machine language instruction indexes the branch table starting from
zero, so that one has addr[0] to addr[7]. The "case" instruction
does a "less than or equal" compare of the index into the branch
table that it calculates, and the maximum the programmer gives it.
In this case, the "mtpr" instruction following becomes a part of the
branch table. It is still branched to and executed, but is hard to find
with "adb."
