Subject: setitimer(2)
Index: sys 4.3BSD

Description:
	Setitimer should not check it_interval before confirming
	that it_value is non-zero.
Repeat-By:
	Do a call to setitimer with zero in its it_value field and
	garbage in it's it_interval field.  An error will come back
	rather than just turning off the timer.
Fix:
	Re-arrange the logic.
