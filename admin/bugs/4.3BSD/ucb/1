Subject: sendbug on /nbsd is (was) broken
Index: ucb/sendbug/sendbug.sh 4.3BSD
Date: 09 Aug 85 17:48:56 PDT (Fri)

Description:
	Despite all appearances (sendbug.sh not .csh, initial #! /bin/sh, etc)
	sendbug is written in csh not sh.  It has numerous other problems.
	Note: the source on /usr/src has had the #! /bin/sh problem fixed,
	but the one on /nbsd has not.
Repeat-By:
	cat /usr/ucb/sendbug
Fix:
	replace sendbug by the sh script below.  This works, its being
	used to send this mail ...  (It is also now installed on /nbsd
	so you can safely ignore this message)


#! /bin/sh
#
#	%W% (Berkeley) %E%
# Create a bug report and mail to '4bsd-bugs'.
#

TEMP=/tmp/bug$$
FORMAT=/usr/ucb/bugformat

: ${BUGADDR=4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU}
: ${EDITOR=/usr/ucb/vi}

trap '/bin/rm -f $TEMP' 0 1 2 3 13 15

/bin/cp $FORMAT $TEMP
if $EDITOR $TEMP
then
	if cmp -s $FORMAT $TEMP
	then
		echo "File not changed, no bug report submitted."
		exit
	fi
	case "$#" in
	0) /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi $BUGADDR  < $TEMP ;;
	*) /usr/lib/sendmail -t -oi "$@" < $TEMP ;;
	esac
fi
