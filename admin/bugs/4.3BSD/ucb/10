Subject: 4.3BSD ALPHA vgrind bug

Subject: vgrind shell file calls wrong shell
Index:	ucb/vgrind/vgrind.sh 4.3BSD ALPHA

Description:
	NOTE: THIS IS A 4.3BSD BUG, NOT 4.2BSD.

	The vgrind script is a CSH script, not an SH script.  It
	calls sh on the first line using the #! construct, and
	then promptly barfs.

Repeat-By:
	vgrind -f program.c

Fix:
	The first line of the script, which reads

		#!/bin/sh -

	should be changed to read

		#! /bin/csh -f
