Subject: new argument for talk
Index: ucb/talk 4.3BSD

To 4bsd-ideas@arpa:
     Responding to the talk daemon with "talk user@host" can be
difficult if "host" is complicated, and has been splatted across a
screen full of other stuff.  How about making it possible to reply
with "talk -R", meaning "respond to whoever is currently attempting
contact"?  If more than one parties happen to be doing so
simultaneously, it should present a menu.  (Even when there is
just one other party, it would be useful to be able to find out who
it is before replying, if it was hard to make out to begin with.)
     Perhaps there should also be a front end to the old and new
versions of talk, which would find out which version the other party's
machine runs, and choose the appropriate form?
			Yours,		George Bergman
