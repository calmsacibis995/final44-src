Subject: man paths and /usr/src/ucb/man/man.c
Index: ucb/man/man.c 4.3BSD

The -M option and the MANPATH environment variable hook were broken
in latest version of man.  Enclosed is a context diff with the fix.
I discovered the bug when man stopped accessing the unigrafix manual
pages.  We were trying to setup the manual pages so they would be
automatically installed by the software distribution but the new
man throws a monkey wrench in the whole process.

It would be very helpful if the new man where at least backwards
compatible with the name of the files in the cat* directories, i.e.
cat1/csh.1 instead of cat1/csh.0.   Then the automatic installation
of manual pages would work both here and on vanilla 4.3 (as well
as many System V implementations).

Since there is a certain elegance to the .0 solution (no more
zillion accesses to find out which suffix is correct, especially
in cat.new), it would be understandable if it's not changed, but if
I volunteered to list the necessary changes to man.c and the
/usr/src/man Makefiles, could it be done?
