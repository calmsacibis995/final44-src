Subject: /usr/ucb/man leaves null file if nroff fails
Index: ucb/man.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If nroff fails for any reason (in this case, running
	out of memory), it will leave a null file in /usr/man/cat?
	(i.e. zero length), and man will go ahead and try to 
	display it (in which case you get a blank screen). This
	null file will remain until someone removes it, and
	man will not format the man page until then....

Repeat-By:
	Run man in a condition where nroff will fail (i.e. a fully
	loaded VAX 11/780 with 4 meg of memory and none left for
	nroff :-).
Fix:
	Being that I don't have access to sources, I will suggest what
	I "think" should be done.

	Check the return status of "nroff" -- if it fails, unlink the
	resulting file in /usr/man/cat?. Also, when man starts up and
	finds a file in /usr/man/cat? it should unlink the file and
	reformat (nroff) it again if the file in /usr/man/cat? is
	0 length....
