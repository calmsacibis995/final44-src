Subject: rdist makefile uses `-m 4755' without `-o'
Index: ucb/rdist 4.3BSD

Description:
	If you change the install script to make things owned by
	`bin' unless otherwise specified, rdist gets installed setuid
	bin.  (I know:  `Why would you do that?'  It keeps things a
	bit less crazy around here.)

Repeat-by:
	I think I just said that.

Fix:
	Dump has the same glitch, incidentally.  (But not sendmail anymore!)
