Subject: ex doesn't wait for so commands in tagged scripts
Index: ucb/ex 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The attached shar scripts show a fairly amusing problem in
	ex; I'm told it didn't exist in 4.2BSD.  It appears that
	ex doesn't wait for "so" commands to finish before proceeding,
	in tagged scripts.
Repeat-By:
	Unshar the attached; do a "sh doall", notice that the write
	message appears before the substitution message, notice that
	the substitution never got written out.

echo x - doall
sed 's/^X//' >doall << 'END-of-doall'
Xex tttt << T
Xso editsss
Xw!
XT
END-of-doall
echo x - editsss
sed 's/^X//' >editsss << 'END-of-editsss'
X1,$ s/./a/g
END-of-editsss
echo x - tttt
sed 's/^X//' >tttt << 'END-of-tttt'
XAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
XAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
XAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
XAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
END-of-tttt
exit
