Subject: Bug in ftp (kind of)
Index: ucb/ftp 4.3BSD

Well, it's not really a bug - just a common source of user error.  When you
use ftp to login to a remote machine, and then do:
ftp> ls filename
it is possible that you may not be prepared for the result.  In UNIX, this
command means "list filename".  A casual user might expect ftp to use the
same semantics, seeing as how the same name (ls) is used.  However, what ftp
does is to execute the "ls" command in the working directory on the remote
machine, and SAVE THE RESULTS IN the file filename ON THE LOCAL MACHINE!
AARGH! What happened to the valuable info. I had in filename?  Whoops! (or
rather Yikes!)  It got deleted!!!  %$#*@&)(^ computer.  I just lost three
weeks worth of work.  I know, I know, I should have kept a copy.  But what
would you expect a command like "ls filename" to do?
Try doing:
ftp> help ls
It replies:
ls		nlist contents of remote directory
Now that *does* sound a bit like the UNIX ls doesn't it?

Won't someone please, please change the name "ls" to something
else?  Or better still, use the redirection symbol to do redirection?
That would make the world a better place.
