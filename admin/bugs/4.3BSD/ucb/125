Subject: Bug in 4.{2,3}BSD 'vi'
Index: ucb/ex/ex_unix.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Running 'ex' on Encore UMAX 4.2, the '%' and '#' constructs
	fail in '!' escapes.

	The problem is that when a '%' or '#' is expanded, the 'QUOTE'
	attribute (the 0x80 bit) is set in each character for
	pretty-printing purposes.  This string (with high bits on for most
	characters) is passed to the shell unchanged and havoc ensuses.

	This does not fail on 4.2 or 4.3 (or ports) because the kernel
	strips out the 0x80 bit when doing pathname tranlation in namei().

	The UMAX file system code is NOT a direct port of the 4.2
	code, having the 0x80 bit set causes an error.  In fact, the shell
	does some other strangeness with this string, so it never
	reaches the kernel.

Repeat-By:
	Edit a file with 'ex' under UMAX 4.2 and do ":!ls -l %' - something
	will go wrong.
Fix:
	One fix would be to change the kernel, but my sensibilities
	say that UMAX is doing the right thing in rejecting path names with
	high bits set, and that 'ex' is doing the wrong thing by passing them.

	So here is my fix to 'ex' to remove the QUOTE bit from the unix
	command buffer.
