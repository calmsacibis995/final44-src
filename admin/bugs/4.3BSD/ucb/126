Subject: the user@host:file format of rcp doesn't work
Index: ucb 4.3BSD

Description:
	The user@host:filename format of rcp doesn't work as described
	in the manual. Whenever I use this format rcp says "Who are you?"
	and does nothing. I should have permission since if use
	rlogin host -l user I get on without having to give a password.
	Is this a bug ao a manual omission?

	Further comments: This syntax is very nice. Why doesn't rlogin
	and rsh support the same syntax, e.g. rlogin user@host rather
	than rlogin host -l user. Even if that change isn't made, rlogin
	should accept the switch before the host also! I often get the
	order wrong.

Repeat-By:
	rcp foo user@host:file
