Subject: Question: Security problems with allowing others to use "quota uid"?
Index: ucb/quota.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Is there a problem in letting others use "quota uid" to look at
	other people's disk quotas and current usage?  Was this more of a
	matter of taste, or a security related problem?  We would like to
	provide a method where instructors could examine their students'
	disk quota and current usage; this seems like the obvious choice.
	We can't see any problem with letting other students knowing disk
	quotas or usage.  Was wondering if we are missing something?

Repeat-By:
	Typing "quota <uid>" where you are not <uid> and not "root" will
	result in "permission denied" as according to the manual page.

Fix:
	The "fix" to this is to remove the checking code assuming that
	there is not a reason for this that is not obvious:
