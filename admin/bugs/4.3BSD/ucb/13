Subject: checknr doesn't recognize the tbl command .T& as valid
Index: 	ucb/checknr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	"Checknr" does not recognize the ".T&" tbl preprocessor
	command, and prints an erroneous error message.

Repeat-By:
	Create a file "foo.ms" containing the following tbl file:

.TS
c s s s.
Foo
_
.T&
c c s s
c c s s
c c c c.
	Percent by weight
Foo
Type	Bar	Zot	Spam
_
.T&
l n n n.
Bletch	0.1	0.5	13.0
.TE

	Now run "checknr foo.ms", and watch the error messages:

6: Unknown command: .T&
14: Unknown command: .T&

Fix:
	Add "T&" to the array "knowncmds" in checknr.c.
