I have noticed that when recovering changes in a file from an editing
session that was killed or interrupted using the vi -r command, the
file is marked as unchanged so that when the user exits using the
"ZZ" command, he loses the changes and cannot recover them anymore.
This over course only happens if the user recovers the changes and exits
before making any additional ones. This is somewhat of a nuisance, as 
several times people have lost their data this way. Can vi be altered so that
it either: (1) marks the file as changed and automatically writes it upon 
exit, (2) does not delete the recover file in /usr/preserve, or
(3) marks the file as changed and readonly forcing the user to either
write it out to another file or quiting using the sequence :q!.
