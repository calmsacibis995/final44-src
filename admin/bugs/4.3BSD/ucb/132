Subject: Improved fix to allow rdist to propagate the sticky bit
Index: ucb/rdist/server.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
    Currently rdist doesn't propagate sticky bits, but the fix proposed by
    dls@j.cc.purdue.edu has a minor security problem.  Normally only root is
    allowed to set the sticky bit, but with the proposed fix if a user has
    a machine on which he has root privileges, and then rdist's (as himself)
    a file to a machine on which he does not have root privs, he can
    introduce binaries with the sticky bit set.  No big deal, but here's a
    better way to fix it.

Repeat-By:
    touch /tmp/hose;chmod 1751 /tmp/hose;rdist -c /tmp/hose host:

Fix:
1038c1038,1039
< 	    (mode & 06000) && chmod(file, mode) < 0) {
---
> 	    (mode & (06000 | (userid ? 0 : S_ISVTX))) &&
> 	    chmod(file, mode) < 0) {
