Subject: vi on vms doesn't preserve the protection modes.
Index: ucb/ex/ex_io.c 4.3BSD

Here is a bug fix for conrad huangs vms version of vi. I am not sure
if you want it, but here it is anyway. (This is a fix for running it
on VMS not unix).

Description:
	When using vi on a vms system, if the user writes to a file
	the modes on the newer version should be the same as they were
	on the next most recent version, but instead are a bitwise
	"and" of the user's default protection mode and "666".
Repeat-By:
	On a vms system:
		1) check your default protection mode:
			$ show protection
		2) use vi to edit a file whose protection mode is not
		   the same as your default protection mode.
		3) use :wq to write the file out and quit the edit.
		4) compare the protection modes of the 2 most recent 
		   versions of the file. They will be different. This is
		   wrong
			$ dir/prot file*
