Subject: Bug in vi (v3.7) - modeline problem
Index: ucb/ex/ex_io.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Vi will appear to hang given a +n or +/pattern on the command line
	when used with the modeline feature.

Repeat-by:
	Create a file with a "vi: se wm=5:" in the first or last 5 lines.
	Set modeline (i.e. "set modeline") in EXINIT or ~/.exrc or ./.exrc.
	Try to start up vi with "vi +2 file". Note that it prints out the
	name, line and character count and nothing else....

Fix:
	Set peekc to 0 before doing the +n command in rop3() - apply
	following context diff to ex_io.c.
