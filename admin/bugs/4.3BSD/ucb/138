Subject: indent program corrupts working code ("=!" --> "!=")
Index: ucb/indent 4.3BSD

Description:
	When a particular construction,
		<variable>=!<variable>
	is used without spaces after the "=!", the indent program
	corrupts the code.  The resulting code may still compile, but
	be incorrect!

Repeat-By:

Type "indent input.c output.c" using the code below:

The input.c file looks like this:

main()
	{
	int i=0;

	i=!i;

	if(i) printf("true\n");
	}

Unfortunately, the generated output.c file looks like this:

main()
{
	int             i = 0;

	i != i;

	if (i)
		printf("true\n");
}

---
Notice the change in the line "i=!i;" to "i != i;".  Both compile, but produce
different results.

Sorry about that.  This is a side effect of the `indent converts
old style assignment operators' `feature'.  I intend to remove this
`feature' someday---perhaps at about the same time as 4BSD cc stops
supporting it as well.  There is an argument against this: if the
compiler stops supporting it, perhaps indent should continue to
support it so that one can translate old code mechanically.  I
think I am going to ignore this argument: most of said old code
is in /usr/src, not in users' sources, at least per my own experience.

Consider this a warning:  The next BSD (apply usual disclaimers)
will probably not support =<op> operators.  That is, `i =+ 1' will
not compile, though `i += 1' will.
