Subject: rdist won't expand ~/${VAR} correctly
Index: 	ucb/rdist 4.3BSD

Description:
	An rdist of "/etc/${ETC}" will work fine, but a variable expansion
	of anything with a ~ (tilde) in it won't work...
	When I first tried to update by bin, I got the following errors
	that were identical for many machines...

	updating host medea
	updating: /ic3/staff/kjpires/.rhosts
	updating: /ic3/staff/kjpires/.tset
	updating: /ic3/staff/kjpires/bin/less
	installing: /ic3/staff/kjpires/bin/postscript
	rdist: /ic3/staff/kjpires/bin/
	: No such file or directory
	rdist: server: expected control record
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexp'
	Y19456 447154897
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpec'
	Y57344 491114721
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpecte'
	Y13312 445094173

Repeat-By:
	Make an rdist file that looks like this:

	BINFILES =      ( call fcc idle less lock map postscript pup query \
			rcc rwhoson shar systat total tree udp )
	BIN =           ( ~/bin/${BINFILES} )
	${BIN} -> localhost

	Or like this:

	BINFILES =      ( call fcc idle less lock map postscript pup query \
			rcc rwhoson shar systat total tree udp )
	( ~/bin/${BINFILES} ) -> localhost

	and execute an "rdist -b" on it...
	(The -b option is necessary to force a file to be transmitted...)
	You get things like:

	updating host localhost
	rdist: /ic3/staff/kjpires/bin/
	: No such file or directory
	rdist: server: expected control record
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexp'
	Y19456 447154897
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpec'
	Y57344 491114721
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpecte'
	Y13312 445094173
	rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected response 'rdist: update: unexpected '
