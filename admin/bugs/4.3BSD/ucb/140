Subject: ftp infinite loops on input if user logs out.
Index: ucb/ftp/main.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a user logs out before getting an ftp prompt (for example,
	after starting a length file transfer), the gets() in cmdscanner()
	fails, but not with an eof.  Thus the cmdscanner() goes into
	an infinite loop.
Repeat-By:
	ftp somehost
	start a length file transfer
	(background the ftp)
	logout
	log in again
	the ftp is still running and will continue to run.
Fix:
	When gets() fails, check ferror() as well.  Change:

		if (gets(line) == 0) {
			if (feof(stdin))
				quit();
			break;
		}
	to:
		if (gets(line) == 0) {
			if (feof(stdin) || ferror(stdin))
				quit();
			break;
		}
