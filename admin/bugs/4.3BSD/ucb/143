BUG PORTED TO UTX? 
Yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
It's not clear from the manpage what to type if you want to select a
particular login session: is it /dev/tty00 or tty00 or t00?  Trying it with
ptys always seems to result in "your party is not logged in".

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
