This is a good idea, but it would definitely require changes in the code
of ex3.7preserve and possibly also in vi -- neither of which we are likely
to take the responsibility for hacking.  I have forwarded your message to
"bugs@ucbvax.berkeley.edu" in the hope that they will forward it to the
4.xBSD maintainers.
