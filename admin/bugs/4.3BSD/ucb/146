Subject: Tset/reset defaults are inconsistent with system
Index: 	ucb/tset/tset.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The defaults used by tset are inconsistent with the system wide
	defaults in /usr/include/sys/ttychars.h.  When tset finds a NULL
	erase, kill, or interupt character, it sets them according to
	internal constants.

	Also "tset -k" sets KILL to ^X "for historical reasons."  Will
	this ever be changed?
Repeat-By:
	Change /usr/include/sys/ttychars.h and use tset.
Fix:
	Include <sys/ttychars.h> in tset.c and use the values declared
	there as the defaults.
