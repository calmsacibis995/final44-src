Subject: mail - suggested change
Index: ucb/mail 4.3BSD

Description:
	This is a suggested change rather than a bug report. I just
	inadvertantly destroyed some mail by writing to a name that turned
	out to be an existing directory name, and then, not noticing the
	error message, quit mail thinking that the message had been saved.
	Though this is admittedly my fault, it would be nice to be able to
	get at deleted messages after the program has been exited.
Fix:
	I can think of several possible solutions. The best, however
	would be a command-line switch that would cause mail to 
	automatically back up /usr/spool/mail/... into some file that
	I can get access to (as in the current directory), and then a
	second switch that would cause mail to use the backed-up version
	rather than the real mail box.
