Subject: vacation does not test status from dbminit()
Index: ucb/vacation.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If someone creates a .forward file saying to pipe their
	mail through the `vacation' program, but forgets to run
	vacation -I, sendmail returns some interesting error
	messages.

Repeat-by:
	% rm -f .vacation.dir .vacation.pag
	% cat << EOF > .forward
	$USER@`hostname`
	EOF
	% mail -s foo $USER < /dev/null

	Obviously vacation should do something differently if
	the dbminit() call returns other than 0, but I am not
	quite sure what.

Chris
