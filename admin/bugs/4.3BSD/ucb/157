Subject: rlogin parsing of .rhosts
Index: ucb 4.3BSD

Description:
	Adding a person to one's .rhosts requires knowing the exact format
	by which that person's host is represented as a text string when
	it connects to the local host.  For example, if I want to add myself
	to the .rhosts of another computer at Berkeley, I must say
		ernie bh
	but if I want to add myself to some .rhosts outside Berkeley it's
		ernie.Berkeley.EDU bh
	with exactly those letters capitalized and no others.  This is dumb.
Repeat-By:
	Try to rlogin various places, you'll see!
Fix:
	rlogin (and also rcp, etc.) should compare host numbers, not names.
	That is, it should translate the name in the .rhosts line, and
	separately translate the name of the remote host in question, and
	see if it gets the same host number.
