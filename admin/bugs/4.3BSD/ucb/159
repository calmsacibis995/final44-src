Subject: vmstat -silly crashes

Index: ucb/systat/main.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Now that lookup returns 0 for unknown, -1 for ambigious,
	`systat -thisisnotacommand' crashes.

Repeat-by:
	% systat -x
	Segmentation fault
	%

Fix:
	This does not distinguish between ambiguous and unknown,
	but at the moment there are no ambiguous commands.

	Incidentally, I think it would be much cleaner to put
	the subcommands into the main table; then one could do
	(e.g.) `systat -del\ rk0 -vmstat'.
