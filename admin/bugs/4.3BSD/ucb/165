Subject: special variable problem

	- There is at least one problem with special variables in compiled
	functions in Franz.  The code below works if foo is uncompiled.
	
		(defun foo (&aux *bar*)
		  (declare (special *bar*))
		  (berf))
		
		(defun berf ()
		  (declare (special *bar*))
		  (format t "*bar*: ~s" *bar*))

	When foo is compiled, the error,

		"Attempt to take the value of the unbound symbol *BAR*,"

	is produced.  I assume this is incorrect behavior: compiled code
	should produce the same results as interpreted.
