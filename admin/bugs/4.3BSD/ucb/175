Deficiency in Vi's Lisp Mode

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:

Lisp mode in vi cannot be turned on an off with the
":se lisp" and ":se nolisp" ex commands.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
These two commands just don't work.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

Enter vi.  Type the ex command ":se lisp".  Type, for example,
(car '(a b c)).  Showmatch will not be on, i.e., when closing
paren is typed, curser does not flash on corresponding opening
paren.

(Or you can enter lisp mode with "vi -l" and try to turn
it off by typing ":se nolisp".)

SUGGESTED FIX:
I dunno.

OTHER COMMENTS:
Otherwise the Lisp option seems to be working ok, though it is
not currently documented in the vi UTX/32 manpage.  Jan Penovich
at the fort (UTX TW) says they plan to document the "-l" option
in release 1.2.
