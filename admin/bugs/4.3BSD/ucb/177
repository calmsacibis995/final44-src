Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) dbx suffers internal error, wedges terminal
#Index: /usr/ucb/dbx MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87)
Index: ucb/dbx 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a user (like me) mistakenly uses the 'n' command when working with
	a core file, dbx suffers an internal error and leaves the terminal
	in a strange state.

Repeat-By:
		Script started on Sun Nov  8 17:01:39 1987
		$ echo 'main(){abort();}' > try.c
		$ cc -g try.c
		$ a.out
		Illegal instruction - core dumped
		$ dbx
		dbx version 3.22 of 9/3/87 20:32 (elsie).
		Type 'help' for help.
		enter object file name (default is `a.out'): 
		reading symbolic information ...
		[using memory image in core]
		(dbx) n
		can't continue execution
		(dbx) stop in main
		[1] stop in main
		(dbx) n
		dbx: internal error: error 3 trying to step process
		$ 
		script done on Sun Nov  8 17:02:36 1987

	Note that this occurs on a VAX 11/750; the terminal is wedged just
	after the "internal error" message above.
