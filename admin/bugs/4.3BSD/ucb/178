Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) mail muffs replies to dotted & Reply-to'ed mail
#Index: ucb/Mail/config.c MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: ucb/Mail/config.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) /usr/ucb/mail command muffs replies to
	letters that feature both "Reply-To:" lines and domain-containing
	addresses.

Repeat-By:
	In the script below, the file "try" contains a piece of electronic
	mail that I actually received showing the problem; the file "try2"
	contains the smallest piece of mock mail I was able to generate that
	showed up the problem.

    Thanks for the diffs.  I haven't seen the first four, though...
    
    I am (slowly) getting it moved over to SysV - it's not too hard,
    but I'm not all that familiar with BSD, so I'm having to figure
    out what corresponds to what (e.g. rindex is strrchr on SysV).
    I'll let you know how it work out...

	Note the bogus
	    To: seismo!dale4.virginia:edu!paw3c
	reply addresses generated above.

Fix:
	This fix is almost surely wrong, but it will have to do until I
	can figure out why '.' was put in "metanet" in the first place.
