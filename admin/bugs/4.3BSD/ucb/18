Subject: not enough space for termcap strings
Index: ucb/ex/ex_tty.h 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
In ex_tty.h, tspace is not dimensioned big enough. Running vi on a
terminal with a long and complicated termcap will cause vi to dump
core.
Fix:
Dimensioning tspace to 1024 would be surely be enough, since
that's the maximum termcap is documented to handle, but we've found
that 512 is big enough.
