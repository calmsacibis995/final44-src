Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) dbx gives misleading usage message
#Index: /usr/ucb/dbx MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: ucb/dbx 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MORE/bsd 4.3 dbx command gives a misleading usage message if
	white space is missing in the command line.

Repeat-By:
			Script started on Thu May 28 14:19:00 1987
			$ dbx -I/name/of/some/source/directory
			dbx version 3.24 of 3/21/87 19:13 (fred).
			Type 'help' for help.
			/usr/ucb/dbx: fatal error: unknown option 'I'
			$ exit

			script done on Thu May 28 14:19:35 1987

	The problem with the command is *not* that 'I' is an unknown option
	but rather that a space is needed after the '-I'.

Fix:
	Change the diagnostic message or, preferably, change dbx to accept
	usage such as "dbx -I/name/of/some/source/directory" (which would make
	dbx's behavior match that of cc).
