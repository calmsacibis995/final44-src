Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 ucb/mail's "Status" additions cause bogus mail notices
#Index: ucb/sysline/sysline.c MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: ucb/sysline/sysline.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The /usr/ucb/mail command's habit of adding "Status: XX" lines to
	mail mesages confuses poor /bin/sh and /usr/ucb/sysline in their
	determinations of whether a user has new mail.  Csh is immune to
	mail's machinations.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Tue Mar 10 22:56:46 1987
	$ /bin/sh
	$ MAIL=/usr/spool/mail/ado
	$ /usr/ucb/mail ado < /dev/null
	No message, no subject; hope that's ok
	$ sleep 10
	You have new mail.
	$ ls -l /usr/spool/mail/ado
	-rw-------  1 ado         80965 Mar 10 22:57 /usr/spool/mail/ado
	$ echo q | /usr/ucb/mail > /dev/null
	You have new mail.
	$ ls -l /usr/spool/mail/ado
	-rw-------  1 ado         80975 Mar 10 22:57 /usr/spool/mail/ado
	$ exit

	Even though the mail file grew only because /usr/ucb/mail dropped a
	"Status" line in it, "sh" thinks there's "new" mail.

	Sysline has similar problems; they're hard to show here given
	sysline's screen-oriented nature.

	(Heck, /bin/sh.4bsd and the Korn shell have problems too. . .but we
	won't go into that here.)

Fix:
	Well. . .we do have source for sysline, so we'll rip off the (working)
	algorithm from /bin/csh and adapt it to sysline's purposes:

mailseen()
{
	FILE *mfd;
	register n;
	register char *cp;
	char lbuf[100], sendbuf[100], *bufend;
	char seenspace;
	int retval = 0;

	if (stat(username, &mstbuf) < 0) {
		mailsize = 0;
		return 0;
	}
#ifdef ASWAS
	if (mstbuf.st_size <= mailsize || (mfd = fopen(username,"r")) == NULL) {
#else /* !ASWAS */
	if (mstbuf.st_size <= mailsize ||
	    mstbuf.st_atime > mstbuf.st_ctime ||
	    (mfd = fopen(username, "r")) == NULL) {
#endif /* !ASWAS */
		mailsize = mstbuf.st_size;
		return 0;
	}
...
