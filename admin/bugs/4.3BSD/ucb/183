Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 "sccs print" doesn't (with fix)
#Index: ucb/sccs.c MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: ucb/sccs.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The command "sccs print" doesn't.

Repeat-By:
	On an as-distributed by Mt. Xinu 4.3 system, type in the command
		sccs print
	and note the result:
		sccs SYSERR: cannot execute /usr/5bin/prt
		No such file or directory

Fix:
	In "/usr/src/ucb/sccs.c", change the line reading

	"print",	CMACRO,	0,			"prt -e/get -p -m -s",

	to read

	"print",	CMACRO,	0,			"prs -e/get -p -m -s",
