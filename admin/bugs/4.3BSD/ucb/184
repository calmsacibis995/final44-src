Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) mail's Reply command ignores "reply-to" (w/fix)
#Index: ucb/Mail/cmd3.c MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: ucb/Mail/cmd3.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "Mail Reference Manual" reads, in part:

		Reply
			Note the capital R in the name.  Frame a reply to a one
			or more messages. . .If the original message included a
			"reply-to" header field, the reply will go *only* to the
			recipient named by "reply-to."

	But when the capital-R Reply command is used, the "reply-to" field is
	ignored.

Fix:
	First, change the "Mail Reference Manual" to read "Frame a reply to one
	or more messages. . ." rather than "Frame a reply to a one or more
	messages. . ." (and suffer the wrath of Lawrence Welk fans).  Second:
