Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 "more" errs when you've "tset vt100"
#Index: ucb/more MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: ucb/more 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "more" command can produce incorrect output if you're on a
	VT100 terminal and have done a "tset vt100".

Repeat-By:
	Get on a VT100.  Feed these commands to the Bourne shell:

		awk 'BEGIN {
			for (i = 1; i <= 80; ++i)
				printf "X"
			printf "\n\tThis is only a test\n"
			exit
		}' > try

	Then type in the command
		cat try
	and note the second line of the file begins with a tab character.
	Finally, type in the command
		more try
	and note that the leading tab character of the second line has
	disappeared.  This happens regardless of the VT100's hardware
	automatic margin setting.

Fix:
	The "vi" command seems to handle VT100's properly; the thing to do
	might be to appropriate the "xn" handling logic from "vi".
