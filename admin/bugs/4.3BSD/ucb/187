Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 tset command fails to set rows and columns (with fix)
#Index: ucb/tset/tset.c MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: ucb/tset/tset.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The tset command sometimes fails to change the system's notion of the
	number of columns a terminal has.  This messes up subsequent commands
	such as "more".

Repeat-By:
	Log on to the system on an 80-column vt100.  Then type the commands
		set noglob
		eval `/usr/ucb/tset -s vt100-w-nam`
		/usr/ucb/reset
	and note the terminal has been placed in 132-column mode.
	Now use the command
		more /etc/passwd
	and note that output lines are still being wrapped at column 80.  Do a
		stty all
	and note that "columns 80" is part of the output--that's the clue as
	to where the problem lies.

Fix:
	Make the indicated change to the window-size-setting code in the
	function "main" of "tset.c":

		columns = tgetnum("co");
		lines = tgetnum("li");

		/* Set window size */
		(void) ioctl(FILEDES, TIOCGWINSZ, (char *)&win);
#ifdef ASWAS
		if (win.ws_row == 0 && win.ws_col == 0 &&
		    lines > 0 && columns > 0) {
#else /* ASWAS */
		if (lines > 0 && lines != win.ws_row ||
			columns > 0 && columns != win.ws_col) {
#endif /* !ASWAS */
			win.ws_row = lines;
			win.ws_col = columns;
			(void) ioctl(FILEDES, TIOCSWINSZ, (char *)&win);
		}
