Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 vi bug (no fix yet)
#Index: ucb/vi MORE/bsd 4.3
Index: ucb/vi 4.3BSD

Description:
	"vi" breaks if a command line startup command is used with a file
	that has imbedded vi commands.

Repeat-By:
	Execute these Bourne shell commands:
		awk 'BEGIN { print "\tvi:set tabstop=4:\n\tzzz" ; exit }' > try
		EXINIT='set modeline' vi +/z try

	"vi" prints information about the name and size of the
	file being edited, but does not display the contents of the file.
	The file *is* displayed once you've typed in any of several control
	characters (control-L, for example), but the imbedded "set tabstop"
	command has been ignored.  The imbedded command is *not* ignored if
	a "straight"
		EXINIT='set modeline' vi try
	is done.
