Subject: -s option breaks
Index: 	ucb/from.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	-s option not supported properly in some situations.
	When the send mail "from" line looks something like
	From "STEVE JACOBSON%a.sdscnet"@lll-mfe.arpa (followed by date stuff),
	the -s option is difficult to use.

	1. the user has to include a quote mark in the -s argument.
	2. a blank in the -s argument causes the match to fail
	3. upper case characters in the -s argument causes the match to fail
Repeat-By:
	look at code or supply such an example.
Fix:
	alter match() in from.c to

	1. skip quote marks in the line argument.
	2. don't quit comparing the strings when a blank is encountered.
	3. perform the tolower() processing on the -s argument along with
	   the current tolower() processing on the "from" line.
