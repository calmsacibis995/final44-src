Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) dbx dumps core
Index: ucb/dbx 4.3BSD

Description:
	Typographical errors may cause dbx to dump core.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Thu Sep  3 18:01:50 1987
	$ echo 'main(){}' > try.c
	$ cc -g try.c
	$ dbx a.out
	dbx version 3.22 of 5/28/87 16:01 (elsie).
	Type 'help' for help.
	reading symbolic information ...
	[using memory image in core]
	(dbx) print 1, main
	1 main 
	(dbx) print 1\ main
	Memory fault - core dumped
	$ exit

Fix:
	Remove the '\' command that leads to the core dumps,
	or disallow function names as the right-hand operator of '\'.
