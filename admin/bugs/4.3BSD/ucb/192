Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) vi can't put named buffers after global subs.
Index: ucb/ex/ex_vmain.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The vi command forgets named buffers after a global substitution.

Repeat-By:
	Use the command
		(echo dog;echo cat;echo mouse) > try
	to create a test file, then type in
		vi try
	Now use the vi command
		"ayy
	to yank the first line into named buffer "a", the command
		:g/./s///
	(followed by a RETURN) to remove the first character of each line,
	and then type
		"ap
	to try to retrieve the contents of named buffer a.
	Oh where, oh where has my little dog gone?

Fix:
