chfn doesn't handle multiple users with same uid

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.1
Patch Level:  		C
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
chfn
SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)
software
PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)
low
DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
If /etc/passwd contains several entries with the same user id, chfn will
attempt to update the first entry with the uid, not the entry used to login.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

Be careful about fixing this. This behaviour is present in many programs
including some versions of mail and some utilities depend on it.
Ask zimmerm about my suggestions for resolving formal/informal user name
debate.

Due to wide spread of this behaviour is probably in a library function
like getpasswent (or something like that).

I suppose I could attack the "misconfigured" passwd file.  In particular,
the administrators on midas have seen fit to use a single user id for me
and all the other Urbana accounts.  When I try to chfn there, I discover that
the first entry with that uid already has a full name: "The Compion People".

I suppose that we could wait for P1003 or SVID to mature enough to require
sensable behavior.  We probably will get sensable behavior much sooner from
the Secure Unix project.

If first match is important for some utilities, then getpwent should preserve
the behavior and chfn can call something else to do the right thing.

Nooo! Don't make things have to go around getpwent. Make getpwent take an
option to not grab the first entry with a particular uid, maybe, but writing
something to 'sort of replace' a library routine is asking for trouble the
next time someone decides to change the format of the passwd file.

The "sensible" behavior on secure UNIX is to require that each
userid be associated with one and only one username.  This is
necessary for the TCSEC auditing requirement that each user be
uniquely identifiable.

Another aspect of the "sensible" behavior on secure UNIX is that
we have done away (for the time being, at least) with finger
information.  We decided to clear that muck out of the password file.
(We may implement it in the future via some other mechanism - the
latest proposal being that each user maintains finger info in files
that live in his home directory.)

At the AT&T Bell Labs and ISL Computing Centers, the standard calls foor
not only unique UIDs for each user but also unique GIDs for each user
(which is usually the same number as the UID).  The idea is that a user may
add other users to his group but they aren't there by default.  There are
also GIDs for various projects that the user may 'chgrp' into if he is a
member of that group.
