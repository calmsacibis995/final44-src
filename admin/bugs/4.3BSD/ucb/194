PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low) Medium

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
Attempts to use "eval `tset -s ...`" in a csh .login file often generates a
"setenv: too many arguments" error.  Using echo shows that tset -s is not
generating any terminal capability string and no trailing ';' to separate the
"setenv" from the closing "unset noglob".  This probably happens when the
environment variable TERMCAP doesn't exist.  Often a second attempt at tset,
eg. "source .login" after the initial .login fails, will do the right thing.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
I peek at the source for tset; it's a disaster of assumptions.
The routine "wrtermcap(Ttycap)" is failing to produce any output - it should
always write a ';', or better yet the ';' should be part of the write after
"wrtermcap" is called.
