rwho ignores perfectly reasonable host names

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The rwhod daemon eliminates messages from any host whose name contains
characters other than a-z and 0-9.  There is no reason for this limit.
The test should be for printable characters.  Many, many hosts have
hyphens in their names.  The original Berkeley documentation said that
names with unprintable characters would be discarded, but the Berkeley code
contained the same more restrictive test we include.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
None -- the "bad" host names simply don't appear in rwho/ruptime lists.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:
This code is in our version:
	verify(name)
		register char *name;
	{
		register int size = 0;
	
		while (*name) {
			if (!isalpha(*name) || !isalnum(*name))
				return (0);
			name++, size++;
		}
		return (size > 0);
	}

This code allows all printable characters, arguably the correct set:
verify(name)
	register char *name;
{
	register int size = 0;

	while (*name) {
		if (!isprint(*name))
			return (0);
		name++, size++;
	}
	return (size > 0);
}

OTHER COMMENTS:

This bug was reported before and the problem was "fixed" by changing
the manpage to say that names containing "Some printable characters
such as..." would be deleted as well as those with unprintable
characters.  The exact set of impermissable characters is unspecified.
I am always open to reasonable explanations, but I think
this "fix" is broken.
