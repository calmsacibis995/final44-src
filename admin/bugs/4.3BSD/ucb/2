Subject: /usr/ucb/script hangs
Index: 	ucb/script.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Under certain conditions, script will hang when the user tries
	to exit.  One has to kill the script.

	As a side note, the initial message "Script started, file is ..."
	is sometimes not printed in its entirety.  The only thing I can
	see that could be causing this is the switching of the terminal
	into raw mode immediately after the message is printed (via the
	fixtty subroutine).  However, neither the addition of "fflush(stdout);"
	nor "fflush(stdout); fsync(fileno(stdout));" seems to fix the problem.
Repeat-By:
	Perform the following commands

	prompt% script
	% sleep 10 &
	% exit

	At this point you will hang until the sleep command finishes.
