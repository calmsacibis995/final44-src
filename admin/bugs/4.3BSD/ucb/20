Subject: Finger options not propogated on remote finger
Index: 	ucb/finger.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Finger options (such as -s to get short form output) are
	ignored if you finger over the network.
Repeat-By:
	Try "finger -s mckusick@pawlonia" -- this gives -l form output
	even though -s is specified.  Compare to "finger -s mckusick".
