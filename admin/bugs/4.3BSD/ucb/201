SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
dbx MAXNFUNCS too small

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		1.2, 1.3, 2.0pilot
Product Name:           UTX/32
Hardware Environment:   9080 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME: dbx

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER) Software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low) 5

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
dbx will not run on an executable which has more than 1001 procedures.  it
arbitrarily defines MAXNFUNCS to be 1001, and uses that to parameterize
various tables, i guess. it should either be set higher or the things that
use it should be allocated dynamically. 

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
dbx version 1 of 6/28/86 19:11 (dolly).
Type 'help' for help.
reading symbolic information ...dbx: internal error: too many procedures/functions

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
% dbx xemacs

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:

unfortunately, if you have someting that large you probably need a good
debugger.
