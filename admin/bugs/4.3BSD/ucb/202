checknr -s is broken

Operating System:  	UTX/32
Release:  		2.0

MODULE NAME: checknr

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER) software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low) 1

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The checknr test in the test suite fails on fang.  It fails because
the -s flag, in addition to supressing errors about \s commands,
also seems to suppress errors about \f commands.  
This bug appears in BSD4.3.  It seemed to be fixed for UTX (the bug
does not show up on burt) but is back in 2.0.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
run checknr on /np1/Ovrflow/testing/Complete/sqa/data_ca/checknr.1r.d on
fang. Notice it finds an error on line 9.
run checknr -s on the same file.
It does not find the error on line 9, even though it still should.

SUGGESTED FIX:
