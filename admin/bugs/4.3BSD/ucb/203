MODULE NAME:
	vi

SPR TYPE:  (Software/Doc/ER)
	software

PRIORITY:  (1 = High, 5 = Low)
	1 (all of my problems are high priorty)

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	I have one of my function keys programmed to input the following
	characters while in VI:

	:wGo--------^M^[!!spell %^M

	This string writes out the file,
	Moves the cursor to the end of the file,
	adds a series of dashes to the file,
	calls spell which deposits it output at the end of the file.

	Spell completes and deposits the misspelled words at the end of
	the file, but vi will redraw the screen weird. ^L does not
	fix the problem.  If you type :set number, the screen is
	drawn correctly.

	You should try this to actually see what happens.  If you
	still have problems understanding the bug, come see me.

	(this worked under 1.3)
