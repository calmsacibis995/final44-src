Broken Pipe message when stdout for look is closed before input closed

Operating System:       4.2 BSD

MODULE NAME: look

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
look a | head -3
gives the first three lines of the dictionary followed by a
Broken Pipe     message

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
look a | head -1
produces:
a
Broken Pipe

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
look a | head -3

or
look a | more
and quit (type 'q')

both produce Broken Pipe messages before exiting.

SUGGESTED FIX:

is this really a bug?

It depends on what your definition of a bug is.  An error message
like "Broken Pipe" while running a standard command (or piping 2
standard UNIX commands together), I would deem to be a bug.

Shouldn't error messages appear to a user only when the user or the
operating system does something terribly wrong?  Is there a reason
why someone shouldn't execute "look a | head -2"?  Shouldn't this at
least be documented as an error message to ignore in most cases?

The commands in this instance work correctly, but the error message
seems to be telling me that there's something wrong.  It is confusing
for a user to get an error message when one isn't expected--I keep
looking for what I did wrong to produce the message.

I would think that look would be smart enough to handle its output in the
same manner that cat does.  (I'm assuming the problem lies with look.)
For example, why does

	cat file | head -2

not produce a "Broken Pipe" message, whereas

	look f | head -2

produce a "Broken Pipe" message?


Additionally,

	look f | tail -2

does not produce a "Broken Pipe" message.  Confusing, isn't it?

Lastly, I believe that error messages should be generated on exceptional
errors only, not routinely.  During the three-mile island meltdown
there were over 50 bells and whistles going off simultaneously,
some relating to "exceptional" errors, others not.  I wonder why it took
them over 2 days to figure out what exactly was going on....
(The extreme noise was said to be unbelievable.)

Enough said.  Admittedly, the look problem here is not a high priority item.

Head breaks the pipe as soon as you've seen enough.  Would you rather wait
for head to silently let the rest of its input file go by?  Tail has to wait for
eof on the pipe.  Look was just doing a perror when it's write failed.
It's probably a bug in cat that it doesn't report an error.  Or maybe it
checks for broken pipe as a special case.  Compare this to the case of
"write failed, file system full".

Broken pipe is an entirely understandable bit of information.  If look had
retried the write 50 times and reported an error on each attempt, then I'd
complain.

Well, it's completely understandable to US, but I suspect there
are a lot of novices who have gotten "Broken pipe" from some
canned shell script and wondered what they were doing wrong
since they didn't even know what a pipe was, let alone that
they were using one...

Exactly.  The documentation should probably state something like:

With piped input, head reads 2048 character blocks at a time.
If input extends beyond the last block needed by head,
the pipe is intentionally broken prematurely, and a

	Broken Pipe

message is issued.  Under these circumstances this is not an error.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, the following commands never issue a broken pipe
message with head (real bugs??):

	join
	man
	more
	nroff
	prmail
	sort
	whereis
	who
	Shell scripts
