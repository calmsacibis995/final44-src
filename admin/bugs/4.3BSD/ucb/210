Subject: systat iostat.c histogram() goof

Index: ucb/systat/iostat.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Someone mis-rounded.

Repeat-by:
	Inspection

Fix:
	Clearly that line of the histogram() function was intended to be

		register int v = (int)(val * scale + 0.5);

	not

		register int v = (int)(val * scale) + 0.5;

	wherein the +0.5 is guaranteed not to affect the result.

Chris
