Subject: no lastlog file shouldn't mean never logged in
Index: ucb/finger.c 4.3BSD
Date: Mon, 09 May 88 02:45:06 PDT
From: Craig Leres <leres@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU>

Description:
	Version 5.10 of finger claims that a user has never logged
	in if it can't open the lastlog file. It might be desirable
	(for security) to either not have a lastlog file or to make
	the lastlog file not readable by group guest and also make
	fingerd setuid and setgid to guest.
	
Repeat-By:
	Remove the lastlog file (or make it inaccessable as described
	above) and finger (or remote finger) a user; finger will say
	the user has never logged in when it fact it doesn't really know.

Fix:
	Make a distinction between no lastlog and never having logged
	in; i.e. if there's no lastlog file, don't say anything.
