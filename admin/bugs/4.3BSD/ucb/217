Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) vi's ZZ command sometimes doesn't write (w/fix)
Index: 	ucb/ex/ex_io.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	vi's ZZ command sometimes doesn't write a changed file back to disk.

Repeat-By:
	* Do a "cat /usr/pub/ascii > a"
	* Do a "vi a"
	* Do a "d5d"
	* Do a ":w b"
	* Do a "ZZ"
	...and note that files a and b are not the same.

Fix:
	Not tested too thoroughly, but there's always hope.
	Your line numbers will vary.
