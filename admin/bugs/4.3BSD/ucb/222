Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) dbx muffs ('s in run--somewhat fixed fix
Index: 	ucb/dbx/scanner.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	An earlier bug report noted that if under dbx, you, for example
		run find . ( -name alpha -o -name beta ) -print
	the '(' and everything that follows it is silently tossed on the floor.
	The report gave a bogus fix which caused redirections in runs, a la
		run find . -print > /tmp/results
	to stop working.

Fix:
	Maybe this one will work better.  It's still not 100% right; if you
		run whatever a (b) c
	the arguments "a", "(b", ")", and "c" are passed to "whatever".
