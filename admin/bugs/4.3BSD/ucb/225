Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) sccs muffs files that don't end with \n
Index: 	ucb/sccs 4.3BSD

Description:
	If a file does not end with a newline, sccs will happily create
	an SCCS file for it and will unhappily grumble when you try to
	edit the file.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Tue Jun 21 20:07:36 1988
	elsie$ mkdir SCCS
	elsie$ awk 'BEGIN { printf "Hello, world" ; exit }' > results
	elsie$ cat results
	Hello, worldelsie$ sccs admin -iresults results
	No id keywords (cm7)
	elsie$ rm results
	elsie$ sccs edit results
	1.1
	new delta 1.2
	ERROR [SCCS/s.results]: premature eof (co5)
	elsie$ cat results
	results: No such file or directory
	elsie$ chmod +w SCCS/s.results
	elsie$ echo >> SCCS/s.results
	elsie$ sccs get results
	1.1
	ERROR [SCCS/s.results]: corrupted file (co6)
	elsie$ exit

Fix:
	"Doctor, it hurts when I do that!"
	"Don't do that!"

	Well heck, *I* didn't. . .it's those darned MIT folks with their
	XV11R2 tape.  Here I wanted to sccs all the files as received on
	their tape, then edit in their fixes; I couldn't since some of the
	lisp files (take lib/CLX/dependent.l, please) don't end in newlines.

	Hard to say what the "right" fix is here; at the very least a note in
	the man page seems called for.
