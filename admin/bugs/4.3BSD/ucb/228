The problem is a bug in the 4.3BSD `vi' program: in ex.h, we have
the declaration

	var	char	genbuf[MAXBSIZE];

while in ex_io.c we have the following:

	if (fstat(io, &statb) < 0)
		bsize = LBSIZE;
	else {
		bsize = statb.st_blksize;
		if (bsize <= 0)
			bsize = LBSIZE;
	}
	ignore(append(getfile, addr2));

The routine getfile() reads text from descriptor `io' into the buffer
`genbuf', asking for `bsize' bytes each time.  If the st_blksize is
greater than the MAXBSIZE of the system on which vi was compiled, it
reads past the end of the buffer `genbuf' and clobbers random variables.

Index: ucb/ex/ex_io.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	ex carelessly assumes that file block sizes are <= MAXBSIZE.

Repeat-by:
	Using NFS or equivalent, edit a file with a blocksize of 16KB
	from a machine with a MAXBSIZE of 8KB.

Fix:
	change the code near the top of rop2() from

		bsize = statb.st_blksize;
		if (bsize <= 0)
			bsize = LBSIZE;

	to

		bsize = statb.st_blksize;
		if (bsize <= 0)
			bsize = LBSIZE;
		if (bsize > MAXBSIZE)
			bsize = MAXBSIZE;

	The second statement could be an `else if', but this protects
	against configuration errors in ex_tune.h (making LBSIZE > MAXBSIZE).
