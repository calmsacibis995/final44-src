Subject: non-interactive ex not doing source properly
Index: 	ucb/ex/* 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
One of our users reports the following bug, which I have verified using the
version of vi compiled on violet from source taken from monet on July 20 (the
newest pieces are dated Jan 2, 1988).  Basically, ex run non-interactively
does not source files correctly.  See below for an example.

The user actually did things a
bit differently.  He did the entire thing interactively with the command
	ex myfile << 'EOT'
and ended his input with the line
	'EOT'

This caused the file testb to be executed at the end and his output had
	BBCCAA(stuff)
on each line.  (see example below)

He says he used to get the expected (CCBBAA) results up until about a year
ago.  Our ex binary is dated 23 March 1987, but I have no idea what its
history is.

Thanks very much,

Repeat-By:
Suppose you have a script which contains:
	1,$ s/^/AA
	so testb
	1,$ s/^/CC
	wq

where testb contains:
	1,$ s/^/BB

Then the results of
	ex myfile < script

where myfile contains

	This is a practice
	file to see what
	we get.

Is:
	CCAAThis is a practice
	CCAAfile to see what
	CCAAwe get.
Thus, the changes from testb are not saved.
