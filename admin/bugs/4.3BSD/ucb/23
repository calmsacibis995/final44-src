Subject: rdist packet size

Index:  ucb/rdist/defs.h	4.3	Fix

Description: when transmitting over poor quality ethernets or the 
	arpanet, large packets are often lost.  For example, 
	I cannot rdist from zooey to calder because packets 
	are 1024 bytes long and do not get through
	at all.  However, packets of 512 bytes travel just fine.
	Note:  this is a repeat posting (the previous was messed up!!!, but
	acctepted)
Repeat-By:
	from say, calder:
	    % ping zooey 512 10
	    % ping zooey 1024 10
	    % ping a.cs.cmu.edu 56
	    % ping a.cs.cmu.edu 1024
Fix:	Make rdist/rcp intelligent about bad line quality.  Or add 
	    #undef BUFSIZ
	    #define BUFSIZ 512
	to bin/rcp.c and ucb/rdist/defs.h
