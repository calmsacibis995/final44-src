Subject: logger(1) hiccups on % signs
Index: ucb/logger.c 4.3BSD

Description:
        Logger(1) mishandles messages containing % signs, treating them as
        though they were printf(3) conversion specifiers.  As a result,
        randomly-formatted strings are logged.
        Sometimes you can provoke a core dump. 
Repeat-By:
        logger -t testing -p user.info 
        here comes a % sign 
        here come two %% signs
        100%flood insurance 18%dairy cows 5%light bulbs
        ^D
Fix:
        Change 
            syslog(pri, buf);
        to  
            syslog(pri, "%s", buf);
