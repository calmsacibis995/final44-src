Subject: rdist can't handle hard links when target directory is specified

Description:
	Rdist has trouble doing an "install" to a target directory that
	is different from the source directory. This is because it
	doesn't appear to know the target filespec of the file it's
	trying to hard link from.

	It just happens to work ok when the source and target
	directories are the same.

Repeat-By:
	Setup directories on two different filesystems

	    % mkdir /u1/test
	    % mkdir /u2/test
	    % cd /u1/test
	    % touch imhard
	    % ln imhard metoo
	    % cd /tmp
	    % cat >distfile
	    /u1/test -> localhost
		    install /u2/test;
	    ^D
	    % rdist
	    installing: /u1/test/imhard
	    installing: /u1/test/metoo
	    rdist: localhost:can't link /u2/test/metoo to /u1/test/imhard

	Notice that that source of the link (the 2nd file spec) is on
	the the wrong filesystem; since we're trying to update
	/u2/test, the source file should be /u2/test/imhard. The link
	fails because rdist is trying to do a cross device link.

	If the source and target directories are on the same filesystem
	on the same system, then /u2/test/metoo is incorrectly linked
	to /u1/test/imhard.

	If the two directories are on different systems, the error
	happens because /u1/test/imhard doesn't exist on the target
	system.
