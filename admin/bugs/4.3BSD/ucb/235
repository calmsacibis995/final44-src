Subject: Finger doesn't do the proper TELNET CR/LF mappings on output
Index: ucb/finger.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Finger doesn't properly handle the TELNET CR/LF mapping.  This means
	that the output from finger has spurious \r's in it.  Ordinarily,
	these are invisible, but they can mess up other programs (like
	more).

Repeat-By:
	testit% finger @some-host > /tmp/f.out
	testit% vi /tmp/f.out
	(look at all the ^M's at the end of the lines)
	(make your window smaller than the number of lines in /tmp/f.out)
	testit% more /tmp/f.out
	(note that when you hit <space> to see the next screen, you end up
	with a blank line in your output.  There was data on that blank
	line...)
Fix:
	Make finger do the proper TELNET CR/LF translation on the data
	it gets back from a network finger.  The diff to finger.c appears
	below.  It may be possible to clean the code up a bit.  Note that
	I haven't thought about whether or not the interaction with more is
	also a bug on more's part.

	Making finger do all the TELNET processing (including options
	processing and the like) is left as an exercise for the reader... (-:
