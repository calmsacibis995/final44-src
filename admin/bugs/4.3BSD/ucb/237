Subject: rdist sometimes does not set group id properly
Index: 	ucb/rdist/server.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When the a directory's group is different than a user's login
	group, and the user has a file in that directory whose group
	is the login group and the user is not listed in /etc/group
	as being in his login group, then the file created by rdist
	will have the same group as the directory, not the one intended.

Repeat-By:
	Create the scenario above.

Fix:
