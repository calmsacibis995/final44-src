Dave,

There is a bug in version 3.7 of the vi editor that when the program
receives a hangup prevents it from removing its temporary files after
a successful preserve.  It might also be causing the editor to get
caught in an infinite loop, but I'm not certain.

The routine waitfor() in ex_unix.c seems to have been modified in such
a way that the external rpid is always -1, when it should normally
equal pid.  Rpid is checked in preserve() to see if the preserve program
terminated normally, and it ends up deciding something went wrong when
rpid doesn't equal pid.  The current waitfor() is:

/*
 * Wait for the process (pid an external) to complete.
 */
waitfor()
{
	int stat = 0;

	do {
		rpid = wait(&stat);
		if (rpid == pid)
			status = stat;
	} while (rpid != -1);
	status = (status >> 8) & 0377;
}

The corrected version should look something like:

waitfor()
{
	int stat = 0;
	int lrpid;

	rpid = -1;
	do {
		lrpid = wait(&stat);
		if (rpid == -1 || lrpid == pid) {
			rpid = lrpid;
			status = stat;
		}
	} while (lrpid != -1);
	status = (status >> 8) & 0377;
}

Also, in onhup(), an unnecessary call is made to setexit(), which might
be the source of a loop (again I'm guessing).

I have not had much luck in the past reporting bugs to the UC campus.  There
seems to be a bug in the bug reporting program that causes it to reject all
bugs as having the wrong format.  (Someone must have thought this was a good
joke.)  I hope you'll know what to do with this.

-Greg
