Subject: Some routines in Mail use variables before they're set
Index: 	ucb/Mail/optim.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	A couple of routines in Mail use pointer variables which have
	never been set.

	One of the routines (rename) is never used.  The code that uses
	it has #ifdef OPTIM around it but is also commented out.  Mail
	is badly in need of "lint"ing.  There are a lot of unused
	variables and functions, a lot of functions which are not properly
	declared, a lot of routines whose return value is never used, etc..
Fix:
	Here's the patch; line numbers may differ for 4.3BSD.
