Subject: 4.3BSD (and Unicos 5) ftp bug +Fix
Index: ucb/ftp 4.3BSD

I just fixed a minor but annoying bug in 4.3BSD's FTP.  Just tried it on
snq1, and its FTP displays the same bug.

Symptom:  In FTP, if the connection is lost AND verbose mode is off,
		FTP goes into an infinite loop and can't be interrupted.
		(It catches SIGINT and returns to the loop.  SIGQUIT works tho.)

Fix:	In ftp.c/getreply(), the "if (c == EOF) {" code contains a block like

		if (verbose) {
			printf ...
			fflush ...
			code = 421;
			return (4);
		}
	}

	this should clearly read

		if (verbose) {
			printf ...
			fflush ...
		}
		code = 421;
		return (4);
	}
