	Subject: ^Z in ex with autowrite should warn
	Index: 	ucb/ex 4.3BSD

	>>>resending.....
	
Description:
	In the vi/ex editor (from ex mode) if you have autowrite set and
	do a ^Z it stops, but does *NOT* write the file.  The command "stop"
	does work, but is more of a pain to use.  The documentation claims
	this is intentional; thou IMHO it's a bug.  Assuming there IS some
	valid reason for this, then I say ex should say:
		"WARNING: changes NOT saved!"
Repeat-By:
	ex file
	set aw
	a
	foo
	.
	^Z
	cat file
Fix:
	When ex is about to stop (in ^Z sig-handler maybe) it should
	check, and print above warning   if (modified_flag && autowrite_flag)
	are both set.
