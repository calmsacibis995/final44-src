Subject: rdist -v and symbolic links
Index: 	ucb/rdist/server.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If you don't have write permission in a directory
	and any of the files are symbolic links, verifying
	(rdist -v) will fail.  Anyone should be able to
	verify.  Am I wrong or am I wrong?
Repeat-By:
	We had replaced /bin/chfn with a symbolic link.
	When we ran "rdist -vc /bin pacific" as mortals we got
		rdist: pacific.nprdc.mil:/bin/rdist010578: Permission denied
	The client rdist queries about /bin/chfn and learns that
	it is a symbolic link, so the client tells the server
	to COMPARE|VERIFY.  The server rdist tries to make a symbolic
	link (for the COMPARE).  This seems like a mistake, since
	we're really only VERIFYing.
Fix:
	Don't make the symbolic link if VERIFYing.
