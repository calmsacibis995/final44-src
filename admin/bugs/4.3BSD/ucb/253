	SunOS 4.0 + "General-Hy patch"

Description:
	The SunOS 4.0 vi(1) manual page says that

	     The editor recognizes the environment variable EXINIT  as  a
	     command  (or  list of commands separated by | characters) to
	     run when it starts up.  If this variable is  undefined,  the
	     editor checks for startup commands in the file ~/.exrc file,
	     which you must own.

	But ex and vi will still check for ~/.exrc if EXINIT is present
	(but empty).

	Running ex without an EXINIT variable (2>>>> above), the contents of
	~/.exrc (1>>>> above) take effect (3>>>> above).  If EXINIT is present
	and non-null (4>>>> above), ~/.exrc is ignored (as can be seen by
	comparing 5>>>> above to 3>>>> above).  If EXINIT is present but is
	null (6>>>> above), ~/.exrc is used (7>>>> above, which is the same as
	3>>>> above).
