Subject: msgs resets .msgsrc to zero wrongly
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	When I say "msgs" I occasionally get the error message
	  Warning: bounds have been reset
	and my .msgsrc ends up with 1 in it.  I believe that this
	happens when someone is posting a new message at the same
	moment and /usr/msgs/bounds is briefly truncated.
Repeat-By:
	Not easy, since I think this is a race condition.
Fix:
	msgs should distinguish a truncated bounds from a zero bounds;
	in the former case it should just wait a few seconds and try
	again.
