Subject: messages truncated while reading mail
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	While reading mail with /usr/ucb/Mail, occasionally it stops in the
	middle of a message (in the middle of a line, in fact) and gives the
	ampersand prompt.  Thereafter, retyping the message (with t or T)
	just shows the first line of the header.  Moving to another message
	and back doesn't fix this.  However, saving the message with s does
	save the complete text; also, exiting with x and starting over brings
	back the complete message.
Repeat-By:
	I'm sorry to say that this is hard to reproduce.  Re-reading the same
	message in a fresh copy of Mail generally works.  My impression is
	that it's more likely to happen with longer messages, but I'm not sure.
