Subject: Latest ctags bug
Index: ucb/ctags/C.c 4.3BSD +FIX
Date: Sun, 05 Mar 89 18:39:24 PST
From: Craig Leres <leres@helios.ee.lbl.gov>

Description:
	A macro define that has white space between the hash character
	and the define token is ignored by ctags.

	While I can't prove that such white space is legal, all known
	compilers accept it so I think that ctags should too.

Repeat-By:
	Create a C source with such a define:

		% echo "# define lose(x) (x / 0)" > lose.c
	
	Try to create a tags file:

		% rm -f tags ; ctags lose.c ; cat tags
		tags: No such file or directory

Fix:
	Redo hash_entry() to eat white space between the hash and
	define token. (The context diff is based on my ctags bug report
	of January which has not be installed yet.)
