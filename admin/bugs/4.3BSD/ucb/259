Description:
	The PATH/shell combination used in handling commands resulting
	from SunOS 4.0[.1]'s rsh command can't be changed.  This means that
	users of /bin/sh, which only reads a "startup" file when being used
	interactively, must either specify full pathnames of commands that
	are in places not mentioned in rsh's default PATH, or place links
	to the commands in places that *are* in the default path (or create
	scripts or aliases that prepend PATH-setting magic to the commands
	rsh'd to remote systems--an approach not shown below).

	(This is also a problem for users of at least some versions of ksh--
	in particular it's a problem for users of the version we have here at
	elsie.  We understand that this isn't really a Sun problem since Sun
	doesn't provide ksh.)

	(This is also a problem with the version of MORE/bsd we're running
	here at elsie.)
