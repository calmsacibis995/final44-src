I am not sure where this should actually go.  Please do forward it the person
that can deal with it.
-----------
The "cont" command of the 4.3 dbx (for the vax 11/750) does not seem to work
in programs handling signals.  execution can not continue on interrupted
(SIGINT ?) programs either.  These would be observed if, for instance, dbx were
given itself to debug!  How do I get round this? or what am I doing wrong?
Is it not possible/predictable to "ptrace" a program that is "ptracing" another?
