Subject: Using grep with filename metacharacters in files list instead of
         listing each file separately did not work.
Index: ucb/grep 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

'which grep' indicated: /usr/ucb/grep
also used in an attempt to track down the problem: /bin/grep

Description:
I was using the following script:
#
# cnavp11a - cnavp11d require cnboot11
#
foreach file (cnavp11a cnavp11b cnavp11c cnavp11d)
  ~jags/sim29kpcv/sim29k -dr -r cnboot11 -avp $file > sim.$file &
  wait
end
#
# all other AVPs use cnboot
#
foreach file (cnavp1 cnavp2 cnavp3 cnavp4 cnavp5 cnavp6\
              cnavp7 cnavp8 cnavp9 cnavp10 cnavp11e cnavp12\
              cnavp13 cnavp13a cnavp14 cnavp15a cnavp15b\
              cnavp15c cnavp15d cnavp15e cnavp15f cnavp18)
  ~jags/sim29kpcv/sim29k -dr -r cnboot -avp $file > sim.$file &
  wait
end
#
# check for termination message -- successful or failure?
#
foreach file (sim.cnavp*)
  grep -l "failure termination" $file > sim.fails
end

********************************************************************
The first two foreach loops worked as expected; the third one did
not work at all, with some experimentation, it was discovered that
the metacharacter expansion was indeed performed, but none of the
commands were executed.  By changing the (sim.cnavp*) to a list
of all the file names, I got the script to work correctly.
