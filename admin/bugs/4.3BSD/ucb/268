Gee, I'll bet you're seeing a lot of these security things nowadays.

The problem I have noted is not really a new bug, just an insight into
an old one.  The oft-flogged vi/ex "feature" of executing a string in a
file being loaded if the tag "vi:" or "ex:" is found opens up an
interesting possibility for Trojan horse exploitation.  A devious
naughty person could embed a string like "ex:!balloons:" in a
configuration file for some "carrier" software.  The software would be
distributed (for example) in tar format; when unpacked it would be set
up with ownership and permissions such that working with it would be
difficult if the installer is not root.  So the installer su's, begins
editing the configuration file to define "BSD4" or whatever, and BINGO
the editor happily runs the shell script "balloons", which does all
sorts of rotten things.

We noticed this because recently a user was added to our machine with user
name "flex".  The password file thus contained an "ex::33:", which of
course causes vi to attempt to do "33" as a command.  I think I'll change
the user name.

This has probably been noted before, but I figured I'd point it out anyway.
