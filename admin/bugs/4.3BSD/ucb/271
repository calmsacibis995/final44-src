Subject: vi does not set modified status on :%d
Index:  ucb/vi 4.3BSD

Description:
        vi does set modified status on its buffer when you delete *all* the
        lines using the last-line command delete.  Thus when you exit, the
        file is not changed.  Bug exists in at least 4.3BSD and SunOS4.0.

Repeat-By:
        vi filewithseverallines
        :f 
                        line n of n 
        :%d             buffer is changed
        :f 
                        line 1 of 1 
        ZZ              buffer is not written, even :q doesn't complain
                        file is not changed
