	Note the

	in the line marked ">>>>" above, which is turned into an acute accent
	by troff.

Note:
	My guess is that the backslash is there in an attempt to prevent funny
	behavior on lines that begin with apostrophes, yes?  Better might be
	to put a
		\&
	at the start of lines beginning with apostrophes.
