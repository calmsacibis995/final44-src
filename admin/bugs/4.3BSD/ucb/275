Subject: telnet doesn't close socket when connect() fails
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When connect() in ucb/telnet/commands.c fails, the socket
	isn't closed after trying the last address in the h_addr_list.
	After attempting (NOFILE - 3) such connections, telnet will
	fail with the error "unknown host" due to a gethostbyname()
	failure caused by the inability to talk to a nameserver (or
	open /etc/hosts, etc.).

Repeat-By:
	yes 'open <host> <port>' | telnet

	where <host> is a host that will refuse a connection on
	the given <port>.

Fix:
	from 4.3BSD-tahoe:
