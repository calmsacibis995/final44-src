Subject: rdist botches hard links properly when given an "install" directory
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Postulate a command using the "opt_dest_name" field of the "install"
	command, such as:

		rdist -c /usr/src/local/dmd icsib:~eric/src/dmd

	This correctly renames files so that they are in ~eric/src instead of
	/usr/src/local.  However, if the source directory contains hard links
	(e.g., include/blit.h == include/dmd.h), the link on the target
	machine is made using the pathname on the _source_ machine.
Repeat-By:
	From okeeffe, issue the command:

		rdist -c /usr/src/local/dmd/include somehost:dmd-include

	Make sure that "somehost" doesn't have a /usr/src/local/dmd/include,
	or make sure that your home directory is on a different disk partition,
	so that the hard link will fail.
