Subject: Finger typo can cause incorrect name match
Index: 	ucb/finger.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	All versions of the finger program I've seen contain a typo
	that can cause incorrect name matching. In the 4.3 version
	(the original as well as version 5.11 from uunet.uu.net),
	I've never seen this cause a problem, but a minor change
	in the Ultrix version combines with the bug to allow a
	remote finger of all accounts, not just those logged in.

Repeat-By:
	On an Ultrix 3.1 host, run "finger @".

Fix:

	Apply this diff to finger.c version 5.11.
