Subject: vi/ex doesn't get last tag entry
Index: 	ucb/ex 4.3BSD

Description:
	vi/ex will not get the last tag in "tags" if the number of tags
	is greater than 8 and less than 16.
Repeat-By:
	Install the tags file below as "tags" and then say
		vi tags
		:ta viewtrans
	and you will get "no such tag".  If you say ":ta tray" it will
	try to go to tray.  If, however, you delete the viewtrans tag,
	":ta tray" will get "no such tag".  This will continue to
	happen as long as there are more than 8 tags in this file (I
	have not tried it for more than 10 tags overall).

	Tags file:
		Mraycast	raycast.c	/^main(ac, av)$/
		freechildren	memory.c	/^freechildren(rp)$/
		newray	memory.c	/^newray()$/
		rayhit	rayhit.c	/^rayhit(pray, obj)$/
		rayshade	rayshade.c	/^rayshade(rp, obj)$/
		readobj	raycast.c	/^readobj(file)$/
		shade	rayshade.c	/^shade(rp, obj)$/
		sray	rayshade.c	/^sray(parent, obj)$/
		tray	rayshade.c	/^tray(parent, obj, refr)$/
		viewtrans	raycast.c	/^viewtrans(rp, x, y, scale)$/
