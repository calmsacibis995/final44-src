	Bug 1) The "~" operator (case invert) doesn't take a count.  It
would be nice to say 5~, and invert 5 characters.

	Bug 2) If I have my wrap margin set to anything other than 0 (i.e.,
autowrap is on), and I yank a bunch of text (a sentence, for example) and try
putting it, vi tries to autowrap the text coming out of the put command, and
really gets confused, dropping half of the characters and interpreting others
as commands.

	Complaint 1) I can delete into a buffer within a macro, but I cannot
yank into a buffer.  This seems inconsistent.

	Complaint 2) I forget what you suggested that I objected so
strenuously to in Baltimore, but I still object to it.

	Complaint 3) The substitution metacharacters "~", "\l", "\L", "\u",
and "\U" are undocumented - I learned about them in the Nutshell book.
