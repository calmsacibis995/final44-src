Subject: Finger
Index: ucb/finger 4.3BSD

Description:
	All versions of the finger program I've seen contain a typo
	that can cause incorrect name matching. In the 4.3 version
	(the original as well as version 5.11 from uunet.uu.net),
	I've never seen this cause a problem, but a minor change
	in the Ultrix version combines with the bug to allow a
	remote finger of all accounts, not just those logged in.

Repeat-By:
	On an Ultrix 3.1 host, run "finger @".

Fix:

	Apply this diff to finger.c version 5.11.

  			;
! 		if (*name2 == 0)
  			return (1);
  	}
  	return (0);

	Any idea what the problem here is? I'd expect a network failure
	to be a recoverable error under normal conditions. Thanks for
	your help.
