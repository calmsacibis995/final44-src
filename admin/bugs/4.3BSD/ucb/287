Subject: rdist will not let you install a file (or directory) called "install"
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When you try use rdist to move a directory called "install" it
	complains with a syntax error

Repeat-By:
	% rdist -f - << 'END'
	FILES= ( foo
	  install
	  bar )
	$(FILES) -> host
	'END'

	the above will cause rdist to complain of a syntax error on line 2.

	This was verified with the rdist on monet.berkeley.edu on 3/5/90.
