Subject: telnet SIGPIPE infinite loop
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When the telnet program gets a SIGPIPE signal it longjmps and
	writes to stderr.  If stderr is itself a broken pipe we get
	a infinite loop. This bug can happen if you start telnet under
	a terminal emulator program and the emulator dies without killing
	the telnet.
Repeat-By:
	Type the command "telnet localhost |& cat", kill the "cat" process, 
	and type a character at the telnet.
Fix:
	 Remove the signal handler for SIGPIPE before writting the 
	"Connection closed by foreign host.\n" message to stderr.
