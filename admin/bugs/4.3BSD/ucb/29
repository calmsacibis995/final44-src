Subject: gprof and man page differ 4.3BSD
Index: ucb/gprof 4.3BSD

Description:
	(This is the second time I've sent this in.  The last one was
	rejected.  Sorry if you've read it anyway.  This time,
	however, I have a diff listing of the fix.)

	The gprof man page states that the order of the output from
	gprof is
		simple summary (a la prof)
		complex summary
		function reference list
	However, as of 4.3, gprof has been changed to put out
		complex summary
		simple summary
		function reference list
	This is (a) annoying, (b) inconsistent, and (c) an unnecessary
	change.
Repeat-By:
	Compare the description in gprof(1) to the output of gprof.
Fix:
	The appropriate fix (and the easier one, I might add) is to
	change the source to follow the man page (no troffing
	required).  It requires the switching of two function calls
	(see diff below).  Think of it this way: If you want the
	complex summary in the old system, you only have to skip over a
	page or two.  That's all the new order has saved you.  However,
	in the new system, if you want the short summary (which is
	often very useful, since it pinpoints specific problem
	functions) you have to skip over reams of stuff.  The
	ergonomterics are clear!
