Subject: Short summary of the problem
Index: 	ucb/ftp/glob.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	If an "mput" is done but the filename given does not have any
	characters which would cause the "glob"ing to expand the name
	then ftp can core dump in mput() after transferring the file.
Repeat-By:
	ftp>open remotehost
	... login ...
	ftp>mput filename_with_no_expansion_characters

Fix:
	THe problem arises because once again, ftp is free()'ing 
	something which was never malloc()'d.  If glob() does not
	expand the input file name into something other than the
	string passed to it, a copy of the input pointer is returned.
	This pointer may be in either the stack or data space of the
	program and free()'ing it later may result in premature 
	program termination.

	Apply the patch below to glob.c and remake 'ftp'
