Subject: message from "mail -u user" command
Index: 	ucb/mail 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When I use "mail -u user" to read another users mail, I get the
	message "no mail" even if there is mail when I do not have read
	permission on the file.  I think that the message should be
	"permission denied" because I frequently have a need to read
	mail in another user's account in the same group as my account,
	but the permissions and group protection mysteriously change on
	the /usr/spool/mail/user file every so often.
