Subject: indent should handle ANSI C
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	In ANSI C, the old =<op> notation (like =+ for instance)
	that used to be equivalent to <op>= is gone.  But indent
	treats the ambiguous cases using the old syntax.  That's
	correct for old compilers, but there should be a switch
	to conform to the usage of new compilers.
Repeat-By:
	Given a test file such as
		foo(void) {
		    *out=*in;
		}
	indent will turn the middle line to
		    *out *= in;
