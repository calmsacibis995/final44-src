Subject: Mail doesn't notice /tmp full
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	I was reading my mail with /usr/ucb/mail and I wanted one
	message moved to mbox, so I didn't say "d" or "pre", and
	when I said "q" to exit mail, I saw "/: no room on device"
	and afterwards I found that the new message is indeed in
	mbox but the end of mbox has been truncated.  Mail should
	notice when its buffer file can't be written and refrain
	from destroying information in saved mail files.
	(This is on a Sun, btw, if it matters.)
