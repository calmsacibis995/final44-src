Subject: Mail/sendmail doesn't provide sender's full name sometimes
Index: ucb/Mail 4.3BSD

From: Stephen Gildea <gildea@alexander.bbn.com>

Description:

The Mail program doesn't pass a From: line to sendmail.  Sendmail
creates one, I don't know how.  Usually it includes the full name of
the sender in From line by looking it up in /etc/passwd.  However, if
the sender receives mail on another machine, so that their username
doesn't resolve in sendmail to a local name, sendmail doesn't realize
that the mail is originating locally and does not supply the full name.

Fix:

I would recommand that Mail, as the originator of the message, supply
a From line, and that sendmail confine itself to the job of
transporting the mail.  Of course, sendmail would have to check the
validity of the From line for security reasons, but it does that now
anyway.
