Subject: rdist gets confused in simple case
Index: ucb/rdist 4.3BSD

Description:
	Given a simple Distfile, e.g.,

		BINFILES =	(man)

		/usr/ucb/${BINFILES} -> (aris cgl)
			install /usr/ucb ;

	rdist gets confused and attempts to rmdir /usr/ucb.  If the
	number of files in BINFILES is greater than one, this does
	not happen.  If the install command is changed to

			install /usr/ucb/${BINFILES} ;

	this does not happen.

Repeat-By:
	See above
