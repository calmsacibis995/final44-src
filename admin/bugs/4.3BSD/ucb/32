Subject: man produces garbled cat files
Index: 	ucb/man.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When man uses nroff to format manual pages, it stores the
	output in man/cat?.  However, when it invokes nroff to do so,
	it allows nroff to use the default terminal, which includes
	specific escape sequences which can mess up other terminals.
	The "man" command should say "nroff -h -man -Tcrt" instead of
	just "nroff -h -man".
Repeat-By:
	Look at, say, /usr/man/cat3/random.3.  It has escape sequences
	to do half-line scrolling.  These happen to mess up avt
	terminals.  So try logging onto an avt terminal (or maybe even
	any ansii standard terminal -- avt's are the only ones of that
	type here) and saying "man 3 random".
Fix:
	Change /usr/src/ucb/man.c to use "nroff -Tcrt ..." whereever it
	uses "nroff" now (two #define's at the top are where this is, I
	belive).
