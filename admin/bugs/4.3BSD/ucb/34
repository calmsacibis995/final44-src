Subject: 'more' doesn't understand 'xn' type terminals (such as 'xterm')
Index:	ucb/more/more.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When you run 'more' on a terminal which has the 'eat newline'
	feature described by the 'xn' termcap capability, it can screw
	up and lose blank lines.

Repeat-By:
	Go to a terminal with the 'eat newline' feature; it's easy to
	see the problem when you use a window created by the 'xterm'
	terminal emulator of the X window system.  Run the C-shell
	command:

		% (repeat 80 -n echo a; repeat 2 echo '') | more

	(Substitute the appropriate screen width for '80' if you use
	something different.) Run the same command on a normal terminal
	and compare -- 'more' on the 'eat newline' terminal will lose
	the blank line.

Fix:
	'more' has no code to handle 'xn' terminals, but it's easy to
	add.  Make the following changes to 'more.c', in the
	declarations at the top and in the routines getline() and
	initterm():
