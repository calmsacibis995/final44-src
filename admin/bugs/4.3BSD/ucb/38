Subject: long lines in 'vi'

Index: ucb 4.3BSD

The version of 'vi' that I am running has a problem with displaying long lines.
For a long line (say 3 lines worth) the following happens:

1.	If the autowrap feature (of the terminal) is on, the second and third
	line is displayed with an extra blank line in between, while the
	first line is missing.  The cursor however is correctly placed where
	the line should have been in the first line.

2.	If the terminal autowrap feature is off, only the first line is
	displayed correctly, while the second and third lines are completely
	gone (not on the screen) with the exception of the last character
	on the second and third line...

Is there an initialization problem, or what?
