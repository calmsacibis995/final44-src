Subject: You can't back up in more
Index: 	ucb/more/more.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	More does not allow one to go back one or more pages.
	The (extremely cumbersome) way in which this must be
	simulated is either by invoking vi (which is s-l-o-w),
	or by finding out the current line number, subtracting
	approximately 30 lines from it in your mind, going back
	to the beginning of the file and skipping that many lines.

	The following addition to more will allow backing up
	one or more pages via the new 'b' or 'control-b' command.
	It is a no-op if the input is not a file (the bell is wrung).
	An optional numeric argument may precede the command, which
	specifies how may pages to back up.

	It turns out to be an EXTREMELY usefull feature.
