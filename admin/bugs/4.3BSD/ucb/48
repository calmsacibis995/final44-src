Subject: macros that fail in vi prevent subsequent yank
Index: 	ucb/vi 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When some vi macros fail because they ends with a space, and have been
	called at the end of a line, vi terminates the macro with a beep.
	However, it still thinks it is in macro mode, because if you try yy
	immediately after, you are told that you can't yank inside a macro.  The
	next time a macro successfully completes, the mode is set correctly.  In
	fact, when you elicit this error message, macro mode is reset correctly.
	The undo buffer is also retained as of the point when the failed macro was
	invoked, which means a subsequent undo many commands later removes many
	changes at once.
Repeat-By:
	In the .exinit file,
		(there are <esc> chars on the next line!)
		map , iaeab |map ; l
	In vi, having .so'ed the .exinit file,
		$,yy
