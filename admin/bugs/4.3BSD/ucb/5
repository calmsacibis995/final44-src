Subject: Locking on /usr/spool/mail
Index: ucb/Mail 4.3BSD
Date: 05 Sep 85 15:48:06 EDT (Thu)
From: wesommer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Description:
	/bin/mail under 4.3 uses flock(2) to properly lock the
mailboxes in /usr/spool/mail.  However, other mail readers (notably
/usr/ucb/Mail and MH) do not do this kind of locking.  This can
possibly lead to screwups if mail arrives as the spool file is
being deleted by the mail reader.
	Most of the screwups (occuring under 4.2, which did not use
flock) are probably caused by two or more /bin/mail processes stomping
on each other.  However, it is conceivable that other programs can
also cause this problem. 

Repeat-By:
	It's hard to recreate this; it appears to be highly
phase-of-moon dependant.  However, it can sting you once in a while.

Fix:
	Install the locking code used in /bin/mail into /usr/ucb/Mail.
