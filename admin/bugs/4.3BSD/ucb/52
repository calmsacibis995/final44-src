Subject: bug in vi "undo"

Description:
	"undo" in vi sometimes blows it trying to undo an "r" command

Repeat-By:

	Create two files -

		vi.bug.1 contains two lines:

			hello
			goodbye

		vi.bug.2 contains two lines:

			line #1
			line #2

	Execute the following commands:

		vi vi.bug.1
		:$r vi.bug.2
		u

	You should be left with the two lines "hello" and "goodbye",
	but you actually wind up with "hello" and "line #2".
