Subject:  brl-vgr Bug Report
Subject: New lines broken in local echo mode in telnet.
Index:	ucb/telnet.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	TELNET sends \n in local echo mode rather than \r\n when
	\r is typed.
Repeat-By:
	Get into mode 3, character at a time with local echo in
	telnet and then type \r.
Fix:
	The code that decides what the user really meant when he
	the input character is \n has a bug.  It checks to see if
	the user was in CRMOD which would imply that he really
	pressed return rather than linefeed.  The test however is
	defective in that mode 2 has CRMOD set as well.
