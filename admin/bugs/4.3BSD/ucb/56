Subject: "rlogin" doesn't accept the normal UNIX command syntax
Index: ucb/rlogin.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	"rlogin" does NOT permit you to say "rlogin -l <user> <host>";
	it REQUIRES you to put the <host> immediately after the command.
	name.  This is presumably a consequence of the code that causes
	"rlogin" to act as "rlogin host" when invoked as "host"; this
	is not, however, an excuse for this kind of behavior on its part.
Repeat-By:
	Try assuming that "rlogin" is a normal UNIX command with the normal
	UNIX command syntax, and get unpleasantly surprised.
Fix:
	Here's some changes to make it accept the 
	"rlogin -l <user> <host>" syntax as well as the
	"rlogin <host> -l <user>" and the "<host> -l <user>" syntax:
