Subject: vi bug when using 'p' or 'P' commands with wrapmagrin set
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Index:	ucb/vi 4.3BSD

Description:
	When a put of text at the end of a line forces the text across
	a line boundary determined by the wrapmargin setting vi starts
	executing portions of the put text as commands. By varying the
	wrap margin you can produce a great variety of results. Having
	numbering set only compounds the problems.

Repeat-By:
	Set wrapmargin to some value greater than zero.
	Delete some words of text into the unnamed buffer. Put these
	words at the end of a long line such that vi will be forced
	to do a wrapmargin when the text is put. To see textual
	commands executed include some commands in the deleted and
	put text (ie. J, ., M) and play with the wrapmargin setting.
