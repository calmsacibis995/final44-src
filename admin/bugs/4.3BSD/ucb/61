Subject: tset may not correctly reset terminal window size
Index: ucb/tset/tset.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	tset does not correctly reset the terminal window size when a
new terminal type is specified.
Repeat-By:
	Execute the following csh commands on a terminal which has its
TERM and TERMCAP environment variables already set.

	setenv TERMCAP /etc/termcap
	setenv TERM <some terminal with a different number of lines>
	eval `tset -s`
	stty everything

stty will report the old rather than the new number of lines on the
screen.
