Subject: route-addr syntax
Index: ucb/Mail 4.3BSD

Description:
	Mail doesn't parse ruote-addr syntax correctly.

Repeat-By:
	From csh:

	% echo test | mail "<@a,@b,@c>"

	and observe the message you receive from the MAILER-DAEMON
	The addresses is being broken up into <@a @b @c> as if
	this were a comma separated list of users, instead of a route.
