Subject: Ungraceful dbx exit
Index: ucb/dbx 4.3BSD

Description:
        If dbx does not see the symbol table information, because a file
        was not compiled with the -g option, it dies ungracefully with:
internal error:  reference through nil pointer line 119 file languages.c

        This is not a feature.

Repeat-By:
        Compile a c program without the -g option.  Type dbx a.out.  At the
        (dbx) prompt type trace <\n>. 

Fix:
	Change the error message to Invalid symbol table  information or
            internal error.
