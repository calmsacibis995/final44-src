Subject: tset loses TERMCAP variable
Index: ucb 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When the TERM environment variable contains a name not in /etc/termcap,
	tset can't find it.

Repeat-By:
	I have my own termcap entry for a hp9837 (bobcat workstation); the net
	effect of the login sequence is:

		if ($TERM == hp9837) setenv TERMCAP ~/.termcap
		eval `tset -s`

	Which replaces the TERMCAP environment variable with the actual TERMCAP
	entry.  The next time tset is called, it can't find the termcap entry
	for the terminal, i.e.:

		% tset
		Type hp9837 unkown

Fix:
	Change it to use the TERMCAP entry first, then remove it and try to
	find it in /etc/termcap.
