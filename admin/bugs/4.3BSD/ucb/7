Subject: Mail's write command does not strip headers correctly
Index: 	ucb/Mail/cmd2.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Mail's write command, which is supposed to strip the header
	from a message before writing it to a file, actually just
	deletes the first line of the message.
Fix:

< 		t = mp->m_lines - 2;
< 		readline(mesf, linebuf);

> 		while (t-- > 0) {
> 			readline(mesf, linebuf);
> 			if (blankline(linebuf))
> 				break;
> 		}
