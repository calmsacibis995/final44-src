Subject: Sendbug 
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Index: ucb/sendbug 4.3BSD

Description: Sendbug write-protects the template file so you can't do a :w
	 from vi. Since you can never change the template, the file
	 is unchanged and you can't submit the error report. I know you
	 guys would rather not hear bad news but...

Repeat-By:
	Procedure to repeat the problem. Type sendbug, modify the template,
	and try to exit vi
Fix:
	Put a "chmod +w $TEMP" into the script before you enter vi.
