Subject: The c optimizer makes "~" escapes break in rlogin
Index: ucb/rlogin.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The C optimizer treats characters as ints in comparisons, which
	causes rlogin comparisons for beginning of line to fail when they
	should not. The "fix" below ensures that only the low byte is
	significant, although the real bug and fix should be in the C
	optimizer.
Repeat-By:
	Run rlogin, compiled with the "-O" option of cc, to other hosts
	and try "~^Z" many times. Sometimes, the value of "c" in "writer()"
	will have nonzero bits in bits 31-16-- leftover garbage on the
	stack. The (optimized) comparisons for "bol" incorrectly use these
	bits and fail.
Fix:

	The workaround I sent you doesn't work after all. I'm just going
to remove the "-O" for rlogin and forget about it.
