Subject: Missing header file for 'pdx'
Index: ucb/pascal/px/h02opcs.h 4.3BSD

Description:
	If it becomes necessary to increase the kernel stack size by 
	increasing UBPAGES (found in /usr/src/sys/vax/machparam.h) you are
	unable to recompile 'pdx' because there is a missing include file.
	The file /usr/src/ucb/pascal/pdx/machine/pxops.h has in it a line:
		#include "../px/h02opcs.h"
	The file "../px/h02opcs.h" does NOT exist and the recompile of 'pdx'
	grinds to a swift end.
Repeat-By:
	Try to recompile 'pdx'.
Fix:
	Send a copy of /usr/src/ucb/pascal/px/h02opcs.h to those requesting it.
