Subject: script doesn't output final "script done on ..." line
Index: 	ucb/script.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Script does not output the final ("script done on ...") line
	into the typescript file.

	The additional sleep(1) is to allow the "Script started, ..."
	message to be printed in its entirety.  Without it, the fixtty()
	call immediately following sets the terminal into RAW mode which
	causes part (or all) of this message to not be displayed.
	A possible kernel bug?
Fix:

< 	(void) fclose(fscript);
< 	(void) close(master);
< 	exit(0);
