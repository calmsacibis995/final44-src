Subject: dbx evaluator missing implementation of ">="
Index: 	ucb/dbx/eval.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The arithmetic relations defined in the evaluator include
	"=" "!=" ">" ">=" "<" and "<=".  All of these were implemented
	in eval() except ">=" for integers and floats, which were
	simply omitted by oversight.

Repeat-By:
	% dbx a.out
	(dbx) stop in foo if bar >= baz
	(dbx) run
	internal error: eval: bad op 32
	%

Fix:
	patch file follows ----
