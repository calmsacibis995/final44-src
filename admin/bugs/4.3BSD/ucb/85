Subject: dbx could be smarter
Index: ucb/dbx 4.3BSD

Description:
	Dbx is not very good at finding the correct instance of a
	variable.
Repeat-By:
	Take the following C program:
		main() {
		int foo;

		foo = 1;
		func();
		}

		func() {
		int foo;

		foo = 2;
		}
	Using dbx on this program and setting the following two
	breakpoints:
		stop in main if foo == 1
		stop in func if foo == 2
	will result in dbx choosing func.foo in both instances, rather
	than choosing main.foo in the first instance.
