While looking at the vms changes you made to ex, I noticed a small
bug that has crept into ex_io.c in gscan():

	/*
	 * Scan genbuf for shell metacharacters.
	 * Set is union of v7 shell and csh metas.
	 */
	gscan()
	{
	#ifndef	vms
		register char *cp;

		for (cp = genbuf; *cp; cp++)
			if (any(*cp, "~{[*?$`'\"\\"))
			if (any(*cp, "~{[*?$`'\"\\"))
				return (1);
		return (0);
	#else
		return 0;	/* Never have meta-characters in vms */
	#endif
	}

The redundant test on line 285 should be removed.

I also noticed that you ifdef'ed out the magic number test in rop() for
vms. If you're interested, I can give you the code fragment I put into
more (under Eunice) to let it recognize vms executables. (Unfortunately,
vms object files don't have a magic number.)
