Since this applies to the software on ucbvax etc and not the 4.3 source
I figured it would be better to mail it.

Subject: more fails to print files that are shorter than 4 bytes
Index: src/ucb/more/more.c 4.3

Description:
	When trying more on files that are shorter than 4 bytes, more
	fails to print the contents.
Repeat-By:
	Create a small (4 byte or less) file.

	echo 12 >foo
	more foo

	Nothing is printed (should get 123).	
Fix:
	on files that have less than sizeof(magic) the offset in stdio will
	be less than sizeof(magic) so the fseek back will fail, dropping the
	first bytes in the file.
