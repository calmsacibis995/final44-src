Description:
	Mail does not handle fowarding correctly. If i send mail to
	an account on system1 to a person on system1 and that person
	has his mail forwarded to system2(via .forward) but has no
	login on system2, i get a mail message back from the
	MAILER_DAEMON saying that mail could not be sent because
	person@system2 does not exist.

Repeat-By:
	Doing what i say above.

Fix:
	Trace the mail or check if the login exists on the other system.
