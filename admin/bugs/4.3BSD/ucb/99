Subject: rlogin bug
Index: ucb/rlogin.c 4.3BSD

rlogin to any machine with:

% rlogin host -e

then type ^@^D (that's: null, followed by control-D), and you'll promptly
lose your connection.

This sort of thing is very normal, especially when using emacs remotely
(and hence the -e, so ~'s, and all chars, are passed through to the emacs).
