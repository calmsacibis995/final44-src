Subject: diff3 sometimes doesn't print differences
Index: 	usr.bin/diff3/diff3.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Diff3 will sometimes not print one of the differing lines.
	This seems to occur when the differing lines are preceeded
	by identical lines.
Repeat-By:
	Do the following sequence of commands

		% echo 'x' > a ; echo 'a' >> a
		% echo 'x' > b ; echo 'b' >> b
		% echo 'x' > c ; echo 'c' >> c
		% diff3 a b c

	What you SHOULD see is

		====3
		1:2c
		  a
		2:2c
		  b
		3:2c

	What you ACTUALLY see

		====3
		1:2c
		2:2c
		  b
		3:2c
		  c

	The line showing the difference of file a is missing.
