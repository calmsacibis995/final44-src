Subject: percent signs not allowed in phone numbers
Index: 	usr.bin/tip/acu.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Percent signs are not allowed in phone numbers, as documented in
	remote(5).
Repeat-By:
	Include a percent sign in a phone number for a ventel modem (or
	some other that uses % to indicate a pause) and try the number.
	The % will not be sent to the modem, and will delimit the number.
	For example, 5551212%234 will be interpreted as two numbers:
	5551212 and 234.
Fix:
	diff acu.c.ORIG acu.c
	72c72
	< 			for (phnum = cp; any(*cp, "0123456789-*=K"); cp++)
	---
	> 			for (phnum = cp; any(*cp, "0123456789%-*=K"); cp++)
Comment:
	It would probably be wiser to search for the correct delimiter,
	rather than just take any unknown character as a delimiter.
