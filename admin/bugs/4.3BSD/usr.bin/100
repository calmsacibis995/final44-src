DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
In two places in the file diffdir.c, diff calls first
pr and then itself when invoked with the -r option (recursive).
Diff sets up execv argument lists for pr and diff, and
then does the exec twice:  the second time through arg0 is
the correct "/bin/pr" or "/bin/diff".  The first time execv
is called, however, it is called with an arg0 of "/pr" or
"/diff":  the execv therefore fails.

Here is the relevant code:

	execv ( diff+4, diffargs ) ;
	execv ( diff, diffargs ) ;

It is surmised that Berkeley originally had pr and diff stashed
somewhere in the second level of a filesystem with a two-letter
name, such as "/va/pr":  calling execv with diff+4 would get
you "pr" as arg0, and the call would work the first time.  Of
course, you still get the overhead of the second execv call,
and the second call would also work.  Since pr is now /bin/pr,
the first call fails but the second works (the first call
comes out as "/pr ...").  Execv is still called twice:
this is cheesy code.
SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
Insert debugging statements to have diff tell you every time
it issues an execv, recompile and test.  Make sure that the
Makefile has correct pathnames in it (otherwise, you can end
up with your changed diff invoking /bin/diff and not itself...).
SUGGESTED FIX:
A)	Quick fix: 
#ifdef notdef
	execv(diff+4, diffargs);
#endif
	execv(diff, diffargs);
	....
and 
#ifdef notdef
	execv(pr+4, prargs);
#endif
	execv(pr, prargs);
	....
(Search for execv in diffdir.c:  it's only used in two places.)

B)	Better fix:
In the switch for the options, diff increments the rflag when it
gets the -r option.  At that time, diff should find out where it
lives and stuff that pathname into the global var "diff".  It
should do the same thing for the -l option (set the variable
"pr" to pr's correct pathname).  It should not make assumptions
about where it lives;  if it is invoked as "/foo/garbage/diff"
it should call itself as "/foo/garbage/diff".  Probably it
should just do a "getcwd" call for itself, and should just use 
the pr in its search path;  then IF the call fails (which it
should test for), then and only then should it attempt to
guess where pr lives.
OTHER COMMENTS:  Pat Kane reported this bug in conjunction with
the Makefile bug noted elsewhere.
This bug exists in the original code for BSD from which UTX was
ported (see duplicate bug report in bug.utx).

NOTE:  This probably also lives in Secunix, too (UTX/32S).

this has been corrected, recompiled and installed on
the vax (ernie).

'pr' use to be in  "/usr/bin/pr"  so the exec of "pr+4"
and the "pr"  first tries  "/bin/pr" followed by "/usr/bin/pr"
