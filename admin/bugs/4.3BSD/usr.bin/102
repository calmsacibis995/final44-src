SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
tbl '\_' data improperly handled

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500

MODULE NAME:
tbl command

BUG PORTED TO UTX?
yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The '\_' data construct in the tbl data section of a table is not properly
handled by tbl.  '\_' is supposed to draw short horizontal lines, as wide
as the contents of the column.  This works fine for columns with format
specification 'l' (left justified data), however, it does not work at all for
the 'a' (ascii) format specification.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Put the following in a file and run tbl and nroff (or iroff) on it.

----------------- cut here ----------------------
table 1
.TS
tab(;);
l l.
data;data
\_;\_
data;data
.TE
.sp
table 2
.sp
.TS
tab(;);
a a.
data;data
\_;\_
data;data
.TE
.sp
table 3
.sp
.TS
tab(;);

a a.
data;data
data;\_
data;data
.TE
----------------- cut here ----------------------

The first table will produce two short lines for the two columns, as it
is supposed to.  The second will not.  The third demostrates that tbl is
actually drawing the lines the full width of the column.

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
The bug occurs both for nroff and iroff.

Didn't look for the bug for all cases (as an example, 'n' [numeric data] format
spec).

Thanks to greta for finding this one.
