Subject: tip Racal Vadic driver inflexible about dialer speeds
Index: 	usr.bin/tip/aculib/v831.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The tip Racal Vadic driver assumes that the dialer communicates with
	the host at 2400 baud.  At least for our site, this is an incorrect
	assumption (it should also be pointed out that the UUCP Racal Vadic
	driver assumes that 1200 baud is the default) ...
Repeat-By:
	Try to use tip with a Racal Vadic whose dialer communicates with the
	host at a baud rate other than 2400.
Fix:
	Following is a cheapo fix.  A better fix would be (1) to define a
	``Dialer Baud Rate'' capability, or (2) to extend the semantics of
	the "br" capability along the same lines as done for the UUCP
	Racal Vadic driver (that would also remove the need for the
	vaconfig structure in the tip driver).  I didn't do (1) because it
	seemed far to general a solution for a problem raised by a single
	dialer.  I didn't do (2) because it would have involved an unknown
	amount of change to the rest of tip.

	Ideally of course, tip, UUCP, and anything else that needs
	dialout capability should all use a central service ...  But that's
	beyond the scope of this fix ...
