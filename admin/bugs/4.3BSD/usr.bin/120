Subject: arguments of the same name but of different dimensions
Index:	usr.bin/f77 4.3BSD

Subject:
	Incorrect results are obtained when a subroutine and a statement
	function have dummy arguments of the same name but of different
	dimensions.

Description:
	When a subroutine contains a statement function that involves an
	intrinsic function, and the dummy argument of the statement function
	is the same as one of the subroutine arguments, but of different
	dimension, only the first value of the array is used repeatedly.

	This bug is similar to Jerry Berkman's bug of 28 Feb 84, but is
	far more serious in that there is no warning to indicate that the
	results are in error.

Repeat-By:

	Try to compile and run the following:
	
      real vec(3)
      data vec / 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 /

      call sub(vec)

      end

      subroutine sub(x)
      real x(3)

      xmax(x) = max(x,1.0)

      sum = 0
      do 10 i=1,3
         sum = sum + xmax(x(i))
 10   continue

      print *, sum
      end

	The program will print "6.00000" instead of "9.00000".
