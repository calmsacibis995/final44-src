Subject: Incorrect handling of hangup signals in TIP (ACC PSR int008)
Index: 	usr.bin/tip/tip.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	When a remote connection is terminated by a hangup from the line,
	the user's terminal is left in RAW mode.
Repeat-By:
	We have seen this a lot with our X.25 PAD board. When remote
	host hangs up on logout, tip is exited with the user terminal
	left RAW.
Fix:
	in /usr/src/usr.bin/tip/tip.c
	add declaration "extern finish();"
	change	signal(SIGHUP,intTERM)	/* for dial-ups */
	to    	signal(SIGHUP,finish)	/* for dial-ups */
	then rebuild "tip" and install it.
