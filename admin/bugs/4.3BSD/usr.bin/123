Subject: "Assertion failed" message from refer
Index: usr.bin/refer 4.3BSD

Description:
	I get the following error message when I try to use refer with my 230K
	bibliography (violet.berkeley.edu:~potency/biblio/biblio):
		Assertion failed: file "hunt2.c", line 77
	Using /usr/old/refer does not produce this error message and works OK
	for the most part.
Repeat-By:
	Enter the following into a file called citation:
		.[
		bernstein gold 1985
		.]
	Run the following command from violet.berkeley.edu
	(~potency/biblio/biblio should be readable by all):
		refer -e -P -p ~potency/biblio/biblio citation
