Subject: find sources have some missing #ifdefs
Index: usr.bin/find/find.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The find sources have some ifdefs for pre-4.3 systems
	without _pw_stayopen.  However, one case was missed.
	
Repeat-By:
	Try to compile this on a machine without _pw_stayopen
	and -DNO_PW_STAYOPEN.
Fix:
