Subject: lint goofs structure type compatibility
Index: usr.bin/lint/Makefile 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	Some time ago, someone noted in comp.lang.c that 4BSD lint
	apparently believes that any two structures are compatible as
	long as their sizes are the same.  Lint was coded to believe
	that structures are compatible when their names *and* sizes are
	the same, but due to a small goof, gets this wrong.  (I fixed
	this some time ago for an unrelated problem that does not occur
	in 4.3BSD as distributed, but only recently noticed that it
	fixes this bug too, hence the late posting.)

Repeat-by:
	Run lint on the following file:

		struct foo { char *p; };
		struct bar { int *p; };

		f(x) struct foo *x; { x=x; }
		main() { f((struct bar *)0); }

	It should complain, but does not.

Fix:
	hash.c has code that is conditioned on #ifdef FLEXNAMES, but 
	does not include config.h and thinks FLEXNAMES is not defined.
