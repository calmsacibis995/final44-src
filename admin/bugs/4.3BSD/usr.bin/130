Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) tbl is too expansive (with fix)
#Index: usr.bin/tbl/t6.c MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87)
Index: usr.bin/tbl/t6.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The tbl command makes "expanded" boxes as wide as the current line
	width and indents them the current indentation.  If the current
	indentation is non-zero, this makes for boxes that extend too far to
	the right.

Repeat-By:
	Run this input through a "tbl | nroff | col | more" pipeline:
	.pl 3.5i
	.in +.5i
	Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their party.
	Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their party.
	.TS
	box expand ;
	l l .
	Oh	my
	.TE

Fix:
	The tbl command should either set the indent to zero or set the box
	width to the line length less the current indent.  Since the latter
	behavior is easier to achieve (and since it's what I want), it's what
	the fix below provides.  Somebody gets to decide whether this is
	"right".
