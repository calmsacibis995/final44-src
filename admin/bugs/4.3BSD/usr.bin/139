Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) clock time changes make uucico abusable (w/fix)
#Index: /usr/lib/uucp/uucico MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87)
Index: usr.bin/uucp/uucico 4.3BSD

Description:
	Now that users are allowed to set the environment variable "TZ" to
	change the system's idea of what local time is, "uucico" needs to
	explicitly ignore the "TZ" variable to avoid having impatient users
	force calls to remote systems at inappropriate times.

Repeat-By:
	Script started on Tue Nov 10 18:42:07 1987
	$ /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -x2 -simsvax
	ado imsvax (11/10-18:42-5119) DEBUG (Local Enabled)
	Wrong time ('Night') to call
	$ TZ=GMT /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -x2 -simsvax
	ado imsvax (11/10-23:42-5121) DEBUG (Local Enabled)
	ado imsvax (11/10-23:42-5121) SUCCEEDED (call to imsvax )

	ado imsvax (11/10-23:43-5121) OK (conversation complete)
	$ exit

Fix:
	Heed the admonition from the ctime(3) manual page:

> Programs that always wish to use local wall clock time should explicitly
> remove the environmental variable TZ with unsetenv(3).

	By the way. . .for system administrator types, it *would* be nice
	to have a uucico option that says, effectively, "I don't care what
	time it is--make the call anyway."  This is useful when, for example,
	a remote system has gone down for a long time and you want to make
	usually-prohibited daytime calls to clear the backlog.

	(And. . .I don't know whether there are other places where
	'unsetenv("TZ")' is also needed; I'll be on the lookout.)
