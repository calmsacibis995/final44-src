Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) uucico muffs "wanted" strings with \s's (w/fix)
Index: usr.bin/uucp/conn.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	L.sys file "\s" escapes in "wanted" strings are mishandled.

Repeat-By:
	Creating a legitimate L.sys file entry with a \s escape in a "wanted"
	string, then trying to call the system associated with the entry.
	Note that the call is never completed.

Fix:
	The "expect" function in "conn.c" tries to collapse escape sequences
	before looking for the wanted string.  Unfortunately, it collapses
	wanted strings such as
		aaa\sbbb
	to
		aaa\ bbb
	rather than
		aaa bbb

	Here's the fix (modeled on the "default" escape handling logic that
	follows the change shown below):
