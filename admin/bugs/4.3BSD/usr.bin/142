Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) contains /usr/5bin/tbl (with fix)
#Index: /usr/5bin/tbl MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87)
Index: usr.bin/tbl 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MORE/bsd 4.3 maintenance release includes /usr/5bin/tbl,
	which as I recall is part of the DWB package.  At least here
	at NIH, I don't believe we're licensed for DWB.

Repeat-By:
	ls /usr/5bin/tbl

Fix:
	rm /usr/5bin/tbl

	Alternately (preferably!) make the DWB package a no-cost addition
	to MORE/bsd.
