Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 nroff(1) manual page clashes with nroff (with fix)
#Index: usr.bin/nroff/n10.c MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: usr.bin/nroff/n10.c 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	The nroff manual page says that "37" is the default terminal type;
	the nroff code makes "lpr" the default terminal type.

Repeat-By:
	Examining the output of the commands
		grep 37 /usr/man/man1/nroff.1
		grep /tab /usr/src/usr.bin/nroff/n10.c
		grep /tab /usr/src/usr.bin/troff/ni.c

Fix:
	This case of documentation/performance clash is best resolved in favor
	of the documentation, since there are existing shell scripts with
	command sequences that use nroff's output as input to col--these
	script break if what nroff outputs in the absence of a "-t" option
	is no longer what col expects as input.  So:  change the "tablpr"
	in nroff/n10.c and the "tablpr" in "troff/ni.c" to "tab37"s.
