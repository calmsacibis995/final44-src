Subject: The C "lint" library lies about the arguments to "getsockname"
Index: 	usr.bin/lint/llib-lc 4.3BSD

Description:
	According to the documentation, the second argument to "getsockname"
	is a "struct sockaddr *".  However, according to the "lint" library,
	it's a "char *".  The documentation and the "lint" library agree
	about "getpeername"; they both say the second argument is a
	"struct sockaddr *".
Repeat-By:
	Write some code based on what the documentation says, and then
	try to "lint" it.
Fix:
	Change the line for "getsockname" in the "lint" library.
