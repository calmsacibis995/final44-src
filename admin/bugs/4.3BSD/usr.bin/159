DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
If you follow the example for sqrt
	1 over sqrt {ax sup 2 + bx + c}

the result is right, but the denominator and the numerator
are not lined up right.

If you follow the example for matrix, the output of it
seems like the ".nf" mode is on, in other words, the
outcome is not correct.

Embolding digits does not bold the digits.

COMMENTS:
This may be problem of itroff also.
