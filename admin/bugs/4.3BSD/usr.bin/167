MODULE NAME:
nroff

BUG PORTED TO UTX?
yep

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
When including null lines inside a .ce "n", those lines are not counted. 
(Although they do appear on the output.)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
.ce 3
1

3
.sp
This line don't fill right.
But this line will
fill OK.

---
Note: If you replace the null line with a line containing a blank, it works OK.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
See above.

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
Although I didn't check it, it probably applies to all line counts.
