SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
tbl column limit wrong.

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
tbl (i.e. t4.c)

BUG PORTED TO UTX?
Yes -- 1.3 and 2.0.

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The tbl documentation states that tbl has a maximum column limit of 20.
The limit is actually 19.

The bug appears to be in /usr/src/usr.bin/tbl/t4.c.  Within that file there
are the lines:

	if (icol>=MAXCOL)
		error("too many columns in table");

The first line should probably read:

	if (icol>MAXCOL)

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
<filename>: line <lineno>: too many columns in table
tbl quits

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Run the following table through tbl:
------------cut-------------------------------------
.TS
tab(;);
c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c.
j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j;j
.TE
------------cut-------------------------------------

SUGGESTED FIX:
The code should be changed as indicated previously.  Note that the code
must also be checked to make sure that using the last column does not
cause other things to break.  If it does in a way that is difficult to fix,
then the documentation should be changed to indicate that the max # of
columns supported by tbl is 19.  Note that this is NOT on the manpage, although
it should be; that is, the documentation that needs to be changed is the tbl
reference guide, and the limit should also be noted on the manpage.

OTHER COMMENTS:
Note that the bug is not on 1.2 or 32s 1.0 because those systems have a
SysV tbl.

CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY:
	/usr/src/usr.bin/tbl

PATH:
	/mnt/thomas/Bin:/usr/local:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/new

do we get to go back to sysV tbl with 2.0?  or at least
have it available as an option?
