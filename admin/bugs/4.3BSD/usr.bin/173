Subject: the -size arguemnt of find(1) thinks that blocks are 512 bytes long
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	as per subject.  It may say that it deals in 512 in the man
	page (I haven't looked) but to be consistant with the rest
	of 4.3, it should deal in K.
Repeat-By:
	find . -size 4 -ls
