Subject: Deficiency in dictionary
Index: 	usr.bin/spell/words 4.3BSD

Description:
	The dictionary does not include the word 'summer' (thoughe 'summertime'
	is in there!). We have a Bsd-based Sequent system here, which has
	about 1000 different words (both additions and deletions). It doesn't
	have 'summer' either.
Repeat-By:
	look summer
Fix:
	Add it, of course. Better still, have some method of getting words
	out of Webster or OED in a non-copyrightable way.

Subject: More errors in the spell database
Index: usr.bin/spell/words 4.3BSD

Description:
	'always', 'crossword', 'never' and 'nowadays' are misspelled.
Repeat-By:
	look
Fix:
	I have merged the spell databases of 4.3BSD, Sequent's Dynix, and
	AT&T's sysV.3.1. I have found these errors, as well as quite a few
	other non-words. If you are interested, I have a diff list (about
	30k). Please indicate preferred method of mailing (i.e. compressed,
	btoa-ed or uuencoded).
