Subject: Can't do shell escape from tip when running setuid'd
Index: 	usr.bin/tip/cmds.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	If tip is run setuid'd or setgid'd, any attempts to do a shell
    escape produce a `permission denied' message.  This is caused by a
    new (to 4.3) security feature in the C shell.  The shell now gets
    angry if the real and effective user (or group) id's are not the
    same, unless the -b flag is given.

Repeat-By:
	Do a `chmod u+s /usr/bin/tip', run tip (from an account other
    than the owner of tip, and try to fork off a subshell with the ~!
    command.  It won't work.

Fix:
	The fix is rather trivial (so trivial that it's probably been
    fixed before); you just make sure the real and effective user
    (group) id's are the same.  Here's a context diff of the old and
    new source files.

  	} else {
  		signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_DFL);
  		signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
+ 		/*
+ 		 * Set effective user (group) ID to real ID to stop
+ 		 * problems with new protection stuff in the shell.
+ 		 */
+ 		setreuid(uid, uid);
+ 		setregid(gid, gid);
  		if ((cp = rindex(value(SHELL), '/')) == NULL)
  			cp = value(SHELL);
  		else

    There is an identical problem with the user-contributed kermit
program; the fix is almost the same:
