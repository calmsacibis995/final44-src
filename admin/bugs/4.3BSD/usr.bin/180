Subject: mil is incorrect in units
Index: usr.bin/units.lib 4.3BSD

Description:
	A mil is incorrectly defined as one one-hundredth of an inch.
	It is one one-thousandth of an inch.
Repeat-By:
	units
	464 units; 3569 bytes

	you have: mil
	you want: inch
	* 1.000000e-02
	/ 1.000000e+02
Fix:
	Change line 424 (or thereabouts) of units.lib from
	    mil                     1-2 in
	to
	    mil                     1-3 in

	Interestingly enough, circularmil is correct.
