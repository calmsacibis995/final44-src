Subject: "fast find" code assumes automatics are initialized to zero
Index: 	usr.bin/find/find.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "fast find" code makes the invalid assumption that automatics in
	"main" are initialized to zero.  On systems such as SunOS 4.0 where
	this is *not* true (remember, this is not guaranteed *anywhere*), the
	"fast find" code won't work.

Fix:
	Thanks to Craig Leres of LBL:
