Subject: Fortran produces no message when changing loop variable
Index: 	usr.bin/f77 4.3BSD

Description:
	The ANSI standard for FORTRAN seems to state that the
	statements inside a DO loop may not change the value of the
	loop variable.  Unfortunately, the old (4.2BSD) compiler let
	the loop variable be changed within the loop.  The 4.3BSD
	compiler won't allow the loop variable to be changed, but
	prints no warning or error messages telling the user that
	something is wrong.  It simply ignores the statement that
	affects the loop variable.

	If changing the loop variable is indeed illegal, the compiler
	should produce a warning message; otherwise, statements that
	change the loop variable should not be ignored.

	Hopefully this is not a manifestation of a more subtle problem.

Repeat-By:
	Compile and run the following program:

	PROGRAM Loopbug
	INTEGER I

	DO 100 I=1, 50
	    PRINT*, 'I=', I
	    IF (I .GT. 5) THEN
		PRINT*, 'I > 5, subtracting 1 from I'
		I = I - 1
		PRINT*, 'I=',i
		STOP
	      ENDIF
100	  CONTINUE

	END

  It would be expected to produce the following output (or an error message):
      I=  1
      I=  2
      I=  3
      I=  4
      I=  5
      I=  6
      I > 5, subtracting 1 from I
      I=  5
    However, it produces this instead:
      I=  1
      I=  2
      I=  3
      I=  4
      I=  5
      I=  6
      I > 5, subtracting 1 from I
      I=  6
