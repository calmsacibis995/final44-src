Subject: atq core dump problem fixed
Index: usr.bin/at 4.3BSD

This turned out to be a bug in atq that was exposed by GCC
optimization.  The routine printdate() formats values into a string;
the string is 18 bytes long and allocated on the stack.  Unfortunately
the author didn't leave space for the trailing null, so the string is
really 19 bytes long.  When not optimizing, the date buffer is the last
local variable, but when optimizing it comes first.  Thus when
optimizing, the sprintf() stomps on the high byte of the stored frame
pointer, and the calling routine dumps core the next time it refers to
a local variable.

Here's the diff:
