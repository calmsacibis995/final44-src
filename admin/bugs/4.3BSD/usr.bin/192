Description:
	If /tmp and /etc are on the same file system, it is trivial
	to link (say) /etc/passwd to a file that calendar will write into.

Repeat-By:
	Wait until calendar starts running, find one of its temporary
	files (such as /tmp/cal2$$), and link /etc/passwd to it.

	If /tmp is sticky, you have to find the pid of the calendar
	process and link /etc/passwd before calendar creates the
	temporary file.  One easy way is to wait for /tmp/cal0$$ to
	appear, and then link /tmp/cal2$$ before calendar writes it.

Fix:
	Don't run calendar in the crontab (as root).
