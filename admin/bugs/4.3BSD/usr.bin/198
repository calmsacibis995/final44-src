Subject: (VS2) Version 6.0C: sort -u can lose lines

System type, version:	(VS2) Version 6.0C
System name:		oliver, paris
What's wrong:

sort -u largefile > output1
sort largefile | uniq > output2

output1 is missing one 3 character line  that is in output2.

largefile is 300K+, ~36K lines.

I will supply more details when I can narrow it down to something
smaller than the entire kernel source tree.

What should have happened:

sort -u and sort | uniq should be IDENTICAL.
