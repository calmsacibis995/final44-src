Subject: no terminal learn for eqn
Index: usr.bin/learn 4.3BSD

Description:
	The Computer Center no longer has any public hardcopy terminals.
	We do have tek4014/15 terminal emulators and dumb terminals.
	It would be nice to be able to use to do the eqn module of
	learn.  I understand that the nroff terminal driving tables can
	do half-line motions.
	
	When you do "learn eqn" you get:

	To do the lessons on eqn you need to login at a
	hardcopy terminal capable of half-line motions.
	Then I need to know what kind of terminal you are using.
	I will put you out of learn. Type the command
	
	setenv term xxx                 (that's term, not TERM)
	
	where xxx is one of the following:
	
	   300       382       450-12-8   a1        ipsi      xerox
	   300-12    382-12    832        aj832     ipsi-12   xerox12
	   300s      382cw     832-12     dtc       ipsi12
	   300s-12   450       833        dtc-12    odtc-12
	   tn300     450-12    833-12     ep40      x1700
	
	Then type "learn eqn" again.
	Leaving learn.
	Bye.

Fix:
	Create terminal driving tables??
