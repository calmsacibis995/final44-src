Subject: bug report
Index: usr.bin/{tip,uucp} 4.3BSD

Description:	The new version of uucp supports a spool
		directory mode of 755 (i.e. /usr/spool/uucp
		is writable only by uucp).  This is good.
		Tip runs suid uucp so that it can set
		a lock file in the uucp spool directory and
		thereby co-exist with uucp.  Unfortunately,
		after setting the lockfile tip does a
		setuid(getuid()) and thereby loses the
		necessary permission required to remove
		the lockfile after use.  Result is "orphaned"
		lockfiles.

Repeat-by:	chmod 755 /usr/spool/uucp; tip someone

Fix:		Good fix is not easy.  Simple fix is to
		run /usr/spool/uucp mode 777.
