Subject: fastfind does not work well in an NFS environment.
Index: usr.bin/find/* 4.3BSD

Description:
        If you want fastfind to work across NFS, updatedb trashes the file
	servers.  Since the database is not architecture independent, you
	cannot reuse the file in a heterogenous environment.  Also, if you
	want to run updatedb daily, you surely lose.

Repeat-By:
        Remove the text ``-fstype nfs -prune -o'' from the find in
	/usr/lib/find/updatedb, run it on several machines, and watch your
	file servers go to work.

Fix:
        I have a version of find/updatedb/code, which solves these problems,
	and adds new functionality.  In short, it:

	* maintains separate databases for each file system and keeps them in
	a shared area (a la suns /usr/share).  Each file server updates only
	its own databases, avoiding unnecessary NFS traffic.

	* makes architecture independent databases, for use in a heterogenous
	environments.  Also, it doesn't conflict with the use of 8-bit
	character sets.  The is done at the cost of a poorer compression of
	the database (though it isn't much).

	* supplies a program to automatically update a servers databases in
	parallel, avoiding trashing the disks.  Updates for each disk runs in
	sequence, but in parallel with the updates for the other disks.

	* adds a new interface, called ``fastfind,'' which accepts a few
	options.  ``fastfind -a pattern'' scans all databases for all hosts,
	``-s'' show names as the are on the file server, and ``-h host'' scans
	only the databases for ``host.''

	I haven't included the code here, but I will send it on request.  Drop
	me a note if you want to look at it.  We use it on Vaxen running
	MORE/bsd and Sun {3,4} running SunOS 4.0.  It uses the getmntent(3)
	interface to read /etc/mtab, so it doesn't work on Ultrix (and
	probably other systems too).  It is based on the version distributed
	with MORE/bsd.

Hope this is useful.
