Following is a calendar file I had in my home directory.  There were two
lines containing the date 5/31.  Yet calendar sent me mail about the
first one only.  This happened yesterday and again today.

I think this is a bug.  (Try "man calendar" and compare what calendar
should do with the above result.)

Cheers.
