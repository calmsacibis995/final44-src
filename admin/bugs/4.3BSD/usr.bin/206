Subject: Function scan_name() in fsplit(1) needs return(1) on success.
Index: usr.bin/f77/src/fsplit/fsplit.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	An omitted return in scan_name() can cause problems on non-Vaxen
	when sources contain leading commentary etc.  I fixed the problem
	in a private version several months ago. The problem fix is given
	below.

	I also have additional options available, if you'd like, which allow
	the user to select an over-write of existing files (and avoid the
	zzznnnn.f file names) and/or select inclusion of block data routines
	with executable source routines.  I'll be happy to send along the
	diffs in another mailing if you like.

Repeat-By:
	No failure case handy.  See the diffs.

Fix:
