Subject: ranlib overzealous in putting common symbols in __.SYMDEF
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	ranlib places N_UNDF|N_EXT symbols into the table of contents
	when it doesn't need to. Because the symbol is in the table of
	contents, the library element is linked into the executable even
	if the only connection between the main object files and the
	library element is they both have a common-class symbol of non-zero
	value.

	The only reason for placing such symbols in the table would be to
	handle the case where the library defines a larger version of the
	same symbol (something which should probably be an error, anyway,
	but that's a different issue). However, if the program being
	linked requires functions in the element with the common-class
	symbol, the common-class symbol will be handled properly without
	being in the table of contents. More importantly, if the program
	being linked *doesn't* require functions in the library element,
	if the common-class symbol *isn't* in the table of contents, the
	element won't be linked. This is especially important for oft-used
	symbols like __iob or __ctype_.

Repeat-By:
	Take a simple program that includes stdio.h and link it to a library
	that it doesn't need, but that also includes stdio.h. You will end
	up with files from the library that you don't need. In my case,
	I also ended up with two undefined symbols that I didn't need...
Fix:
	Remove the test for n_value being non-zero in ranlib.c when in the
	N_UNDF arm of the main switch statement.
