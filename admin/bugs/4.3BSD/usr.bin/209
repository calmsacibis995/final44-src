Subject: null pointer bugs in learn
Index: usr.bin/learn/copy.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	On a machine that doesn't allow dereferencing null pointers
	(say, a Sun 4), learn will die fairly early into the sequence of
	lessons in "learn vi."
Repeat-By:
	Install learn on a Sun 4.

	In deference to the UCB folks, I don't know if the Tahoe version
	still has this problem or not.
Fix:
	Apply the following context diff to the file copy.c in the learn
	source directory.

Thanks.  This has been fixed in the Tahoe version.
