Subject: vi can't "change" to mark register 'd'
Index: usr.bin/ex./ex_voper.c 4.3BSD +FIX
Date: Thu, 21 Dec 89 20:57:51 PST
From: Craig Leres <leres@helios.ee.lbl.gov>


Description:
	A visual "change" command that involves mark register 'd'
	doesn't work.

Repeat-By:
	Edit a file with vi. Mark a location ("md") and move a few
	lines up or down and try to change the region back to mark d
	("c'd").

	On a Vax (or Vax clone) the specified region will be
	(incorrectly) deleted. On a Sun, vi will core dump.

Fix:
	I think the problem is that vchange() and vdelete() expect to
	be called with the command character (either 'c' or 'd'). (This
	theory is backed by the fact that vdelete() invokes vchange()
	with an argument of 'd'.) However, operate() passes the last
	character read, which happens to be the mark register letter
	when changing a region with a mark register. In this case, a
	nil pointer is dereferenced.

	The fix is to pass the first command character.
