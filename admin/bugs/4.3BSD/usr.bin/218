Subject: UUCP should allow the hostname to be overridden
Index: usr.bin/uucp/uucpname.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	It's nice to be able to use a UUCP name that is different from
	your hostname.

Repeat-By:
	Have a host with some standard (strange) hostname, but whose UUCP
	name you'd really rather have as something memorable.  We have a
	host skippy.umiacs.umd.edu with a UUCP connection, and we'd really
	rather have it be UUCP host 'umiacs'...

Fix:
	Move the code in uucpname.c around so UUCP will always look first in
	/etc/uucpname for the hostname.  Maybe there's some screwing around
	with UUCP aliases and the like that can be done to avoid this code
	change.  I don't know; I'm not a UUCP wizard, and a wiz should think
	about this before putting it in.

	-Steve
