Subject: refer alphebatizes incorrectly
Index: 	usr.bin/refer/refer7.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Refer alphebatizes names which start with lower case letters
	incorrectly.  It can be verified that it is incorrect by
	comparing its procedure to sortbib, which does it right.
	Basically, refer would sort "Arnold, deFranco, Jones" as
	"Arnold, Jones, deFranco" instead.
Repeat-By:
	Create a bibliography file for refer with three entries as
	given above.  Now, write a paper refering to those three
	papers.  If you run sortbib on the bibliography file, you will
	get them in the proper order.  If you run refer on the paper
	using that bibliography file and the "-s" (sort) option, you
	will get the improper behaviour.
Fix:
	The following is a context diff.  The problem is that case
	should be ignored when sorting.  The solution is to add the
	"-f" (fold case, i.e., ignore case) option to the "sort"
	command which refer invokes to sort the references.
