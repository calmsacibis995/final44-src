Subject: lint
Index: usr.bin/lint 4.3BSD

	It seems that all Berkeley derived lints no longer report functions
referenced but not declared.  Thus linting the file

		main()
		{
			foobar();
		}

will not produce any warnings about foobar not being defined.


	Is there a solution or a patch somewhere?
