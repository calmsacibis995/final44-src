Subject: rdist incorrectly links if the remote tree has a different root
Index: usr.bin/rdist 4.3BSD

Description:
	If the the local directory tree (say, /usr/tmp/tst) has files below
	it that are hard links to one another, and the remote tree (say
	/va/bostic) is rooted somewhere else, then rdist tries to make the
	hard links with the local tree's leading path elements rather than
	the remote tree's leading path.

Repeat-By:
	So if /usr/tmp/tst on the local host has two files, t1 and t2, with
	t2 being a hard link to t1, rdist will correctly produce /va/bostic/t1
	on the remote host but will attempt to link /usr/tmp/t2 to it.
	This usually fails and is wrong in any case.
