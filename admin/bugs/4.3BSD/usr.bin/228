Subject: Bug in bc -l
Index: usr.bin/bc/lib.b 4.3BSD

Description:
	This is a *very* old bug.  When running bc -l,
	the function a()  (arctan)  always returns the same result,
	regardless of the argument.
Repeat-By:
	bc -l
	a(anything but 1)
	always returns pi/4.
Fix:
	Someone tried to be smart, and added a statement that returns pi/4
	if the argument is 1.  However, s/he forgot that in bc newlines
	act like ';' and terminate statements, the result being that two
	if's are ignored.  The fix is just to put the statement on one line
	instead of three:

< 	if(x==1)
< 		if(scale<52)
< return(.7853981633974483096156608458198757210492923498437764/1)
