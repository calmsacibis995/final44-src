Subject: Dc makes mistakes in truncating negative numbers
Index: 	usr.bin/dc 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU

Description:
	
	When truncating negative numbers, dc sometimes rounds down, instead
	of up towards zero.
Repeat-By:
	Inside dc, do
	0k _1.19 1/p _1.190 1/p
	Note that the result in the first case is -2 instead of -1.
