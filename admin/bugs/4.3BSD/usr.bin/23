Subject: tip fails to cycle past a "dead" device.
Index:	usr.bin/tip/hunt.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The following bug report and fix are brought to you by Richard Wolff.

	tip fails to cycle through multiple modem devices (dv entry in
/etc/remote) if a particular device is found to be "dead".  Cycling works
properly only when a device is "busy".

Repeat-By:
	Have multiple entries for dv in /etc/remote.  Arrange for the first
device in the list to be "dead" (powering-off the modem works for me).  Try
to tip and notice the "all ports busy" message.

Fix:
