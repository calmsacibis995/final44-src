Subject: ranlib should not require writable cwd
Date: Fri, 17 Aug 90 12:07:36 EDT
From: Stephen Gildea <gildea@alexander.bbn.com>

Description:
	Ranlib always creates its temporary file __.SYMDEF in the
	current directory.  It does not matter where the archive is.
	Thus if the current directory is not writable, ranlib fails.

	This behavior is particularly annoying when installing
	libraries built on an NFS-mounted disk.  You have to install as
	root, which means you have no permissions on the NFS disk
	(which contains your working directory), so ranlib fails.

	There is no reason ranlib success should depend on the
	permissions of an arbitrary directory.

Repeat-By:
	Try to run ranlib from a directory with mode 555.  You will get
	the message "can't create temporary".

Fix:
	If the cwd fails, ranlib should try /tmp for its temporary file.
