Subject: troff/nroff prematurely interrupts end-macro processing
Index:	usr.bin/troff/n7.c 4.3BSD

Description: 
	(The following bug-report and fix are from D'Anne Thompson)

	End-macro processing in troff/nroff/ditroff is being prematurely
interrupted.  Only a single page of text was being ejected upon reaching the
end of input text.  This was the case even when there was diverted material,
notably a floating keep, that should be floated to the top of another new
page.  After investigation it was found that only the current page at the
time of reaching the end-macro was being completed, any additional pages that
might be due to the end-macro processing itself were being suppressed.

Repeat-By:  
	Run the following through troff/nroff using -me

.fo ''Footer''
.pp
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
A normal paragraph.
.sp 7.0i
.(z
A Floating keep.
It should float to the top of the 
following page.

This should be the second page output, if end-macro
processing is working correctly.

She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
.)z
.pp
A normal paragraph.


Fix:
	file n7.c, subroutine newline()
