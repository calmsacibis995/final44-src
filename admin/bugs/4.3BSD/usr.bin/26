Subject: [nt]roff loops
Index: usr.bin/[tn]roff 4.3BSD

Description:
	Both nroff and troff occasionally get into some kind of weird
	loop in which they keep eating up cpu time forever but never
	produce any output.

Repeat-By:
	Run the following:

sed -e '/^\.if[ 	]t/d' -e 's/^\.if[ 	]n[ 	]\././' \
	/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an | soelim | nroff - /usr/lib/man/man1/true.1

	This causes the loop consistently on a number of machines I have tried.
	This has been tested on a VAX running 4.2BSD, a VAX running Ultrix,
	a VAX running 4.3BSD and an Integrated Solutions (68K cpu) running
	4.2BSD.

-----------------------------------------------------

nroff of this doesn't come back:

.de TH
.ds ]L \\$3
..
.TH "\\$1" "\\$2" "\\$3" "\\$4" "\\$5"
