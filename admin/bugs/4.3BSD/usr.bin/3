Subject: install doesn't work if destination is a directory
Index: 	usr.bin/install.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	Install does not properly handle the case where the destination
	is a directory and the path of the binary to be installed has one
	or more slashes (/) in it.
Repeat-By:
	% echo foo > foo
	% install `pwd`/foo /tmp
Fix:

< then	file=$2/$1
---
> then	file=$2/`basename $1`
