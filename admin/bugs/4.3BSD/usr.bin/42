Subject: Two localisms added to calendar/potentially useful
Index: usr.bin/calendar/calendar.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	Some folks prefer their calendar to live in ".calendar", like
	many of the other configuration files that are in the "set and
	forget" category.  This change allows ".calendar" files to work
	as "calendar" files.

	Further, some users have the annoying habit of typing something
	like "calendar 1987" in an attempt to print a calendar for the year;
	this inevitably chews up a lot of cpu going nowhere fast, since most
	users' home directories are not world-readable.  This change only
	allows "root" to run calendar with an argument or arguments.

Repeat-By:
	N/A.

Fix:
	Diffs are enclosed below.  Revision 4.3.1.1 is the 4.3BSD released
	version; revisino 4.3.1.2 includes the local changes.
