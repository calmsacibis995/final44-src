Subject: 4.3$BSD bug in troff
Index: usr.bin/troff 4.3BSD

Can't remember the format offhand.  I'm sure I'll get a letter back,
which I promise to squirrel away for future reference...

in /usr/src/usr.bin/troff/n3.c, there are lots of uses of "unsigned".
What they mean to say is "filep", which is typedefed diferently on
systems with VMUNIX (in which case it is "long") and ones without
(in which case it is "unsigned").  Somebody forgot to change n3.c
when they added the VMUNIX stuff.  The appropriate fix is

        cd /usr/src/usr.bin/troff
        ex n3.c
        :g/unsigned/s//filep/g
        :wq

Since "unsigned" is the same size as "long".  This hasn't *yet* caused
*you* guys any problems...
