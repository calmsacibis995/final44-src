Subject: lint doesn't understand cc's -L option
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Since lint needs the full path to a lint library not in /usr/lib/lint,
	whenever a non-standard library is added for linking purposes in a
	makefile, the lint action must be explicitly updated to reference the
	appropriate lint file.  If lint understood the -L option then the lint
	action could share a library macro with the cc action in the makefile.
	
	This does enforce the lib/*.a, lib/lint/llib-l*.ln separation of files,
	but it greatly simplifies makefile maintence.

Repeat-By:
	Try to maintain a makefile which allows linting against non-standard
	libaries.

Fix:
	Apply the following patch to the lint shell script:

	6c6
	< X= P=unix LL=/usr/lib/lint
	---
	> X= P=unix LL=/usr/lib/lint LP=
	13c13,18
	< 	-l*)	cat $LL/llib$A.ln >>$T ;;
	---
	> 	-L*)	LP="$LP `echo $A | sed -e s/-L//`/lint" ;;
	> 	-l*)	D=$LL
	> 		for B in $LP ; do
	> 			if [ -r $B/llib$A.ln ] ; then D=$B ; break ; fi
	> 		done
	> 		cat $D/llib$A.ln >>$T ;;
