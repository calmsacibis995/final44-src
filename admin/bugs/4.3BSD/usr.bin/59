Subject: fix for previous lint bug fix
Index: usr.bin 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The previous fix bombs when there's a -llib option but no
	-Ldir option.

Repeat-By:
	Installing the previous fix and linting a file only against
	the math library.

Fix:
	Here's the revised diff for lint to run through patch:

	7c7
	< C=
	---
	> C= LP=$LL
	13c13,17
	< 	-l*)	cat $LL/llib$A.ln >>$T ;;
	---
	> 	-L*)	LP="$LP `echo $A | sed -e s/-L//`/lint" ;;
	> 	-l*)	for B in $LP ; do
	> 			if [ -r $B/llib$A.ln ] ; then break ; fi
	> 		done
	> 		cat $B/llib$A.ln >>$T ;;
