Subject: m4 does not recognize macros after "#"
Index: 	usr.bin/m4 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Any macros that come after a sharp-sign (#) are not
	expanded.
Repeat-By:
	m4 << EOF
	define(`ignored', `recognized')dnl
	This macro is ignored
	But this # macro is ignored
	EOF

	The word "ignored" is changed to "recognized" in the
	first output line.

	The code makes it clear that this is intentional.  The
	manual does not mention it.  Which should be changed?
