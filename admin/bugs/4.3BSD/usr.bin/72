Subject: f77 write statements - syntax error for parentheses around expressions
Index: usr.bin/f77 4.3BSD

Description:
	The f77 compiler reports a syntax error when a write statement
	contains an expression that is comletely enclosed by parentheses.
Repeat-By:
	Procedure to repeat the problem.
	The following program when run produces the compiler diagnostic:
		Error on line 5: syntax error

	      integer i, k
	      i = 1
	      k = 2
	c error due to parentheses
	      write(6,100) (i+10)
	 100  format(i5)
	      stop

Just catching up on a little backlog in my copious spare time...

	The f77 compiler reports a syntax error when a write statement
	contains an expression that is comletely enclosed by
	parentheses.

This particular problem is well known and isn't likely to go away any
time soon.  F77 is trying to get along with YACC but the language it's
parsing was designed before context-free grammars came along, and there
are a few difficulties.  One difficulty is that it can be hard to tell
an ordinary parenthesized I/O parameter from (say) an implied DO
parameter.  I've tried fixing this before and discovered that the f77
grammar is a shaky house of cards waiting to come tumbling down -- a
little tug in one place and suddenly it stops working right in major
ways.  In theory this buglet could be fixed but in practice it probably
isn't worth the hassle, especially given the more important bugs that
still inhabit the compiler.
