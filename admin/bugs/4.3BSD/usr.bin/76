Subject: sendmail file locking.
Index: usr.bin/sendmail 4.3BSD

Hi eric, I am sure you are tired about hearing about sendmail, but here
it goes:

Problem:  Sendmail does not lock the file it is delivering to.  /bin/mail
	does do locking when delivering mail for a user.

Repeat by:  Put a sleep(30) in between (*CurEnv->e_puthdr)() and 
	(*CurEnv->e_putbody)() in the routine mailfile()(deliver.c).  Then fire 
	off two pieces of mail back to back which are destined for file 
	delivery.  You will lose part of the first piece of mail.

Fix:  use flock().  The following patches need to be applied to 
	deliver.c and savemail.c.  This needs to be fixed differently if
	you are using suns lockd and sharing mail spool directories.
	The patch to savemail.c might be overkill.
