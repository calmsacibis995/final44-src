Subject: group "bin" referenced in install
Index: 	usr.bin/install.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	The group "bin" has been removed with 4.3, but "bin"
	is referenced in "install"
Repeat-By:
	Type any install command without specifying any group.
Fix:
	edit install.sh and change the default chgrp command to
	chgrp to "wheel".
