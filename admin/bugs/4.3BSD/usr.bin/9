Subject: file identifies character special devices as block special
Index: 	usr.bin/file.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The file command claims that character special devices are block
	special.
Repeat-By:
	Run file on a character special device, and not that it says "block
	special."
Fix:
Put the parentheses in, like so:
