Subject: Having trouble with the UUCP "rvmacs" dialer
Index: 	usr.bin/uucp/aculib/rvmacs.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	As the subject indicates, this is going to be somewhat vague.
	We're having trouble with the rvmacs dialer.  The most
	significant symptom is having a call go through successfully
	(dialer returns code 'A'), but nothing ever comes though on the
	data line once it's opened.  This problem only occurs with
	some of our UUCP neighbors.
Repeat-By:
	Unknown.  We are having trouble talking to ihnp4, ucdavis and
	csuchic.
Fix:
	Unknown.  However, I do have a small fix to the rvmacs driver which
	actually seems to have helped some with the problem described
	above.  Even if it doesn't help, it's correct:
