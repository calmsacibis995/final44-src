Subject: Bug in sort.c
Index: usr.bin/sort.c 4.3BSD

I don't know whether you are interested in bug reports;
please tell me where I should file them if not with you.
A bug that exists since as long as I can remember can be
found on line 23 of my copy of sort.c.
There an array of length 30 is reserved for an arbitrary
pathname. Needless to say that sort -T$HOME/tmp yields
strange results as soon as $HOME expands to more than 13
characters.

Best regards, Andries

PS My source says "sort.c 4.11 (Berkeley) 6/3/86".
