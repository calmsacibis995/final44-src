MODULE NAME: tip(1)/cu(1) command--acu.c module

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM: acu.c has a procedure called connect() that
is used called tip.c and cu.c.  This is a porting bug, since any port
involving sockets will break if using the connect library call.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
Have tip or cu connect to a socket and nothing will happen.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
This will only break if someone adds to the code.

SUGGESTED FIX:
Change the name of the module and all references to it to something else

like "acu_connect".

OTHER COMMENTS:
This is not a "real" bug per se.
