wrong tbl width calculations

MODULE NAME:
tbl(1)

BUG PORTED TO UTX?

yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
Tbl sometimes does not calculate the widths of columns correctly.

In the table format section, if one specifies I or B (for italics
or  bold),  and  if one specifies a point size via p (absolute or
relative), tbl does not use those parameters when calculating the
widths  of  alphabetic  fields.   The  data is output using those
parameters, however.

Furthermore, for numeric fields, everything to the  LEFT  of  the
decimal  point  has the width correctly calculated; everything to
the RIGHT of the decimal point does not (I think this is the case
anyway).

Note that for the combination of point size change  and  centered
field,  the point size is taken into account when calculating the
width of the centered field.  I do not  know  about  other  cases
because I did not do an exhaustive set of tests.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
make a test table with a format section like:

        cIp8 nIp8 aIp8.

make up some data, run it through tbl, and dump the output of tbl
into a file.  Look at the tbl output.

SUGGESTED FIX:

OTHER COMMENTS:
One can get around this  problem  by  including  the  point  size
change  info  and  the font type info right in with the data (via
\fI, \fB, etc., and \s?); note that this is messy,  however,  and
ruins the use of the I and B specifiers.

Someone might say I'm using an old version  of  tbl.   Well,  I'm
using  /usr/bin/tbl  on alberto and there is no /usr/local/tbl or
/usr/new/tbl...
