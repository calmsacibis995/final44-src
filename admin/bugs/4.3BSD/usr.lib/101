SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
Minor bug in manpage macro set.

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	
Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an.new (TH macro)
DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
The .TH macro in the standard Berkeley manpages is supposed to be able
to take up to five arguments.  The fifth argument is used to replace the
heading "UNIX Programmer's Manual," which appears on the top of the page.
This part of the macro is miscoded.  Lines 104 and 105 are:

104   .ie "\\$5"" .ds ]D UNIX Programmer's Manual
105   .el .ds ]D \\$5

The double quotes on 104 should be single quotes, like this:

104   .ie '\\$5'' .ds ]D UNIX Programmer's Manual
105   .el .ds ]D \\$5

I found this one while helping Jim Leo write a manual page for NP1.
When we re-defined the .TH macro with this change, it worked as
documented.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:
See Jim Leo.
HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)
Use the .TH macro with five different arguments after it.

SUGGESTED FIX:
Noted above.
OTHER COMMENTS:
Obviously the world has lived with this bug for a long, long time.
On a 1-5 scale, this is definitely a 5.

This was found on Gould machines and is a UTX/32 bug also.
