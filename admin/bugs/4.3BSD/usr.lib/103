SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:  (Type on next line)
	Printing very large files.

Operating System:       4.2 BSD	

Patch Level:  		
Hardware Environment:   DEC VAX-11/780 
Organization:		Gould-CSD/Urbana      (217) 384-8500 
                        1101 E. University, Urbana, Il 61801

MODULE NAME:
	printer

BUG PORTED TO UTX? 
	yes.

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	If you print a very large file, say 1066564 bytes, lpr (or print)
	mumbles something about "copy file too large".  It then runs off
	and prints the first N bytes of the file.  It should probably 
	dequeue the job.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

short_title: Special Consideration: large file could be truncated needs explaining
prob_desc: In the Special Consideration section it is stated that "Large files
could be truncated"

Please add :
The lpr command restricts the largest printable file via the "mx"
parameter which can be defined in the /etc/printcap entry.
The default is 1000 blocks of 1K bytes.
To enable the printing of large files, either modify the printcap entry
or use the lpr -s option.
