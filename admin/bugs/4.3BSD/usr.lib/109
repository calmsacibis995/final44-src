Subject: sendmail can loop collecting long headers
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/util.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Sendmail can loop forever if it tries to collect a message with
	a very long (> MAXFIELD) header.  The sfgets function is called
	repeatedly to read the header lines, but when the header overflows
	the buffer into which it's being read, then the length parameter
	to sgets goes negative.  Sfgets doesn't check this parameter, but
	passes it blindly to fgets.  Fgets, when passed a negative length,
	returns NULL, and we go round and round in sfgets.
Repeat-By:
	Try to receive a message with a header field, eg To:, that totals
	more than MAXFIELD (2400) characters.  Watch sendmail loop.
Fix:
	Have sfgets check for a negative length and return immediately.
	NOTE: With this fix in, the header will get truncated, and the
	message may be mangled, but at least sendmail doesn't loop.  A
	better fix would correct the mechanism in collect() that reads
	the long header.
