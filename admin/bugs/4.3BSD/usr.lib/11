Subject: smtp server doesn't set s macro properly or recognize itself
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/srvrsmtp.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The smtp server fails to parse the hostname correctly in the HELO command.
	This causes the `s' macro to be set incorrectly.  It also causes the 
	server to fail to recognize itself.

Repeat-By:
	telnet localhost 25
	<return>
	HELO <fully-qualified-local-hostname>

	Sendmail will say 
	"250 <fully-qualified-local-hostname> Hello,  <fully-qualified-local-hostname>, pleased to meet you"
	Note the extra space before the sencond hostname.  This is a mistake.

Fix:
	The pointer to the beginning of the name is pointing at the space
	before the start of the hostname.  This doesn't bother other parts of
	the protocol because they call skipword() which starts by skipping
	spaces.  The fix is to increment p past the spaces to begin with.
	This fix has been tested.
