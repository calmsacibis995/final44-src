Subject: Non-standard #define confuses ANSI compiler
Index: usr.lib/libtermlib/tgoto.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	tgoto.c uses a non-standard construct:

		#define	CTRL(c)	('c' & 037)
		...
		if (... CTRL(d) ...)

	Believe it or not, this is illegal C (by a strict reading of K&R
	p207: "Text inside a string or a character constant is not subject
	to replacement."), although many hack programmers have been doing
	it for years and even some well-known programmers seem to like
	it.  CPP and Greenhill's C do what Joy intended, but GNU CC
	respects the character constant 'c'.

	I'm told ANSI C specifically prohibits such constructs, but I
	don't have a copy of the draft.

Repeat-By:

	% GNU-CC -E tgoto.c | more

	Notice that CTRL(d) gets replaced with ('c' & 037), rather than
	('d' & 037).

Notes:
	There are many details in BSD4.3 that depend on quirks of the
	compiler.  I wasn't going to mention this one until I recalled
	that Torek had been on an ANSI-C kick recently.

	I just noticed that Joy did the same thing in ex/vi.  Ick.

Fix:
