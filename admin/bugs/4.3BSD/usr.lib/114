Subject: inconsistant #include's for "sendmail.h"
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/{daemon,deliver,domain}.c 4.3BSD

Description:

	A minor nit; the aforementioned files have:

		#include <sendmail.h>

	rather than:

		#include "sendmail.h"

	Compilation under older makefile's break because of this, and
	switching is kind of a pain due to localizations.  I see no
	good reason for using <>'s, and for consistancy, with the other
	files, they should be changed to ""'s.

Repeat-By:

	Examiniation of ../usr.lib/sendmail/src/{daemon,deliver,domain}.c

Fix:

	/bin/csh -f
	cd /usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/src
	foreach File ({daemon,deliver,domain}.c)
		ex - $File <<HERE
		%s/<sendmail.h>/"sendmail.h"/
		wq
		HERE
	end
