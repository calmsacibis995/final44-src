Subject: newliases replaces alias definitions with subsequent ones.
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/alias.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	sendmail, aka newliases, quietly replaces alias definitions with
	subsequent ones.

Repeat-By:
	Add the following lines to your /usr/lib/alias file:

		postmaster: root
		Postmaster: postmaster

	and then try sending mail to postmaster.

Fix:
	Check for an existing entry in the database before storing a new
	one, and if it is there, report it.
