Subject: sendmail security hole worse than debug mode

Index:	usr.lib/sendmail 4.3BSD

Description:
	There is still a very serious security hole in sendmail, akin to the
	sendmail debug problem.  Basically I can do the same things as the
	recent sendmail worm but without a need for debug mode.  The problem is
	a bit more insidious and quite a bit more difficult to close.

	The problem is summarized as follows.  I can mail to a program by
	mailing *from* the program and mailing *to* a bogus user.  Sendmail will
	notice that the recipient doesn't exist and queue return mail to the
	sender indicating this fact.  However, if the "person" who sent the mail
	is a program, then sendmail will send the mail to that program!!!  This
	is clearly indicated with the following script.

================================================================================

By examining the script session you will notice that *even though* sendmail is
generating error messages (eg. "550 zargon6... User unknown"), the request is
still queued!

I leave it up to you to figure out an appropriate fix.  This one should be
interesting...
