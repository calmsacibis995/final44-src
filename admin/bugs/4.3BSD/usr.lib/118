Description:
	The "troff -me" command produces misaligned boxes if you make them
	bold and have them on the same page as a footnote.

Repeat-By:
	Feed this input to "troff -me"
		Note that\0
		.ft B
		.bx " this is only a test "
		.ft R
		\0of the -me macros.*
		.(f
		*Had it been an actual document, it would have meant something.
		.)f
	and note that the box around the text is misaligned.

Fix:
	The "-me" macros try to artificially embolden special font characters
	when you're in the bold font.  That's a good idea.  And the "-me"
	macros also try to vary the artificial emboldening when you vary
	point size.  That's also a good idea.  But as the good book says,
	"The mode must be still or again in effect when the characters are
	physically printed."  And the "-me" macros fail to arrange for that.

	Somebody with patience might want to dip in and arrange for
	correct variable artificial emboldening.  It will be a little hard,
	since artificial emboldening isn't part of troff environments.

	Your correspondent chose the easy way out; I just deleted the
		.bd S B \\n(.su/3u
	line from "/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.e".  This means that the remaining
		.bd S B 3
	line in "/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.e" is *always* in effect.  You might want
	to change it to
		.bd S B 2
	to be on the safe side.
