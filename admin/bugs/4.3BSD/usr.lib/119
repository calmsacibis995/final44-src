Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (10/5/87) termcap writeup and actions don't jive
Index: usr.lib/libtermlib/termcap.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The termcap(5) manual page says that ". . .empty fields may be
	included for readability. . ."  Utterly empty fields can't be
	included.

	The "that" entry has an absolutely empty ("::") field;
	when you try to use the entry, the "cl" capability is mishandled.

	A code fix might be best; a documentation change might be easiest.
