Subject: sccsid always shows alias.c without DBM library
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/alias.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Due to the placement of the header files in relation to the include
	files, DBM is never defined in alias.c so that the sccsid that
	goes into the header always shows "(without DBM)" regardless of
	whether dbm is included.

Repeat-By:
	"strings /usr/lib/sendmail" and observing the sccsid from alias.c

Fix:
	Just move the sccsid definition down to after the header files have 
	been read in.  I also moved the order of the header files around
	a little, but this was just for my convenience and has no bearing
	on the other fix.  This fix has been tested.
