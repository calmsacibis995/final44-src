Subject: `LineNumber' not incremented when reading :include: file
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/recipient.c 4.3BSD (sendmail 5.59)

Description:
	When reading from an include file, sendmail fails to increment
	the global variable LineNumber with each fgets().  This can
	result in error messages on line number 0.  For example:

		/u/reading/fa.gouldbugs/list: line 0: [...]

Repeat-By:
	Include a file containing an alias which will result in a
	prescan error.

Fix:
	The include() routine saves the current `FileName' and
	`LineNumber' variables; it then reinitializes them to the
	"file to be included" and "0" respectively.  Trouble is,
	`LineNumber' never gets incremented in the fgets() loop.
	The following patch fixes this.
