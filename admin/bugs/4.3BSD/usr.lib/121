Subject:  SERIOUS security problems with lpr(1)
Index: usr.lib/lpr/lpr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	There are SERIOUS security problems with the lpr(1) command.
	
	Basically, /usr/bin/lpr is a setuid root program, but it
	does not check whether the user really has read access to
	the file it has been asked to print. Therefore, you can
	use lpr(1) to print read-protected files.
	
	Furthermore, you can use lpr(1)'s "-r" option to REMOVE
	files from directories where you do not have write permission.

Repeat-By:
	Pick a read protected file in a directory where you have
	search access. Do "lpr filename" and watch in horror (or
	glee, depending on your point of view) as the file is
	printed.
	
	Pick a file in a directory where you have search access but
	not write access. Do "lpr -r filename" and watch as the
	file is unlinked.
	
Fix:
	Due to the "giving-away-the-store" nature of the bugs in lpr and
	the possibility	that there are many more bugs concealed in there,
	I prefer an official Berkeley fix in comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes.

	of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern
	University first noticed these bugs.
