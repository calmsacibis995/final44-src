Subject: Sendmail 5.61 bug/annoyance
Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src 4.3BSD

Description:
	Our newly received/compiled/installed version of Sendmail 5.61
	seems to be having problem delivering to Xerox.COM.  I'm not
	certain yet what's causing that, but that's not the main point of
	this bug report.  For the record, "ps ax" shows:
	10119 ?  I <   0:00 -AA08336 Xerox.COM: HELO wait (sendmail)

	At that point, the connection hangs, and eventually times out.
	The message is both left on the mailqueue for later re-trys
	AND an error return message is mailed back to the original
	sender.  This is annoying!!!  The next time sendmail runs the
	queue, it will again try to send the message, hang, timeout, and
	generate ANOTHER error return message...  No error return
	should be generated in this case, until the 3-day retry limit
	has been reached.

	The headers from one of the returned messages appear below:

	There may be an additional bug here- When this happens, according
	to the code a syslog message "timeout waiting for input from %s\n"
	is supposed to be produced, with "%s" filled in with the 
	"RealHostName", but this seems to always print out blank:

	Jan 27 08:08:31 cu-arpa sendmail[8874]: timeout waiting for input from

Repeat-By:
	Difficult.  Set up the above situation somehow, and wait.
Fix:
	A quick comparison of the 5.59 sendmail code with the 5.61 code
	leads me to belive that this can be fixed in the util.c source
	module, in the sfgets routine.  In the 5.59 version, a timeout
	would result in a call to "syserr", with errno set non-zero,
	which results in an error message with a 4xx code.  In the 5.61
	code, a call is instead made to usrerr, which produces an
	error message with a 5xx code, and results in the EF_FATALERRS
	flag being set, and this I suspect is what later causes an
	error message to be mailed.

	In the 5.61 version, errno is set to 0 before calling usrerr.
	"syserr" produces a 5xx code if errno is 0, otherwise a 4xx code.
	"usrerr" ignores errno.
