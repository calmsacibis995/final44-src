Subject: getc() calls in collect() will never time out
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/collect.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	1) About a week ago, I sent a fix to stop sendmail from looping on
	long header fields.  Chris Torek pointed out that since my fix used
	a getc()-for-newline loop, it would not time out.  He was correct,
	however there are two other loops in collect() that also use getc()
	loops -- they too, will never time out.

	2) The getc()-for-continuation-field loop in collect() can mistake
	an `addr, addr' sequence for a continuation field resulting in really
	strange headers and munging memory past `buf[]'.

	3) If sfgets() returns NULL (i.e. failure), further calls to sfgets()
	may be made -- they too, will return failure, of course.

	In summary, the header collection loop is fairly messed up.

Repeat-By:
	1) There is no timeout protection in collect(); getc() will never
	time out.

	2) Feed a header longer than MAXFIELD to sendmail, if the sfgets()
	fills up `buf' leaving a space as the next char on `InChannel', it
	assumes this is a continuation line and (assuming collect() sccsid
	5.7) appends "\n " to `buf' (which is already full).

	3) Examination of get-header loop.

Fix:
	I changed the getc()-for-newline loops to sfgets()-until-newline.
	However, the getc()-for-continuation-field/ungetc()-if-not can not
	be handled easily.  Since I still wanted to use sfgets(), I decided
	it would be best to use two buffers; one for the header field that's
	being put together and the other for reading ahead.

	At the end of the get-continuation-field loop, the first buffer
	contains a full header, while the second buffer contains a new
	(possibly incomplete) header.  Pointers are switched, the complete
	header processed, and the header loop continues until the end of
	header is detected.

	Here is a new `collect.c' which does the above.  I've tested it
	on a variety of headers as well as by going thru the algorithm
	by hand -- we've been running it here for several days without
	any problem.
