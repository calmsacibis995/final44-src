Subject: uids/gids not properly typed in sendmail v5.61
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/sendmail.h  4.3BSD tahoe
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	uid/gid improperly defined as short, should be uid_t/gid_t 
	(ie unsigned short on a 4.3 vax)
Repeat-By:
	watch it break with uid's greater than >32767.  .fowards are 
	no longer obeyed.  Other stuff probably also breaks.
Fix:
(line number may vary...)
