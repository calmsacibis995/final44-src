Subject: overlay function in curses (fix)
Index: 	usr.lib/libcurses 4.3BSD

Description:
	The curses overlay function does not overwrite things
non-destructively as advertised in the manual page and document. It does
so destructively.
	
Repeat-By:
	
#include <curses.h>

main()
{
	WINDOW	*w1, *w2;
	int	i,j;
	initscr();

	w1 = newwin (10,10,0,0);
	w2 = newwin (10,10,4,4);

	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		for (j = 0; j < 10; j+=2) {
			mvwaddch (w1,i,j-1,'1');
			mvwaddch (w2,i,j,'2');
		}
	}
	wrefresh (w1); wrefresh (w2);
	sleep (1);
	overlay (w1,w2);
	endwin();
}

Fix:
	Removing lines 40-45 from overlay.c should do it. This code is about
half of the entire overwrite() function (cf. overwrite.c) and destroys the
second window before there has been a chance to see if the character being
copied is a space or not.
