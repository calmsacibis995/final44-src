Description:

Sendmail ignores anything past a '\0' (NULL) character on a line in the
body of a message.  In our case, I've only tried this in cases where the
message also went across the network, so it's possible that the problem
only occurs when SMTP is being used, but this seems unlikely to me.

RFC-822 doesn't say that NULL is disallowed in messages.  It says that
the body may be any ASCII character, and a comment in section 3.3
indicates that this includes NULL.

Repeat-By:

Use a text editor to create a file that contains a NULL character, and
then try to mail that file.  Everything from the NULL to the following
newline will be midding.

Fix:

Don't use C string functions on lines in the message.  Use arrays and
explicit lengths.
