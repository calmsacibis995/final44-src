Subject: possible reference to uninitialized variable in openmailer
Subject: possible bug in non-clever SMTP delivery, sendmail 5.61
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/deliver.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	From looking at the code in deliver.c, it seems to me that if
	'clever' isn't true, one could end up using uninitialized data
	in the MxHosts array.

Repeat-By:
	I'm not sure, as I'm not familiar with the code, and I'm not certain
	what code paths might lead one to this destination.  If 'clever' is
	not true in the deliver routine, the sendoff routine is called.
	Sendoff calls openmailer, which references the MxHosts array.  From
	what I can see with grep, the only place where MxHosts gets set is
	in getmxrr, which is only called if 'clever' is true.

	I'm not sure that anything uses the non-clever code path, or that
	there isn't something else going on such that getmxrr gets called
	before taking the non-clever code path through deliver.  I did
	think that the discrepancy was worth pointing out, so that someone
	better-versed in the guts of sendmail (and with a stronger stomach)
	could take a look...
