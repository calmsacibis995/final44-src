Subject: $[ and $] don't work properly in sendmail 5.61 [FIX]
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/parseaddr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When used to canonicalize hostnames (as opposed to turning IP
	addresses into hostnames), the $[ and $] operators fail to use the
	domain search features of the resolver.  This problem occurs only
	when sendmail is acting as a SMTP client; these operators function
	properly in test mode (-bt).

Repeat-By:
	Use a sendmail config file that tries to canonicalize hostnames.
	Run some addresses through it, and note that they seem to be
	canonicalized properly.  Try to deliver to those same addresses,
	and watch the canonicalization fail.

	Alternatively, read the code in deliver.c and domain.c.  Just below
	the 'Call the mailer' comment, we turn off RES_DEFNAMES and
	RES_DNSRCH.  When we call smtpdata (and send the header), we may end
	up going through rules that use $[ and $], and thus call
	maphostname.  Because the default domain and domain search flags are
	still off, maphostname won't actually do anything useful with
	anything other than an IP address.

Fix:
	Two possibilities come to mind.  First, RES_DEFNAMES and RES_DNSRCH
	could be turned on before smtpdata is called.  Alternatively,
	maphostname could force these flags to be on, and turn them off again
	if necessary.  I've chosen the latter approach, as it seems to me
	(though I have not thought about it too hard) that we always want
	these flags to be on when trying to canonicalize.  Diffs for this
	change are below.  Your line numbers will probably vary.

	-Steve
