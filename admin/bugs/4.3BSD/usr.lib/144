Subject: Possible RFC 822-ish bug in sendmail's crackaddr()
Date: Mon, 08 May 89 11:11:33 -0400
From: steve@umiacs.UMD.EDU
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/headers.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	I think that sendmail isn't dealing correctly with angle-brackets
	inside of comments.  For example, consider the following address:

	(seen all on the same line, without the backslash)
	From: heckman@cipher \
	(Timothy M. Heckman <rutgers!ucsd!dcdwest!cipher!heckman@mimsy.umd.edu>)

	Sendmail will consider the stuff in the angle-brackets to be the
	address part.  If I'm understanding RFC 822 correctly, though,
	a comment is a '(' followed by any character that isn't a
	'[', ']', '\', or a CR, followed by a ')'.  Thus, the stuff
	in the angle-brackets should be ignored, and it's the 'heckman@cipher'
	that is the address part.

Repeat-By:
	Look at the code in crackaddr() in headers.c.  The code looks
	explicitly for angle-brackets without looking to see whether or
	not they're in parentheses.

	This can be fixed easily (with some kludge to keep track of whether
	or not we're in a comment), I suppose.  I suspect that it would be
	better to rewrite the whole routine to do a more proper, RFC 822-
	conformant parse.  If I find the time to do either, I'll submit
	this bug report again with the fix attached.
