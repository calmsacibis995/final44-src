Subject: sendmail-5.61 incorrectly handles MX records with equal precedence
Index: usr.lib 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@berkeley.edu

Description:

	I was just looking up the source to sendmail-5.61 to see why the
mail load is not being evenly distributed between my two hosts pointed to
by MX records with the same preference level.  In domain.c, the MX records
are sorted by preference with a special case if the preferences are identical.
The condition is as follows:

	if ((prefer[i] > prefer[j]) ||
		(prefer[i] == prefer[j] && rand() % 1 == 0) {
			...SWAP ENTRIES...
	}

rand() is not guaranteed to be random in the lowest bits as random() is
suppose to be, but shouldn't the test be (rand() & 01) or (rand() % 2)? 
(rand() % 1) is always 0!
	Not only does rand() % 1 always return 0, not only does rand() & 1
alternate between 0 and 1 regularly at each call (as long as the load is
balanced it doesn't really matter), but since sendmail is called directly
by Mail, the random number generator is reset to the same value each time
(for both rand() and random()), i.e there is no call to srandom() with the
PID or time-of-day.
	This appears to be the only use of a random number generator within
sendmail so only one MX record of equal precedence will be used assuming that
the records are always returned in the same order at each DNS resolver call.
The only saving grace would be if a queued message has the MX host
re-calculated by the daemonized sendmail if it ever needs to handle the
message, but with (rand % 1) this is irrelevent in sendmail-5.61.

Repeat-By:

	Notice that all mail to a hostname with two equal MX preferences
is always delivered to only one of the addresses.

Fix:

	1) Change "rand % 1" to "rand & 1"
	2) No matter which random number generator is used (rand() or
random()), use the appropriate seed initializer call during the initial
startup (in main.c?).
