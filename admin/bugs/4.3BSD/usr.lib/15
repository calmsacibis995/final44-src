Description:
This is more of a request for information than it is a complaint.
The 4.3 math functions have been considerably improved.  
From my point of view, there is still one weakness, which is that, to compute
single precision value, you compute the double precision and convert
back to single precision.  At Encore, where feasible, we have provided both
single and double precision versions of math routines, in order to increase 
performance.  We have been able to do this, for many things, by using the 
published tables of coefficients.  With the 4.3 math libraries, it is not
possible to do this, because you are using coefficients that you have
derived yourselves.  Since we would like to maintain
algorithmic correspondance between our single and double versions,
we would like to see if we could get access to (derivation of) coefficients
for the algorithms used in the math libraries that yield different
amounts of precision .  Of particular interest are coefficients for log
that yield 24 bits of precision.
