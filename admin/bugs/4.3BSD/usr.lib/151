Subject:  Bug in sendmail (up to v5.61) handling of owner-list in alias file
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/deliver.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	I haven't tested it, but a bug I reported with the original 4.3BSD
	sendmail still appears to be there.  Briefly, incoming mail to 
	mailing lists is handled correctly in a case-insensitive fashion.
	So mail coming in addressed to say 'Ad-Tecgp' will find and use the
	ad-tecgp line in the alias file with no trouble.  However, if there
	is an error in sending the message to a list user, sendmail will
	look for owner-Ad-Tecgp instead of owner-ad-tecgp to send a problem
	report.
Repeat-By:
	Create a mailing list alias with a bogus user.  Send a message to
	the list, using a mixture of cases in the To: line.  See the sender
	get the error message instead of owner-thelist.
Fix:
	Heres a context diff on sendmail/src/deliver.c
