Subject: lpq can spoof remote lpd into doing lprm
Index: 	usr.lib/lpr/{displayq,lpq}.c 4.3BSD

Description:

	lflag in lpq.c is incremented whenever -l occurs on the command
	line of lpq.  This variable is then passed to displayq(), which
	does not check its value.  This value is then added to command
	3 (short queue) to (normally) get 4 (long queue).

	If two -l's are typed, lflag == 2, format == 2, and the remote
	lpd gets sent command 5 (remove job).  Any user that knows the
	protocol can then remove jobs from remote queues at will:

	lpq -l -l person [ users ] [ jobs ]

	sends an rmjob command to the remote lpd as if person had run
	lprm.

Repeat-By:

	Have one user print a job to a remote printer.  Then have
	another user on the same machine as the first user run:

	lpq -Premoteprinter -l -l firstuser firstuser

	And the first user's job(s) will be removed from the print
	queue.

Fix:

diff displayq.c.orig displayq.c
127c127
< 		(void) sprintf(line, "%c%s", format + '\3', RP);
---
> 		(void) sprintf(line, "%c%s", format ? '\4' : '\3', RP);
diff lpq.c.orig lpq.c
88c88
< 				lflag++;
---
> 				lflag = 1;
