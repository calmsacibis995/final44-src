Subject: sprintf defn in llib-port not quite right
Index: usr.lib 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The definition of sprintf in llib-port returns "s", which isn't
	an int.  
Repeat-By:
	Rebuild lint, watch it complain about llib-port.
Fix:
	Return an int.  llib-lc had the same problem, but it's fixed
	on okeeffe.
