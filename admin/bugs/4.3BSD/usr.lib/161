Subject: crash bug in sendmail 5.64 with fix
Cc: karl@IMA.IMA.ISC.COM

Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src/conf.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	sendmail 5.64 aborts when ported to a 386
	(running AT&T UNIX Sys V.3 ISC version 2.2) with 

		Jul 26 18:00:10 localhost sendmail[953]: NOQUEUE: SYSERR: Out of memory!!

Repeat-By:
	/usr/lib/sendmail -bz				# to freeze, then
	/usr/lib/sendmail -v person@place.domain	# to crash

Fix:
	The problem is that the freeze-file thaw code uses brk(2) and
	its nasty friends with abandon.  thaw assumes that there have
	been no malloc's done before it, since it is going to replace
	whatever malloc arena is there with a previously frozen
	incarnation.  5.64 calls

		main (line 186) ->
		setdefaults ->
		setdefuser ->
		newstr ->
		xmalloc ->
		malloc

	before calling the thaw code.  This is the only call to malloc
	before the thaw code.  It took us a few hours to figure out why
	the malloc arena was all of a sudden full of a thousand valid
	malloc'd entries without hitting the malloc breakpoint.

	Rather than rewriting the freeze/thaw code (the right solution)
	to not use brk, I have included a patch to fix setdefuser so it
	doesn't call malloc.  This is kludgy, but no worse than
	previous versions of sendmail.
