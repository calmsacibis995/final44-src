Subject: makewhatis failes if a directory is empty
Index: 	usr.lib/makewhatis.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	If one of the directories in /usr/man is empty, makewhatis
	barfs because getNAME gets passed the file name "*.*", which
	it can't deal with.
Repeat-By:
	as root:

		cd /usr/man
		mv mann Omann
		mkdir mann
		/usr/lib/makewhatis

	Of course, when you're finished

		rmdir mann
		mv Omann mann
Fix:
	It can be argued that this should be fixed in getNAME, but
	here's my context diff for /usr/src/usr.lib/makewhatis.sh

Subject: /usr/lib/makewhatis problem update
Index: 	usr.lib/makewhatis.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	Well, my submession of 30 minutes ago had a bug.  Of course.
	(God I hate having two shells).
Repeat-By:
	If you run it as I sent it, whatis will be empty
Fix:
	Change the line (in my submission) that says
		l=*.*
	to
		l=`echo *.*`
