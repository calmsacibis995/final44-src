Subject: spell messes up on millions
Index: 	usr.lib/spell 4.3BSD

Description:
	spell will claim that millions is misspelled if there are
	other words misspelled in the file, but not if there are no
	misspelled words.
Repeat-By:
	try
		% spell
		millions
		^D
		%
	vs.
		% spell
		fred
		millions
		^D
		%

	In the first case, spell will print no output.  In the second,
	it will report both "fred" and "millions".
