Subject: Missing profile directories break make
Index: 	/usr/src/{lib,usr.lib}/Makefile 4.3BSD
Index: 	usr.lib/Makefile 4.3BSD

Description:
	Some of the profiled directories in the trees /usr/src/lib and
	/usr/src/usr.lib are missing. This causes makes in those directories
	to die trying to move things into them.
Repeat-By:
	cd /usr/src/lib; make
Fix:
	Make the correct set of directories.
