Subject: lprm does not work with remote printers
Index: 	usr.lib/rmjob.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When the printcap entry for a printer contains both the lp
	and rm fields for a remote printer, lprm will not remove
	jobs from the remote printer queue.
Repeat-By:
	Create a printcap entry with both lp and rm defined, e.g.

	qms|ps|postscript|PostScript|qms1200a PostScript printer:\
		:lp=/dev/qms:rm=cgl.ucsf.edu:rp=qms:\
		:br#9600:rw:fc#0000374:fs#0000003:xc#0:xs#0040040:mx#0:sf:sb:\
		:sd=/usr/spool/qms:\
		:if=/usr/local/lib/ps/psif:\
		:of=/usr/local/lib/ps/psof:\
		:gf=/usr/local/lib/ps/psgf:\
		:tf=/usr/local/lib/ps/pstf:\
		:nf=/usr/local/lib/ps/psnf:\
		:af=/usr/adm/qms-acct:\
		:lf=/usr/adm/qms-errs:

	Login to any machine other than cgl.ucsf.edu.  Submit a job to
	the qms queue, and try removing it.
Fix:
	Add the same code that appears in printjob.c into rmjob.c.  A
	context diff follows:
