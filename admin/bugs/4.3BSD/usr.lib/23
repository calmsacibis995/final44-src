Subject: vgrind puts keywords in italics
Index: 	usr.lib/tmac/tmac.vgrind 4.3BSD

Description:
	Despite documentation to the contrary, the -mvgrind macros put
	keywords in the same font as comments (2, which is to say
	italics).  The string +K, which is used to enter the proper
	font for keywords, is defined (in the end-comment macro -C) to
	be \f2.

	I made a change reminscent of this to vgrind when I was working
	there, but the code checked to make sure it was in nroff before
	doing this, when it would cause keywords to be underlined.

Repeat-By:
	% cat > t.c
	/* this is a comment */
	int i;
	^D
	% vgrind t.c

	Observe that the keyword "int" is in italics.

Fix:

	The following context diff fixes it.  It should be noted,
	however, that using italics for keywords in nroff, so that they
	get underlined, is questionable, since many nroff printers can
	embolden with overstriking.  I don't know of a way to test for
	this, however, and at least italics will keywords underlined on
	virtually all nroff output.  In any case, font 3 (bold) should
	be use in all troff output.
