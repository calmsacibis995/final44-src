Subject: sendmail changes in 5.45

Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/parseaddr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	I've noticed a modification to 4.3bsd's sendmail (version 5.45),
	and also SUN 3.0 sendmail, which I consider to be a serious mistake.
	This concerns the rulesets which the user part of the resolved
	transport address goes through after returning from ruleset 0.

	To clarify:  4.12 and 4.40 did this :-

          address ---> [3]->-[0] --->  { mailer, host, user }
                                                        |
						        `---> [4] -->

	5.45 does this :-

          address ---> [3]->-[0] --->  { mailer, host, user }
                                                        |
						        `-> [2]->-[R]->-[4] -->


	("R" is the header recipient ruleset)

	I consider it a mistake to make the assumption that transport addresses
	have to be in the same format as header addresses; for example, uucp
	mail should (!) use bang form transport addresses (i.e. in the rmail
	command line) whilst using RFC822 style addresses in the headers.

	This will cause problems with the UK-sendmail configuration compiler
	which is why I am eager to see this changed.

Fix:
	delete the offending lines in buildaddr()/parseaddr.c

>        /* rewrite according recipient mailer rewriting rules */
>        rewrite(++tv, 2);
>        if (m->m_r_rwset > 0)
>                rewrite(tv, m->m_r_rwset);
         rewrite(tv, 4);
