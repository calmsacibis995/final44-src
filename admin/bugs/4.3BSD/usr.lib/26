Subject: Atrun may write indefinite mail message on some machines.
Index: 	usr.lib/atrun 4.3BSD

Description:
	On machines that do not support signed characters and that
	have compilers that mask off the high order bits of a char
	variable, the C code
		char ch;
		...
		while ((ch = fgetc(errptr)) != EOF) {
			fputc(ch,mailptr);
			...
	will looop forever because "ch" will never equal EOF (-1).
	Atrun has this construct in the function sendmailto(). This will
	lead to a clogged file system given the conditions described above
	and the detection of an error condition by atrun.
Repeat-By:
	% at 1300
	at> garbage-command
	at> ctl-d
Fix:
	Change
		char ch;			/* scratch variable */
	to
		int ch;				/* scratch variable */
	in the function sendmailto().
