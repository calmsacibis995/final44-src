Subject: Sendmail list ownership is case sensitive
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/deliver.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Although sendmail will match recepient addresses in a case
	insensitive manner, list ownership (owner-somelist) is case
	sensitive.  This can cause problems when mail comes in to a
	list with problems, since the error messages can go back to the
	sender rather than the list maintainer.  This is not good.
Repeat-By:
	create a list called ad-tecgp (for example) with a bad remote recipient
	on it.  Create owner-ad-tecgp as an alias for errors on the mailing
	list to go to.  Send mail to Ad-Tecgp (note the caps) or some other
	combination of upper and lower case.  The person who is 
	owner-ad-tecgp will not receive any mailer-daemon messages,
	the senders will. The senders will (rightly) complain.
Fix:

	In the sendmail src directory, we want to patch the file deliver.c
	to map the owner-somelist to lowercase before it tries to look it
	up.  Sendmail already provides a function makelower() to do this
	for us.  I don't claim to understand sendmail, but I don't think
	this should hurt anything else:
