Subject: sendmail drops core
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/envelope.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	Sendmail core dumps if queued mail has a non-existent local user as a
	sender (e.g. postmaster) in 4.3 sendmail, 4.2 sendmail did not have
	this bug.  getpwname returns NULL, but it isn't checked.

Repeat-By:
	startup sendmail in smtp mode (mailq -bs) and type
	"mail from: <postmaster>" Now look in /usr/spool/mqueue where you'll
	find a sendmail core file whose backtrace shows that it died in
	setsender().

Fix:
	Here's the quick fix I came up with, but I think Eric might have a
	better solution:

diff  -r1.3 envelope.c
390a391
> 	register struct passwd *pw;
397a399
> 	extern struct passwd *getpwnam();
450,454c452,453
< 	if (CurEnv->e_from.q_mailer == LocalMailer)
< 	{
< 		register struct passwd *pw;
< 		extern struct passwd *getpwnam();
< 
---
> 	if (CurEnv->e_from.q_mailer == LocalMailer
> 	&& (pw = getpwnam(CurEnv->e_from.q_user)) != NULL) {

< 		pw = getpwnam(CurEnv->e_from.q_user);
