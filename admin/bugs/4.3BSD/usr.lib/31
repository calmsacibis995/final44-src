Subject: problem with adb scripts setproc and findproc
Index: usr.lib/adb/{setproc.nxt,findproc.nxt} 4.3BSD

Description:
	Adb scripts setproc and findproc malfunction.

Repeat-By:
	Using 'adb -k /vmunix /dev/mem', select a valid process id and
	issue the adb command '0tpid$<setproc'. Adb will wander through
	what appears to be a rather strange set of process id's, then
	stop without locating the desired process.

Fix:
	In the files setproc.nxt and findproc.nxt, line 4 is used to
	find the address of the next process table entry. However, the
	offset 164 is incorrect, and should be changed to 160.
