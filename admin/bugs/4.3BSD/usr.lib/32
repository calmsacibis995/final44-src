Subject: MX support for sendmail uses the wrong hostname to prevent looping
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/deliver.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The MX support suppresses loops by stripping all MX records of
	lower or equal preference than the current host; the current host
	name is found in the w macro.  If the w macro isn't set to the
	host's domain name then the loop suppression fails.

Repeat-By:

	Here are the sendmail.cf lines that contributed to the problem:

		Dwcgl
		Dj$w.ucsf.edu

	Here are the nameserver records that contributed to the problem:

		cgl		in	a	192.5.49.1
				in	wks	192.5.49.1 tcp smtp
				in	mx	0	cgl

		socrates	in	a	192.5.49.7
				in	wks	192.5.49.7 tcp smtp
				in	mx	0	socrates
				in	mx	10	cgl

	With the above setup, socrates.ucsf.edu being down, and a .forward
	file on cgl which forwards mail to socrates, the following will
	happen:

Fix:
	The one character fix is to use the j macro, "the official domain
	name for this site," as the host name to prevent MX looping instead
	of the w macro.
