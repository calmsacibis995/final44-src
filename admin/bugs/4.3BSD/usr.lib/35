Subject: makewhatis breaks for '-'
Index: usr.lib/makewhatis.sh 4.3BSD

Description:
	makewhatis does not generate correct whatis entries for man pages that
	have a '-' character in the name, such as L-devices (5).
Repeat-By:
	Do a "man L-devices", a "whatis L-devices" and a "man -k devices".  The
	output of the three commands does not agree.
Fix:
	The sed script in makewhatis.sh needs to be fixed.
	This also means the resolver.5 man page needs to be fixed as it has a
	bogus NAME entry.  The format should be "name \- description" but
	instead it is just "description"
