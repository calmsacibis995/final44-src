Subject: sendmail lockfiles aren't being removed
Index: usr.lib 4.3BSD

Description:
	lf files get left in /usr/spool/mqueue after sendmail has given
	up trying to deliver.  When sendmail -q is run, the mail is 
	ignored and doesn't get out. 
Repeat-By:
	I don't know.  It happens frequently, but I havn't been able to
	nail down just what causes it to happen.  I guess, but do not
	know that the problem occures when the message is first queued.
