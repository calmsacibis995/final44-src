Subject: Table of contents macros fail with DWB 2.0
Index: usr.lib/ms/s.toc 4.3BSD (maybe others)

Description:
	The new DWB 2.0 (documenters workbench) ditroff will not handle
	the .XS .XA .XE and .PX macros as they are supplied in the 4.3
	distribution.  The problem appears to be a missing "\" character
	in two of the macros.  The solution given below works with the
	old DWB 1.0 and the distributed "troff".

Repeat-By:
	Create a file with the following -

Start of test...
.XS i
some text
.XA 1
some text
.XA 5
some text
.XE 
.PX
End of test... goodbye

	and then process it by "cat file | ditroff -ms".
Fix:

	Change the two occurances of the line (in /usr/lib/ms/s.toc)

.if !^G\\*(XL^Gno^G \\\a\\\t\\\*(XL

	to
		      
.if !^G\\*(XL^Gno^G \\\\a\\\\t\\\*(XL

	Note the extra "\" before the 'a' and the 't'.
