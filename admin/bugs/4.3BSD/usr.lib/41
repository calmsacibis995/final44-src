Subject: Curses doesn't seem to scroll properly
Index: usr.lib/curses 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	This is either a bug in the curses package or one in the documentation
	(becuase if it's not a bug it should be documented). I can't get
	curses to scroll a window properly when I type a newline in
	a window. To be more precise, it indeed scrolls but it doesn't
	clear the bottom line of the window as it should.

	I've also noticed a second scroll-related problem. The first
	time that the window scrolls, the border gets messed up (that is
	a bogous character magically appears in it). As the border isn't
	actually a part of the window that's being scrolled, this seems
	to be a bug as well.

	My program looks like this:

	#include <curses.h>

	WINDOW	*wnew( lines, cols, y_start, x_start )
	{
		/* This routine works just like the newwin() except that the
		 * window has a box around it that won't be destoyed by
		 * writes to the window. It accomplishes this feat by creating
		 * two windows, one inside the other, with a box drawn in
		 * the outer one.
		 */

		WINDOW *outer, *inner;

		outer = newwin(lines,   cols,   y_start,   x_start);
		box	 ( outer, '+', '+' );
		wrefresh ( outer 	   );

		return newwin( lines-2, cols-2, y_start+1, x_start+1 ); 
	}

	main()
	{
		WINDOW	*win1, *win2;
		char	str[128];
		int	c;

		initscr();	/* Initialize curses			*/
		noecho();	/* Echo off (it screws up the screen)	*/
		crmode();	/* Put terminal into CBREAK mode	*/

		win1 = wnew(10, 20,  0, 0 );
		win2 = wnew(10, 20, 11, 21);

		wprintw(win1, "This is window one, doo wha\n" );
		wrefresh( win1 );
		wprintw(win2, "This is window 2.\nPress a key to continue \n" );
		wrefresh( win2 );

		c = wgetch(win2);
		wmove   (win1, 5, 0 );
		wprintw (win1, "Got %c, 0x%x\n", c, c );
		wprintw (win1, "Type stuff ('q') to exit");
		wrefresh(win1);

		scrollok( win1, TRUE );

	/****>>> The window doesn't scroll when I use the following loop. <<<**/

		while( (c = wgetch(win1) & 0x7f) != 'q' )
		{
			waddch( win1, c );
			wrefresh( win1 );
		}

	/**********************************************************************/

		move(23,0);
		refresh();
		endwin();
	}

Repeat-By:
	Compile the above program with "cc name.c -lcurses -ltermlib" and then
	type a.out. It will prompt for a character, type it. The cursor 
	jumps to the other window and you're prompted again. Characters that
	you type will be echoed to the window but it cursese leaves junk on
	the bottom line when it scrolls. Also, the character that you typed
	to change windows magically appears in the left-hand border of the
	window that just scrolled. Type a 'q' to exit the program.
