Subject: lpd does not handle filter error messages as advertised
Index: usr.lib/lpr/printjob.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	According to the documentation, lpd now mails back filter error
	messages to the user when the filter exits with FILTERERR (2).
	The log file as specified in /etc/printcap (lf entry) is ignored.
	The fix below fixes the mail-back problem and also writes the
	errors to the log file.

Repeat-By:
	Create a C program which writes a message to the standard error
	and then does an exit(2).  Install this as a filter (I used tf).
	Print a job that will use this filter.  Observe that the mail
	does not arrive.  Print it again with the -m flag and the mail
	indicates that the job had errors but not what they were (the
	message in the C program was not given).  Note the log file
	has not been modified.

Fix:
	Diffs follow:
