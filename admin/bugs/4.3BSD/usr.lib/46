Subject: CURSES function "getcap"
Index:  usr.lib/libcurses/cr_tty.c 4.3BSD

Description:
        Any call to "getcap", overrides the areas, assighnd by preveus calls,
        thus, even a single call to "getcap", may override the sequences which
        are stored in the built-in sequences vars (i.e. HO, DL, ND etc.).
Repeat-By:
        Simply call "getcap" about ten times, and check the value of, e.g. DL
        which will be alterd to the value returnd by "getcap"
Fix:
   The cause of the problem is the fact that when "getcap" calls "sgtty", it
   allways sendes him the same storge adress (presented by "aoftspace").

   I will now include, my version of getcap, calld "get_sequence", in which,
   the problem is solvd.

char *get_sequence(capcode)

     char *capcode;
     {
     char *temp1,
          *temp2,
          *into;

     temp1 = (char *) malloc(2048);
     temp2 = (char *) tgetstr(capcode,&temp1);

     if (! temp2)
        return (0);

     into = (char *) malloc(strlen(temp2)+1);
     strcpy (into,temp2);

     free(temp1);

     return (into);
     }
