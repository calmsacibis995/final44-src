Subject: getcap function in curses is destructive
Index: usr.lib/cr_tty.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The getcap function in the new curses is unuseable because the
	aoftspace variable is reset to _tspace after zap has been called.
	Thus when getcap() is called, the capability overwrites one or more
	of those already stored by the curses package.
Repeat-By:
	#include <curses.h>
	main()
	{
		initscr();
		/* AL is the first string capability stored in zap()
		 * so it gets overwritten first by getcap
		 */
		if (strcmp (getcap("cm"), AL) == 0) {
			printf ("al == cm\n");
		}
		endwin();
	}
Fix:
	If you remove the 'aoftspace = _tspace;' line after the call to
	zap() in setterm(), getcap() should be useful again.
