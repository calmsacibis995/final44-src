Subject: a bug in curses' newwin() routine
Date: 10 Nov 85 08:41:52 PST (Sun)
From: Adam R de Boor <deboor@ucbbuddy>

Index: 	usr.lib/libcurses/newwin.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	On line 63 of this file, It seems that curses is malloc'ing
	four times as much memory as needed for each line of a window.
	The formula it uses is:

			nc * sizeof win->_y[0]

	where 'nc' is the number of columns in the window and 'win'
	is a WINDOW *. To me, and to the compiler (it seems), _y[0]
	is a char * rather than the char which is sought for.
Repeat-By:
	char **_y; main(){printf ("%d\n", 80 * sizeof _y[0]);}
Fix:
	make it 'nc * sizeof win->_y[0][0]' or whatever.

	This isn't really a 'bug' but I don't think it's very good.
