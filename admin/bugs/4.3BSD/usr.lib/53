Subject:        Sendmail treatment of MX's with equal preference values
Index:          usr.lib/sendmail 4.3BSD
Message-Id:     <870707.185955z.01262.wales@DIANA.CS.UCLA.EDU>

Description:
	When Sendmail gets multiple MX records for a destination host
	name, and said MX records have equal preference, it appears
	that the MX records are always used in the same order as they
	appeared in the reply from the name server.
	    I think it would be better if Sendmail would randomize MX
	records with the same preference value, so that the load would
	be spread out among all the listed hosts instead of always being
	sent to the "first" host.
	    Here at UCLA, for example, we wanted to have incoming mail
	to CS.UCLA.EDU spread out among several hosts, by listing them
	all via MX records with equal preference.  This doesn't work in
	practice, though; virtually all mail ends up going to the host
	listed in the *first* MX record for CS.UCLA.EDU.
	    Note that, when multiple MX records for a domain name have
	the same preference value, the host sending mail is free to use
	any one of the equal-preference hosts at will.  Hence, what I am
	suggesting is definitely permitted by the domain system.
Repeat-By:
	Identify a domain whose name server data has multiple MX records
	with equal preference values.  Send lots of messages to that
	domain.  Observe that all the SMTP connections are being made to
	the host listed in the first MX record for the domain.
Fix:
	Two possibilities.
	    One way is to modify the code in "domain.c" (in the loop
	headed by the comment "sort the records", near line 170 of ver-
	sion 5.54), to randomize the sorting when records have identical
	"prefer" values.  There are many possible ways to do this --
	possibly using the Sendmail process ID and/or a time stamp to
	boggle the sorting.
	    Another approach might be to modify the name server (Bind)
	to randomize the order in which MX records are sent out in a
	reply datagram.  I will make this suggestion to Doug Kingston
	at BRL, since he is currently actively involved in making
	improvements to the name server.
	    Doing *both* fixes wouldn't hurt.
