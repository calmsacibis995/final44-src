Subject: The calculation of the "extra byte" in libplot/t4014 is wrong
Index: usr.lib/libplot/t4014/subr.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The calculation of the "extra byte" does not agree with the
	tek 4014 manual page (and fails to work). The problem is
	clealy the lack of parens in the expression (see page F-4,F-5
	in the tektronix 4014 user manual).
Repeat-By:
	Programs that use 4094 resolution (12 bit addressing) fail.
Fix:
	The table "F-2" in the textronix manual shows the extra byte
	as follows:
		MSB			LSB
	bits:	4	3	2	1
		--------------------------
		Y2	Y1	X2	X1

	Where Y2,Y1 are bits 1 and 2 of Y and X2,X1 are buts 1 and 2 of X.

	However the line in subr.c that calculates this is:
		extra=x&03+(y<<2)&014;
	which is clearly wrong due to c precedence rules.

	The following is a context diff for the fix:
