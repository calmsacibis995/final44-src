Subject: Unhelpful mailer-daemon message (sendmail)
Index: usr.lib 4.3BSD

Description:
	I sent a piece of mail to several people on a private mailing
	list several days ago.  Today two copies of the following message
	bounced back.  This message gives me no clue as to which of the
	people on the list didn't get the original message!  I assume that
	two people didn't get it, because I got two of these.  The problem
	is that sendmail (I assume it's sendmail that generates these things)
	relies too heavily on the "transcript of session" section to give me
	the information I need.  Here's the message:

	|<text of message here>

Repeat-By:
	The mail command that started all this has the alias 'gossip' in my
	.cshrc (log in as bh on ernie) but I doubt if the problem is
	repeatable; it's probably some temporary problem on one of the other
	computers to which I was trying to send mail.
Fix:
	In addition to the transcript, the mailer-daemon message should
	include the list of not-yet-sent recipients, which can be found
	in the /usr/spool/mqueue/qfAA_____ file.  (By the way, sometimes
	these messages err in the opposite direction, telling you too many
	losing recipients: if a single sendmail run gets one hard failure
	and several host-not-responding types, the hard failure triggers a
	mailer-daemon message but all the temporary failures are reported
	as well.  This is okay for us mail experts, but frightening to users.)
