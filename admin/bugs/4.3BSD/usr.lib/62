Subject: SUGGESTION: need new field in printcap(5): dv=device
Index: usr.lib/lpr 4.3BSD

Description:
	Various utilities need to know what kind of device a printer is.
	Currently, the best example is the need to access proper font
	files (ditroff for example).  This information can be stored in
	other places (as it is for instance in the ditroff command (a csh
	shell script)), but it can be pursuasively argued that the
	information really belongs in /etc/printcap since the ostensible
	purpose of printcap(5) is the description of printers.

	I propose that a new field, say "dv=..." as per remote(5), be added
	to encode the type of printer device.  Thus, for instance, a
	Postscript LaserWriter might have "dv=psc".
