Subject: SUGGESTION: lpr system needs separate remote host permissions file
Index: usr.lib/lpr 4.3BSD

Description:
	The lpr system currently uses /etc/hosts.equiv to determine which
	hosts to accept remote printing requests from.  This coupling is
	extremely unpleasant when you have several hosts which aren't
	centrally administered, but would like to share printing facilities.
Repeat-By:
	Look at a non centrally administered site where putting hosts in
	/etc/hosts.equiv would be disasterous, but printing facilities
	need to be shared.
Fix:
	Have the lpr system use its own separate remote printing permissions
	file.
