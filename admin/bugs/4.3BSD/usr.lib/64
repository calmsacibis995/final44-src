Subject: print job mixing
Index: usr.lib/lpr 4.3BSD

Description:
	When using the lpr/lpd system of 4.3BSD or ULTRIX32 V2.0 on a
	printer which is connected directly to the computer via an
	asynchronous line (e.g. DMF32 or DHV11), the system quite
	frequently mixes printjobs on the paper. If you use by chance
	"ps alx" while such mixture is actually done, you will see that
	more than one lpd and more than one output filter will be active
	on the same printer.

	We do not know wether a networked printer works better.

Repeat by:
	Print a couple of small or large files by using commands

		lpr file1 file2 file3
	or
		lpr file1
		lpr file2
		lpr file3

	or
		cat file1 file2 file3 | lpr

	Some of the files might be mixed on output.

The bug was already present on 4.2BSD and I hoped that it would be
fixed on 4.3BSD. Thus it is rather surprising to me that such a basic
feature as printer spooling does not work. Please forward this mail to
somebody who can be blamed.
