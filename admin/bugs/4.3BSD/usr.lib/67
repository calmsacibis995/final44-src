Subject: Too much typeout from mailq
Index: usr.lib 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: bugs@okeeffe

Description:
	It would be nice if there were an option to mailq (a/k/a sendmail)
	to list only the first few (four, say) recipients of each queued
	message.  When someone sends a few messages to an enormous mailing
	list, it takes forever to get to the message I'm really interested
	in, and sometimes I just miss it altogether in the noise.  (Here on
	ernie is where the mailing list of all CS grad students at Berkeley
	is kept, so there are always a few enormous entries in the queue.)
Repeat-By:
	mailq
Fix:
	"mailq -f" for Fast should list only the first four recipients
	of each queue file.
