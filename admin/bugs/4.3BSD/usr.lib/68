Subject: sendmail: collect() calls sfgets() with bad arg, causing infinite loop
Index:	usr.lib/sendmail/src/collect.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	When sfgets() is called with a buffer size of -1, it will never
	return.  collect() calls it with a size of -1 when it is reading
	succeeding indented header lines that have a combined length greater than
	MAXFIELD.
Repeat-By:
	Get enough mail via tcp/smtp from an IBM VMS site.  Or construct your
	own header, and send it.  Symptoms of the bug are seeing things like
	this from ps(1), even when the corresponding tcp connections are gone,
	and do not show up in netstat().

	Notice the cpu consumption.  Also, notice the hosts tend to be
	VM machines.

Fix:
	In collect()  change the code that calls sfgets() while lines
	start with space or tab to be aware of when its buffer is full.
	If it is, throw output away, which sendmail does do for the first 
	portion of each header line read.


	This is around line 115 in the collect.c I have, which is
	pretty recent (5.54).
