Subject: -me: ditroff font numbers > 4 don't work.
Index: 	usr.lib/me/tmac.e 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The -me macros were designed in the good old days when there were only
	3 fonts: Roman, Italic, and Bold; 4 if you count the special font.
	There's a hardwired assumption in the code that fonts greater than 4
	don't exist.  This assumption is actually documented: the -me manual
	says that font 8 is a pseudo font that stands for bold or italic,
	depending on various things.

	This assumption no longer holds because with ditroff you can have as
	many fonts as you like.  I've come up with a simple fix that is
	compatible with the old semantics if you're running old troff or nroff,
	but works with ditroff which has a real font 8.  In this version,
	to use the pseudofont, use a font number that doesn't exist.
Repeat-By:
	Here's a shell file that illustrates the problem.  It outputs "3 = 7",
	where it should output "7 = 7" if font 7 exists.

		#!/bin/sh
		ditroff -a -me <<'EOF'
		.nr pf 7
		.pp
		\n(.f = 7
		EOF
