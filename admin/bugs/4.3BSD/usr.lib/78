SHORT BUT DESCRIPTIVE ONE LINE TITLE:
lpr -i and -w options cause all jobs in queue to have those same options

MODULE NAME:
	lpr

BUG PORTED TO UTX? 
	yes

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
	if you send a job to the printer with either a -i or a -w option 
	and if other jobs are added to the queue before that job has finished, 
	they too will print with -i or -w options.

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:
	lpr -i33 fileA
	lpr -w44 fileB
	lpr fileC

	fileC will be printed using both the -i and -w options:
		indented 33 spaces 
		44 character page width

Neither -i nor -w options work at all in 4.3 BSD
