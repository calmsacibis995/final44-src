Subject: lpr allows normal users to unlink() arbitrary files
Index: usr.lib/lpr/lpr.c 4.3BSD
Keywords: security lpr

Description:
	This one's so horrid I don't even dare post it to netnews.

	The lpr command builds up a ``job card'' summarizing what to do.
	Users can put almost anything they want into the job card by
	embedding newlines in arguments to lpr.  In particular, they
	can embed
	    U/vmunix
	    U/etc/rc
	and so on, and lpr, running setuid root, will dutifully remove
	these files after printing the job.  Other ``job card abuse''
	may be possible.  This is bad enough to warrant immediate action.
Repeat-By:
	lpr -J"so long vmunix
	U/vmunix" /etc/fstab
Fix:
	It's silly to have lpr run setuid root at all, but when I turned
	off the setuid bit, lpr immediately choked trying to create a
	.seq file.  A long term fix would be to have lpr run setuid
	daemon, but the job card botch should be fixed in any event.
	I simply modified the card() routine in lpr.c to map newlines
	into blanks.  Your line numbers WILL differ... I've tweaked
	lpr before.

We got a report this weekend of a security bug in lpr. Looking through
your bug stuff I found it as 4.3BSD/usr.lib/80. An additional note in
the report we got that isn't in your report is that the suggested fix
will take care of local printers but not incoming jobs from other
machines (that don't have the fix) using your printer as a remote
printer. No fix suggested for that problem, other than to rewrite
everything so it doesn't have to be setuid root.
