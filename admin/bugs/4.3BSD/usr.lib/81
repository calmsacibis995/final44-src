Subject: sigblock, sigsetmask, sigpause argument type confusion
Index: usr.lib/lint/llib-lc 4.3BSD Fix

Description:
	As Keith Bostic noted in bug fix 4.3BSD/lib/24, the argument
	to sigblock has to be a long on 16 bit machines.  Yet the
	type declared in the lint library for the arguments to
	sigblock &c is (defaulted to) `int'.

Repeat-by:
	examination

Fix:
	It would probably be best to have a sigmask_t in sys/types.h;
	in any case, it would certainly help to declare the arguments
	to sigblock, sigsetmask, and sigpause.

Chris
