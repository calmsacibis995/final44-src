Subject: sendmail with MX record support refuses to accept @[a.b.c.d]...
Index: usr.lib/sendmail/src/deliver.c 4.3BSD
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	The new sendmail with MX record support fails to connect to
	directly specified InterNet addresses claiming that [a.b.c.d]
	is an unknown host.  The problem occurs in deliver() when attempting
	to connect up to the remote mailer.  If MXDOMAIN is defined, the
	host address is passed to getmxrr() which isn't prepared to deal
	with a host name of the form [a.b.c.d].

	The fix I have below simply avoids using getmxrr() if the first
	character of the host name is '['.  It might be better to make the
	fix in getmxrr(), but I don't want to touch that routine! :-)  My
	fix also fixes a bug that was introduced into deliver() when MX
	record support was added.  The reference q->q_host fails in the
	original ``#else MXDOMAIN'' with "q undefined".  Since this code
	is now always included to support the case where host[0] == '['
	I felt it necessary to fix the problem.
Repeat-By:
	Try to mail to user@[a.b.c.d] and watch it return a host unknown.
	If your sendmail.cf attempts to translate [a.b.c.d] to the canonical
	host name, then you'll have to pick a host which isn't registered
	for you destination or [a.b.c.d] will get translated to the real
	host name.
Fix:
