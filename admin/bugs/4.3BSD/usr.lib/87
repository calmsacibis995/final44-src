Summary: Chris' fix should work running at MIT for 1.5 years
Sender: daemon@bloom-beacon.MIT.EDU
Index: usr.lib/sendmail 4.3BSD

	Chris's change should work. We ran into this problem awhile ago here
(with the "expert" mailing list). I thought we posted the fix (but I guess not).
In any event here are the diffs (against the version of sendmail we were using
then). This code has been in service at MIT since November of 1986.

+ 	**  JIS: We change the global variable ReadTimeout to be 5

+ 	**      sfgets to determine how long to wait for input.
+ 	**      when we get our greeting we return ReadTimeout to its
+ 	**      previous state. IMPORTANT: The older code I replaced
+ 	**      used a separate timeout (via a setjmp and longjmp)
+ 	**      this LOSES REAL BIG if the 5 minute timeout goes off
+ 	**      for then sfgets gets its stack unwound and leaves
+ 	**      a lingering event that will eventually cause a longjmp
+ 	**      to some ancient stack history, sendmail then dies horribly.
+ 	**      This usually happens only when dealing with large mailing

+ 	**      the LAST place you want to dump core, for then the queue
