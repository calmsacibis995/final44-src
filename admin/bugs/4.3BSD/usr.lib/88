Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) lacks documentation of -me "pp" turning on "ns"
Index: usr.lib/me 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "me" macro package documentation fails to note no-space mode is
	turned on when a ".pp" macro (or any other paragraph macro) is used.

Repeat-By:
	Run this text (based on a real-life document) throught "nroff -me",
	then ask yourself what happened to the ".bp" request.

		.de SH
		.sh \\$1 "\\$2" \\$3 \\$4 \\$5 \\$6 \\$7 \\$8 \\$9
		.pp
		..
		[lots of text omitted]
		.bp
		CHRIS:  WE STILL NEED TO DO THESE SECTIONS
		.SH 1 Installation
		.SH 1 Cautions
		.SH 1 Acknowledgements
		.bp
		.ce
		Appendix: Sample Text
		The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
		.br
		[lots more text omitted]

Fix:
	Take your pick:
		1.  Document that the paragraph macros turn on no-space mode.
		2.  Don't turn on no-space mode in the paragraph macros.
		3.  Turn off no-space mode in the "bp" macro defined in
		    /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.e; after the line that reads
			.de bp
		    add the line
			.rs
		    (This is what we've done here at Elsie, but I'm not all
		    sure that it's the best course).
