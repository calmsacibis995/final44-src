Subject: savemail () may loop in state ESM_DEADLETTER
Index: 	usr.lib/sendmail/src/savemail.c 4.3BSD
	savemail.c	5.6 (Berkeley) 9/21/85

Description:
	In test mode (when e_dfp == NULL, eg,
	when no message has been collected)
	savemail () will loop in state ESM_DEADLETTER.
Repeat-By:
	/usr/lib/sendmail -bv <unknown-local-address>
Fix:
	At end of the paragraph beginning
		case ESM_DEADLETTER:
	change to some other state, eg..
			state = ESM_DONE;				/* No message was collected. */
	.. or ..
			state = ESM_MAIL;				/* Break loop. */
