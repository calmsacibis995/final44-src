Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 lpf filter fails to underline on Printronices (with fix)
#Index: usr.lib/lpr/filters/lpf.c MORE/bsd 4.3 Fix
Index: usr.lib/lpr/filters/lpf.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The output of "/usr/lib/lpf" does not cause correct underlining when
	sent to Printronix printers.

Repeat-By:
	Hook up a Printronix 600 (or similar) printer to any nearby VAX with
	an LP-11 interface.  Then type in the command

	( echo ".cu" ; echo "This is a test" ) | nroff | /usr/lib/lpf > /dev/lp

	and note that none of the letters in the generated output have been
	underlined.

Fix:
	On the Printronix, if you write out a character in a line, then end
	the line with a carriage return, then write out an underscore in the
	same column as the original character, the character gets underlined.
	But if you first output the underscore and then output the character,
	no underlining occurs.

	A "real" fix would be to ensure that underscores come out last.
	The hack described below is good enough, though, to deal with nroff
	output.
