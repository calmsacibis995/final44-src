Subject: MORE/bsd 4.3 (4/13/87) "-me" macro package muffs tables (w/fix)
Index: usr.lib/me/tbl.me 4.3BSD

Description:
	The "-me" macro package tried to work around a bug in the "tbl" command
	(reported and fixed in the previous letter) by moving the "bottom of
	page" trap back a line before handling the ".ne" requests generated
	by the "tbl" program.  This makes for problems if you ask for a short
	table and are exactly one line above the "true" position of
	the "bottom of page" trap:  the trap change moves the trap to your
	current position, and since the ".ne" request takes the amount of space
	available to be the distance "to the *next* trap position" (emphasis
	added), [nt]roff "thinks" there's enough room for the table on the
	page when there really isn't.  As a result, the table will extend into
	the bottom page margin.

Repeat-By:
	Running this input through tbl and nroff -me:
		HEAD
		.sp 49.5
		TAIL
		.TS
		box ;
		l l .
		W W
		.TE
		.nf
		X
		Y
		Z

Fix:
	After applying the previously reported to fix to tbl, remove the two
	".ch @f" lines from /usr/lib/me/tbl.me.
