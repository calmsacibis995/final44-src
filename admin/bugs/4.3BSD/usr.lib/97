lpc's man page on status command needs changes

Operating System:  	UTX/32

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM:
One of the commands of lpc is "status", in the man page, it says

	status [all] [printer ... ]

Actually, "all" cannot be recognized and you will get a error
message. The default for "status" is printing the status of
all printers.

SAMPLE BROKEN OUTPUT:

HOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:  (preferably a shell script)

SUGGESTED FIX:

CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY:

This might be considered a software bug since "all" works as an argument
for the other lpc "sub-commands".  It might be more consistent to change
the code.

Also, how does lpc work on the vax?
