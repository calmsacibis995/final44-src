Subject: 4.4bsd sh quoting bug?

C News configures its shell scripts using a shell script called subst,
which makes textual substitutions.  /bin/sh on vangogh doesn't seem to
get quoting right and as a result we are seeing incorrect behaviour of
subst.  Here's a demonstration of correct behaviour:

:; f=foo/bar
:; file="`expr \"$f\" : '.*/\\([^/]*\\)'`"
:; echo $file
bar

and here's what happens on vangogh:

: vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU; f=foo/bar
: vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU; file="`expr \"$f\" : '.*/\\([^/]*\\)'`"
: vangogh.CS.Berkeley.EDU; echo $file
0

The expr command seems to be okay; a simpler example of the same thing,
with less complex quoting, from expr(1) works.
