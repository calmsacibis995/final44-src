Subject: /bin/sh quoting error?

While configuring C News I ran across non-standard quoting behaviour
in /bin/sh within backquotes.  This is easily demonstrable:

    # /bin/sh
    $ SHELL=/bin/sh
    $ export SHELL
    $ echo `echo \\a | wc`

Most /bin/sh implementations will pass "\a" to the inner echo, and wc
will return a character count of 2.  (1 after doing the quote processing
on \a + the newline after.)  /bin/sh under BSD/386 returns 3, apparently
passing the full "\\a" to the inner echo.

This causes, for instance, all of the carefully crafted correctly
quoted sed scripts within C news (and, presumably, elsewhere) to fail
horridly, in fact making the configure files wipe out much of the
distribution that they were trying to customize.  At first I thought
it was a sed problem, but it's not.

My lazy solution was to move /bin/sh to /bin/sh.old, and link
/usr/contrib/bin/bash to /bin/sh -- bash gets it right.

Apologies if this has been reported or explained before.
