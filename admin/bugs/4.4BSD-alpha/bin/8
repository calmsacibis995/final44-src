Ah!!!  When I was porting PINE I ran into an annoying bug in the 
BSDI supplied 'sh' as well!  Looks like the same one.  PINE was trying
to launch sendmail internally to send mail in the following fashion:

  ((sendmail -oi -oem -t ; rm -rf tmpfile) & )< tmpfile

"tmpfile" was the mail message & rfc header, in /tmp.  The messages
I sent would myseriously vanish, never being sent.  When I added
debugging I discovered why: /bin/sh (which the internal routine fork'd
to execute system programs from within PINE) was executing
the "rm" command at the same time (or before?) the sendmail process,
so the input redirection was empty each time.  I had to change it
to:

  (sendmail -oi -oem < tmpfile; rm -rf tmpfile)

For it to work.  The first form works for all the other UNIXs
PINE has been ported to (many), as there were no #ifdef's in this
area.  There is now.

What manner of bourne shell is /bin/sh then (as shipped with BSDI)?
