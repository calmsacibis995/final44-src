Subject: _puts() in curses.h needs __cputchar
Index: include 4.4BSD-alpha
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@CS.Berkeley.EDU

Description:
	The _puts() macro is in the backward compatibility section of
	curses.h that is only defined if _CURSES_PRIVATE is not defined,
	and _puts() refers to __cputchar which is only prototype if
	_CURSES_PRIVATE is defined.

Repeat-By:
	#include <curses.h>

	main()
	{
		_puts(TI);
		_puts(TE);
	}

Fix:
	move the declaration of __cputchar so that it is neither in the
	backward compatibility section nor the private section of curses.h.
