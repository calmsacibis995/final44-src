Rats...this is getting embarrassing.  I believe I really truely have the
correct fix this time.  Honest!  (Next time I'll wait a day before
posting anything.)

The fopen(fname, "a+") didn't actually work either like I thought it had.
Soo...opening for read/write ("r+"), and then opening for write ("w")
if that doesn't work (if the file doesn't exist) does the trick.
I tested it running msgs(1) a few times, and removing my .msgsrc, and
repeating the whole process a few times.  I can't get it to fail anymore,
and here is my resultant patch:

*** msgs.c.orig Wed Feb 24 19:27:28 1993
--- msgs.c      Wed Feb 24 19:48:52 1993
***************
*** 397,403 ****
        }
        else
                newrc = YES;
!       msgsrc = fopen(fname, "a");
        if (msgsrc == NULL) {
                perror(fname);
                exit(errno);
--- 397,406 ----
        }
        else
                newrc = YES;
!       msgsrc = fopen(fname, "r+");
!       if (msgsrc == NULL) {
!               msgsrc = fopen(fname, "w");
!       }
        if (msgsrc == NULL) {
                perror(fname);
                exit(errno);

Original bug:

	Fseek doesn't do anything in stdio if the open was in pure
	append mode (which seems reasonable).  Fix msgs.
