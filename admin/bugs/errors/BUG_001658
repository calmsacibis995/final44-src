Subject: 4.3-reno fts code is broken

Index:	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/fts.c 4.4BSD [Fix]

Description:
	The fts routines (as used by find, and probably lots of other things)
	don't deal well with the last entry in a directory.

Repeat-By:
	Run '/usr/ucb/find / !  -type d -print' on some machine, after
	making sure that the last entry in that_machine:/ is a file rather
	than a directory.  You'll see it print two slashes on the front of
	the filename.  If the last entry is a directory rather than a file,
	and you drop the !  in that expression, you'll see two slashes on
	the start of the pathname...  and if there's a directory under that
	directory, the pathname that find prints is actually bogus.  For
	example, I made sure that /steve4 was the last thing in directory
	search order in gyre.cs.umd.edu:/.  Then I ran 'find / -type d
	-print', and I got /, //steve4, and //steve/foo back (followed by
	other stuff, of course).  Note that there is no //steve/foo; that
	should be /steve4/foo, which does exist.

Fix:
	The problem seems to be somewhere at the end of the fts_build
	routine in /usr/src/lib/libc/gen/fts.c, but I don't understand the
	full logic of the fts routines, so I'm not exactly sure what to
	change.  The change I made was as follows (line numbers probably
	vary).  I don't know whether or not this breaks anything, but it did
	fix (or make go away (-: ) the apparent problems I was having...
