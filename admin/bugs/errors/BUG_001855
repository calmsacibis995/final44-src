Subject: reporting of sendmail bugs
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU
Date: Wed, 15 Aug 90 12:35:52 EDT
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.2  PL16]

I have a few questions about reporting bugs in sendmail:

1)	What is the preferred format for submitting a bug report and/or
	patches? (e.g. do you prefer context diffs, verbal
	descriptions, etc.)
2)	Do you support the IDA enhancements, or only the
	"vanilla" 5.64 distribution.
3)	I have a few patches to facilitate compiling sendmail
	under AT&T System V UNIX(r), in addition to some genuine
	bugs. Are you interested in those patches as well, or
	would I just be wasting your time?

Thanks in advance,
