Subject: pstat fails on vax

Index: misc/pstat/pstat.c 4.3BSD-Reno Fix

Description:
	(it seems bugfiler does not accept `usr.sbin', etc, hence `misc'
	above)

	pstat fails on VAXen since not all the tty devices are always
	configured.

Repeat-By:
	Run pstat on a vax without, e.g., a qdss configured.

Fix:
	Remove the test for kvm_nlist(nl) == 0; instead, check
	nl[0].n_value != 0 afterward to see if anything got done.
