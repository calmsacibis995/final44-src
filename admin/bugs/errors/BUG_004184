Subject: Bug in sendmail 5.64 daemon.c
Cc: chris@cs.umd.edu, lidl@eng.umd.edu, petry@trantor.umd.edu

Subject: Sendmail's makeconnection passes wrong argument to inet_ntoa
Index:	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/src/daemon.c 4.3-Reno [FIX]

Description:
	When sendmail is running in debug mode, sendmail's makeconnection
	tries to print the IP address to which it's connecting.  However, it
	obtains the printable version of that IP address by handing
	SendmailAddress.sin_addr.s_addr to inet_ntoa; inet_ntoa is expecting
	a 'struct in_addr', and it's getting a u_long.  This causes problems
	(segmentation faults) on certain machines (i.e., SPARCstations
	running SunOS 4.1)

Repeat-By:
	Compile sendmail 5.64 on such a machine, then do a 'sendmail -t -v
	-d1-99.9'.  Send mail to a non-local address.  Watch sendmail blow
	its cookies.

Fix:
	Apply the diff below.  (For a change, I think these line numbers are
	from vanilla code! (-: )

	-Steve
