Subject: Possible error in gethostnamadr.c
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

Hello,

I haven't mailed to this address before, so hope I am not violating any
rules etc. If so I apologise.

Now to get to the reason for this mailing. Looking at the code for
gethostnamdr.c ( version 6.45 date 2/24/91 ) at line 166 you have
the statement

	cp += n;

This is following a call to dn_expand() which has failed (i.e. has
returned a value of -1). Now the effect of this statement would be
to backup the pointer cp, which is surely not intended. I feel
that the statement is erroneous and should be removed. 

Cheers,
Paul.
