Subject: sys/kern/tty_compat.c problem -- tty settings get changed
Reply-To: composer@Beyond.Dreams.ORG

When using the old tty compatibility code, tty settings such as character
size, parity, etc, get changed arbitrarily.  So, if you run a program which
hasn't been updated to use termios and uses the old BSD sgtty structs (of
which there are and will be many), those settings may get changed.  This is
not helpful, for example, when you're logged in via modem at communication
settings of 7-E-1 and after running one of those programs it changes to
8-N-1 on you.

The following program can demonstrate the problem.  Look at the tty settings
before and after running this.  They are supposed to be the same, but get
changed, at least when starting at 7 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

#include <sgtty.h>

main()
{
  struct sgttyb s;

  ioctl(2, TIOCGETP, &s);
  ioctl(2, TIOCSETN, &s);
}

The problem seems to be somewhere in /usr/src/sys/kern/tty_compat.c.  When
using the TIOCSETN ioctl, some of the bits are masked out, presumably
because they are already in the termios structure properly.  Given the
above sample program, this does not seem to be the case.

I haven't had time to go thru all the bits nor to track down the problem
entirely.  Ideally, use of the old tty code shouldn't arbitrarily change
any of the tty settings.

Good luck on tracking down and fixing the problem!  If I have more time
to look into it and find any more details or fixes, I'll be sure to send
off a note.

FYI...
