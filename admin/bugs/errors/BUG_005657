Hi - 

My name is Edward Fulton.  I am an engineering student at the University of 
Illinois, Champaign-Urbana.  I have two types of "dumb terminals" in my 
apartment.  They are a Hazeltine 1552 and a TeleVideo 910.  While I have 
successfully found out how to remotely log into my unix account, I am 
having great trouble using the "vi" editor with the Hazeltine.  I suspect 
that "vi" will be the only editor available to me.  Actually, I haven't been 
successful at remotely logging in with the TeleVideo terminal - it seems like 
I have to set a switch or two to receive characters on its display.  

In any case, can you tell me if I will be able to normally use the "vi" 
editor with either of these two terminals?  I noticed in a text file named 
"termcap" that you supplied a whole bunch of information for various terminals. 
What does all that stuff mean?  Thanks for any help you can supply! 

Sincerely, 

Edward Fulton
