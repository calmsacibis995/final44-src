Subject: sendmail/Mail eats colons and slashes

We're trying to get mail containing colons and/or slashes in the
addresses through (this from ucbarpa, which presumably is running
the latest and greatest Mail and sendmail) and finding it doesn't work.

Colons are being turned into dots or dot-blanks, presumably a remnant
of Berknet that no longer applies.  There appears to be a rule in sendmail.cf
in S17 and 3 other rulesets that does this, for no obvious reason.

Sample failing address:
	susan.fagan:loc=mt@att.com

Slashes appear to cause Mail to think it's a filename
and try to append to the file, producing an error message instead
of delivering the file.  sendmail seems to handle this one OK.

Sample failing address:
	mhorton/receipt@attmail.com

Thanks,
	Mark.Horton@ATT.COM
