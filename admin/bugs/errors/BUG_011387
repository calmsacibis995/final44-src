The sequence "" causes word expansion to fail under some circumstances. 
According to Posix.2 and traditional sh behavior, a null argument is
generated if a word expands to a null string and double quotes were present
(i.e.  the word is partially quoted).  The sh released with the
4.3-networking-2 BSD release does not do this; it tosses the word entirely. 

For example:

thor(3)$ recho $xxx""				<---- bash 1.12.219
argv[1] = <>

thor(3)$ sh					<---- SunOS 4.1.2 /bin/sh
thor($SHLVL)$ recho $xxx""
argv[1] = <>

thor(3)$ ksh					<---- ksh 88 something
thor(3)$ recho $xxx""
argv[1] = <>

thor(3)$ bsdsh					<---- 4.3-net-2 sh
thor($SHLVL)$ recho $xxx""
thor($SHLVL)$
