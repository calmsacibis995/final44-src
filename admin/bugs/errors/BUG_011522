Subject: usr.bin/make -- library.a:: target doesn't work properly
Date: Thu, 08 Oct 92 15:57:22 EDT

[ This was found in BSD/386 0.9.1 (gamma.1). ]

A double dependency (the double colon) without any source dependencies
should always have its commands executed.  But, when you have an archive
with its table of contents up-to-date as the target with a double colon,
make currently reports that library.a is up-to-date and doesn't run any
of the commands, though it should run them.

A simple example Makefile:

library.a::
	echo "This should always echo no matter what!"

If library.a's TOC is up-to-date, make will not echo the above line.
It should echo the line, of course.  It seems that make is checking if
library.a is up-to-date before checking for the double dependency and
realizing it should run the commands no matter what.

The routine to probably look at is Make_OODate() in make.c.

I haven't had time to poke thru to see if rearranging appropriate checks
would break anything, but this should be enough of a pointer to fix the
problem, I hope.

Good luck!
