Subject: bind RRs
References: <Added.Qb4TQwn0Bi8107SE5Y@transarc.com>

Now that RFC 1183 has come out describing some new RRs, might it be
possible for code to handle them to be folded in to the BSD
distributions (particularly 4.3 Reno)?  I'd be willing to do some
legwork and/or some coding.

		Thanks,
