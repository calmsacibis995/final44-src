Hi there,

I will try to make this as short and clear i can. I think there's something
wrong with sendmail 8.6.9 & Linux. I'm not a c-type person (because then i'd
send diffs instead of q-mark), but i still tried to track up the problem.
It is not relied to my sendmail.cf, i believe it is a true bug in the code.

Here's the problem:

Setup; Linux 1.1.92, libc4.6.27, using stock Makefile.Linux.
The box is prime.llc.org, on PPP.

Whenever i receive mail from outside, it doesn't get delivered. It is
instantly spooled in /var/spool/mqueue. I have to run a 'sendmail -q' cron
job to get the mail delivered. (bobby-sands.llc.org is used as remote here,
but it's the same from everywhere, tested :)

This is how it looks in the queue:

                Mail Queue (1 request)
--Q-ID-- --Size-- -----Q-Time----- ------------Sender/Recipient------------
NAA22469      756 Wed Feb 22 13:18 <greg@bobby-sands.llc.org>
                 (bobby-sands.llc.org: Name server timeout)
                                   <greg@prime.llc.org>


A name server timeout is kinda impossible, since there are no delays.
The next weird thing i found out is:

220-prime.llc.org Sendmail 8.6.9/8.6.9 ready at Wed, 22 Feb 1995 13:06:03 -0500
220 ESMTP spoken here
helo
250 prime.llc.org Hello bobby-sands.llc.org [199.45.69.2], pleased to meet you
mail from: greg@LLC.org
250 greg@LLC.org... Sender ok
rcpt to: greg@prime.LLC.org
250 greg@prime.LLC.org... Recipient ok (will queue)
				       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

This 'will queue' appears right away, without any delays, and you can
see the nameserver did it's job, since it already has found the ip of the 
host in the 'helo' line.

Then i remembered the warnings i had when compiling, here they are, all 
related to DNS functions:

cc -I. -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -I/usr/local/include -DNEWDB    -c daemon.c -o daemon.o

I hope you can light my candle, and i also hope i didn't disturb you
for nothing,
