I hope that this is the correct address for Mark Hittinger.  If this is a

to help - Thanks)

We have had some long standing problems with a WangDAT 2600 connected to a
MicroVAX 3100/10

1.   It fails the poweron diagnotics, thus halting the (re)boot.  A manual
boot will boot the system satisfactorally

2.   Regularly get SCSI bus errors.

Could you tell me anything more about the ROM change or level that you
mentioned in your post.

Thanks.
