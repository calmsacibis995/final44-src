Subject: Fwd: Sendmail V5.64 + IDA enhancements available for anon-FTP
References: <27271.646438395@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu>

In the last month I believe I've sent you all a copy of the same
sendmail patch that I've been using for years.  As you might recall,
this patch shrinks qf* files after successful mail deliveries,
preventing duplicate deliveries (and helping to ensure queue-processing
progress) in the event of sendmail/system crashes.  FYI: I sent the
patch to Paul Pomes (@uiuc.edu) and he finds that it works fine.

		Thanks,
		Craig

Your patch works very well.  I sent mail to a list and then watched the
qf* file slowly shrink as each recipient was dispatched.  Thanks.
