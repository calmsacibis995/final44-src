Subject: re my previous mail about sendmail 5.64 bugs

I recently mailed in complaining that sendmail 5.64 had a place
which was doing a malloc before the freeze.  There are actually
two such places, and I suppose the right way to replace them is
to move the code to after the thaw rather than by rewriting it
not to malloc.  If you're interested, I can send in diffs.
