Subject: About concept 100 terminal setup (HDS).


Hi,
   Sorry to bother you. I just ask if you know how to setup baud rate
for concept 100 terminal. The default is 300bps, it's too slow.
The terminal is so old that I can't find a person who has any idea about it.
So I send this to you, for there is c100 in termcap, I think may be you 
know how to setup.

  There is only a status bar at the bottom of the screen. If you can give
me the escape sequence, that will be very good. I can't access the status
bar from the keyboard. I think I should sent it from remote machine.


Thanks a lot.

Sincerely yours,

Biao Lu
