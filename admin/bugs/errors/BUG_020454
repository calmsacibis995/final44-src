WHERE: Wharf
WHERE: Hall of Knowledge
TOPIC: blue
	you've got to be kidding me?
Suggested correction
TOPIC: Color conventions
	blue is used to represent negatively charge objects with........
	red is used to represent ..............
	chartruse is .........

BTY the red rod in the RED Cue "looks" brown!!!!!

TOPIC:distance
If you are going to define something it seems reasonable to have the topic
being defined on the "first" page.  My immediate first thought was what does
   "the negative charge on the cloth, causes it to attract is postively 
    charged objcet"
have to do with distance?  This is discussed on page 2.  
   "the strength of the electrostatic force increases as we decrease the
    distance between the two .......

ELECTRO BUG #3

If I click on "electrostatic force" in the above text I get a again a two
page tutorial in which page 1 is basically superfulous (sp?) and then the 
program return me to the wrong place.  It does not return me to page 2-2 
of the definition of distance but returns me to the "Hall of Knowledge"
It should return me to the place where I called for the definition.  At
least that's how most reasonable hypertext systems work......

It seems to me that you're put stuff in the hall of knowledge just for the
sake of putting stuff there.  If you have COULOMB why do you need 
MICROCOULOMB.   A microcoulomb is just 10e-6 coulomb.  The difference is
in "MICRO" which is a unit of measure ........
Another example in ALL TOPICS you have 
	1e-12 coulombs
	1e-6  coulombs
why not also have 
	1e-3  coulombs    ....micro
        1e-9  coulombs    ....pico
This list can go on and on and on and on ........... In short, the hall of
knowledge is meaningless because its filled with trivia...
BTY (by the way) I didn't notice that you included 
	1e-12 farads
	1e-9  farads
	1e-6  farads
	1e-3  farads
Aren't farads as important or even more important than COULOMBS since you'll
be dealing with them whenever you use capacitors, capacitors ......
