Subject: New Zealand Daylight Saving Rule changes (*AGAIN*)
Date: Thu, 04 Oct 90 10:23:36 +1200
From: Mark Davies <mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz>

Hi,
   After last years trial extended daylight saving period (mentioned in a
bug-report about 1 year ago) the government has now adopted the extended
period and further added an additional week at the start, so the new rule
for daylight savings switchover is now 1st Sunday in Oct through to 3rd
Sunday in March.

Here is a revised entry for zoneinfo/src/australasia:

# New Zealand, from Elz' asia 1.1
# Elz says "no guarantees"

#  the 1989/90 year was a trial of an extended "daylight saving" period.
#  This trial was deemed successful and the extended period adopted for
#  subsequent years (with the addition of a further week at the start).
#  source -- phone call to Ministry of Internal Affairs Head Office.
