Subject: rp (repeat) termcap entries

Hello,
	I assume I'm writing to Kevin Layer. If not, perhaps someone
else can help me. I got this address out of a README file contained
in a termcap archive.
	I am writing a termcap based menu program, to help the
un-unix-educated deal with unix, without having to learn it.
I want to make use of the "rp" (repeat character) termcap capability,
and have done so in my program. It works fine. The problem is that
I can't find many termcap entries which support this capability.
I need to find a few commonly used ones, or my menu system will
be almost unusable for those users who are stuck with 2400bps.
So far, I've only been able to find the following:

ProTERM Special Emulation (only supported by one program on Apple //s)

WYSE 75 & 85

HDS Concept-100

Microport System Console


	That's only four fairly uncommon ones. The only one I've been
able to find a terminal program to support is Proterm Special.
	I am hoping that because you have so much experience using
and working with termcap, that you have access to termcap databases
which I do not, or perhaps even know some by heart. Are there any
other termcap entries which support repeat character? If you know of,
or can find any other ones that do, please let me know, or send them
to me at this address. Thank you very much. Sincerely,

Chris Deschu (cdeschu@nyx.cs.du.edu)

PS: if you can tell me where else to search, I'll do that too. I just
spent the last 6 hours searching the internet with archie, and ftp,
to come up with those four entries. Thanks again,
