Subject: making rsh into rexec

Subject: there is no rexec in 4BSD
Index:	ucb/rsh/rsh.c 4.3-reno

Description:
	IBM and HP systems have an rexec command that can be used with
	the rexecd daemon for doing remote execution.  On HP systems
	rexec is a link to rsh.  I saw this, scratched my head and said,
	"hmmm, I can do that too."  Here is the code.

Repeat-By:
	$ rexec server echo hi
	rexec: not found

Fix:
	Man page changes left as an exercise.  Code changes below.
	I know this is late, but perhaps it can be in the final 4.4.
