I am having problems with the 'shell's on BSD.  Perhaps these
have been fixed [in GAMMA]?

Try this script:
	#
	VARS='a b c'
	LISTS='a1 b1 c1'
	NLISTS='a2 b2 c2'
	#---------------------- START ---------------------
	a='AA'
	b='BB'
	c='CC'
	a1='AAA'
	b1='BBB'
	c1='CCC'
	a2='AAAA'
	b2='BBBB'
	c2='CCCC'
	#--------------------- END ------------------------
	# Write out the simple variables
	eval "cat <<EOF
	`for v in $VARS $LISTS $NLISTS; do echo \"\$v='\\\$\$v'\"; done`
	EOF
	"

The output should be identical to the lines between 'START' & 'END'.
'/bin/sh' (aka ash) get's is totally wrong - there is a problem with
variable substitution in the quoted strings.  '/bin/ksh' core dumps...

Any help would be appreciated.
