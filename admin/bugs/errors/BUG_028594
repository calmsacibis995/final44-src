Subject: winsize structure persisting between sessions
To: 4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU
Message-Id: <9007311324.AA14747@unix1.tcd.ie>

We are running BSD4.3 tahoe on an ICL DRS/500 (alias CCI Power 6)

When a user changes the window size:
        stty rows 36 cols 120
and then logs out, the next person to get that line (eg /dev/ttyp2)
inherits the window size, ie
        stty size
yields 36 120.  This structure should be zeroed on final close according
to the man page tty(4).
