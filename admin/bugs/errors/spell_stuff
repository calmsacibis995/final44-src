Thanks, that's one I should add to the stoplist!  (With a little
ingenuity one can find an amazing number of words that are accepted
by spell for wrong reasons.  E.g. "generaly" because spell sees that
it can be broken up as "genera+ly"; "advertize" as "advert+ize", etc.
These and many others will be added to the stoplist in the next
revisions.)

"dsgdsdoo oogdi seoosdgdi" certainly do show a lot of similarity.  I
don't know what to make of it.  Some time I should try forming more
words resembling these, and see how many of them are accepted!

There are a LOT of things wrong with spell which I, as a non-programmer,
can't do anything about.  For instance, in deciding whether to make
certain changes on adding suffixes, it only looks at the last letter
of the root, so that it accepts equally

	*fishs	   fishes
	 paths	  *pathes
	 triumphs *triumphes
	*watchs	   watches
	 days	  *daies
	*pennys	   pennies

It also has one very strange feature that has no effect given the
existing set of words, but is still baffling.  If you give it a word
like "humanity", it looks to see whether either "humane" or "human"
is acceptable, and accepts it if it finds either.  (In this case it
finds both, and is doubly happy.)  So far so good.  If you
give it something like "relativity" however, it will look for "relative"
and -- not "relativ" -- but "relatev"!  Precisely, given a word ending
in -ativ plus a suffix which can be added to roots with removal of a
final -e if there is one, it will look for bases in -ative and -atev.
Since there is nothing ending in -ativ or -atev in the wordlist this
has, as I said, no effect; but one can verify it by creating artificial
wordlists, or by using "spell -x".  I haven't been able to find any
ending other than "-at(i/e)v" with this property; e.g. it doesn't work
with "-ot(i/e)v" etc..

I wish I could find some programmer to fix some of the problems that
really affect users, and/or to track the above weirdy to its lair.

				Yours,		George
