Sun-Software-Release-Number:
	SunOS 4.0 + "General-Hy patch"

Description:
	SunOS 4.0 muffed the ending date of British Summer Time in 1988.

Fix:
	In addition to fixing the rule currently in use (from specifying the
	last Sunday in October to specifying the first Sunday after the fourth
	Saturday), the changes below provide the correct rules back to 1960.
	They apply to the "/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo/europe" file.

	And you thought the U. S. rules were bad. . .
