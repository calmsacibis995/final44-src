I don't know whether this one has been reported, but ash (/bin/sh)
has a 'feature' which prevents it from exec()ing a file if the user
isn't the owner or in the right group and execute bits aren't set
for 'other'.  This screws up for root, who can execute anything as
long as it has at least one execute bit.  The effect is that you
can't run a plain 'disklabel' command as root, since disklabel is
mode 2550 with owner bin and group operator.  My feeling is that
it's just plain wrong for ash to test mode bits for permission to
execute something -- it should just try to execute it.

Since everyone runs disklabel during installation, this could lead
to some frustration,

Donn
