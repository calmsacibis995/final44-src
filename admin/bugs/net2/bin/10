[This may be the same bug as the previous one.  The example fails on
vangogh, succeeds on a Sun.  -- Donn]

[Gamma1 problems]

Here are two problems I've found with [a]sh(1) and sed(1).  These are probably
holdovers from Beta, but just in case you didn't know about them, here they
are.    ...

[NB -- The sed bug is fixed, so I've omitted it.]

Under sh(1), the following line:
	eval 'echo sed "s/'/'\"'\"'/g" "s/[]\\\\ /g"'
correctly produced
	sed s//"/g s/[]\\ /g
on SunOS and ULTRIX, but produced
	eval: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
on BSD/386.
