Subject: ash requires a ';' in 'for i; do'
Index: bin/sh net2

[Believe it or not, this is by far the most common complaint about ash,
and probably ranks in the top ten bugs reported for the entire system.
I just tried it on vangogh and it's still there.  It's easy to see if
you run:

	$ set a b c
	$ for i do echo $i; done
	 ...

under ash and then under a real Bourne shell.  I think the Bourne
shell has a bug, but unfortunately this syntax is in widespread use
out in the real world...  -- Donn]

from Jay, about the ash problem encountered setting up Perl...

>  do
>

Jay - Please double-check that first one...I checked several sh's and
couldn't find one that allows it!  It should be:
	for filename in x*; do
Without the ";", the word "do" would be part of the word list assigned to
"filename".  With the ";", ash likes it fine, and there are lots of loops
written that way in the Perl setup.  The only form ash doesn't handle is
	for arg do
However, it will handle
	for arg; do
Not accepting "for arg do" is a bug, in practice at least, but it shouldn't
be hard to fix.

(I *AM* going to get another disk while I'm in the Bay area next week, so I
can get all the source on-line and stop saying things like "shouldn't be
hard to fix"!!!:-)
