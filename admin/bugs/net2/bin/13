[I liked this bug report so much, I'll cite it in full.  It's not
really his fault, but this is one of the funniest things I've read all
year...  I'm not sure what (if any) bugs are actually involved here.

   Installing CNews, I found a problem related with B Shell(I may have 
been reported by someone).

   The shell interprets a bach slush before a double quotation inproperly.
When it meets a combination of a back slush followed by a double quotation,
it doesn't consider it as a double quation but literally a back slush
and a double quotaion.    Similar different errors also occur.   ksh
handles it correctly.

   Furthermore, sh doesn't handle properly this:
(foo ; cd bar) < file
  where foo is a command, bar is a directory, and file is to be redirected
to foo.   B shell seems to redirect file to "cd bar".

   /bin/sh is a software by Berkeley, but it may releated to you
and I am writing this.

  Thank you.
