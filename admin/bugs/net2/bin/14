Subject: 'date' problems with /bin/sh
Index: bin/sh net2

Under the supplied /bin/sh, a user will get logged off with the following:

date ``+%H:%M:%S''

Running a second /bin/sh after logging in, and repeating the above command
results in a 'Memory fault- core dumped' and a core.sh in my directory --
thus, this is not a 'date' problem, but rather an 'sh' problem.  If you
also try this command in 'csh', there is no problem, and date works as
expected.  

What's the cause of this problem?

Thanks,

Jim
