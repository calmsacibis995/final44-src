Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

If the directory foo/bar exists the command 'cp -R bar foo' fails
with: "cp: foo/bar: not a directory."

There is also a problem with the man page not describing the solution
to the ambiguity in the command 'cp -R dir1 dir2'.

The fix is:
