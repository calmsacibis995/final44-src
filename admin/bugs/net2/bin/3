There is an input buffering bug in the /bin/sh distributed as part of the
4.3-networking-2 release.

Given the scripts sb and sc, as follows:

sb:

	echo this is sb
	exec 0< sc
	echo after exec in sb

sc:
	echo this is sc

running both `sh < sb' and `cat sb | sh' produces

this is sb
after exec in sb
this is sc

The correct output is

this is sb
this is sc

because both < and | are defined to use file descriptor 0.  sh needs to
flush its input buffers when an `exec' changes the file underlying the
file descriptor it's using to read input.
