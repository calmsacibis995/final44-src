Subject: stray CTLESC characters left by /bin/sh
Index:  bin/sh net2
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@berkeley.edu

Description:
	/bin/sh does not remove CTLESC characters when processing
	here documents with embedded variable expansions containing
	`='

	In expandhere(), evalvar() eventually calls varvalue to get
	the value of $1.  varvalue() inserts a CTLESC to escape the
	embedded `='.

	The buffer written by expandhere() is then written to the
	pipe to `cat', without performing quote removal.

Repeat-By:
	Put the following text in a file `foo':

	cat > bar <<EOF
	$1
	EOF
	od -c bar

	and run sh on it:
		/bin/sh foo a=b

	The `od' output will show a stray CTLESC ('\201') character
	before the `='.
