Hi,

I have found a bug in the login(1) program found in the bsd-sources directory
on uunet.

It seems that a normal user can get root permissions by trying
(unsuccessfully) to log in as root before giving his own userid and password.
This is without defining KERBEROS.  This is because the variable ``rootlogin''
is set but never cleared in the loop at lines 179-284.
