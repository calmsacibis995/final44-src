Subject: bug with "clearing /tmp" stuff in /etc/rc
Date: Fri, 21 Feb 92 21:51:45 PST
From: Craig Leres <leres@ee.lbl.gov>
Index: etc/rc net2

On machines that don't use mfs for /tmp, we were getting:

    find: ./.X11-unix: No such file or directory

on bootup. The problem is that find removes the directory and then
tries to visit it. Pruning directories fixes this (diff appended).
