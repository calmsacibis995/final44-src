Subject: Two bugs in the ANSI library suite.
Index: include net2

Easy to fix though.
(1)
<signal.h> is missing the definition for SIG_ERR
It should have a line:
	#define SIG_ERR (void (*)())-1

Don't make the line:
	#define SIG_ERR BADSIG
As BADSIG should not be defined when _POSIX_SOURCE is in effect.

(2)
<time.h> is missing the definition CLOCKS_PER_SECOND
It likely should be:
	#define CLOCKS_PER_SECOND CLK_TCK

And placed after a line that includes something that defines CLK_TCK as
it is defined in <limits.h>.

	CLOCKS_PER_SECOND
should be
	CLOCKS_PER_SEC
