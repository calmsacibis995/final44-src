386bsd implements execl() and friends as library functions calling a
single execve() system call.  The argument list is constructed using
malloc().  If the exec()ing process is vforked, the memory will be
allocated in the parent as well, and never freed.

It's rather hard to free this memory, since it's needed up to the very
moment of the execve().  A partial fix would be for buildargv() to
keep a pointer to the allocated memory in a static variable, and
free() it next time it's called.
