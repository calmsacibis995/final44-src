Subject: fnmatch broken
Index: lib/libc/gen/fnmatch.c net2

From the looks of it the fnmatch function appears to be
broken.  It is supposed to match a string against a pattern
using the shell rules.

I've been working on CVS 1.3 and it is listing all files as
being ignored.  According to the way CVS uses it and the man
page states it, fnmatch should return 0 if the string matches
the pattern according to shell rules and non-zero if there is a
match.  What I have found is that it does exactly the
opposite.  What is the correct behavior?  I can fix the problem
if it should work like the man page says.  But don't want to
mess things up if it should stay the way that it is.

Thanks!
Steve
