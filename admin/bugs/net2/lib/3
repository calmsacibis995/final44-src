Subject: btree package bug

Dear sirs,

I have found a bug in the db (btree) package in the networking release 2.
Using the btree package, I have discovered that large data blocks can
not be retrieved correctly if the size of the data block exactly matches
the size of the space available in the current disk/cache block.

There is a simple fix - line 104 of src/lib/libc/db/btree/big.c should
be amended to read

        if (nhere >= nbytes) {

The absence of the '=' causes the package to read block 0 as if it were
a normal data block and chaos ensues.

If you need any more information about the problem, please feel free to
email me.

Secondly, if you receive queries from anyone trying to port btree to SunOS
4.1.1, one possible problem is that Sun typedef size_t to be 'int' and
not 'unsigned int' as specified by ANSI.

Regards,

Martyn Tovey.
