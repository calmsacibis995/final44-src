Description:
	syscall(2) doesn't work right.  It leaves $sp off by a word,
which can lead to disaster when it's called repeatedly (as it is in
XView3.0).

Release:
	Gamma.4 (0.9.4)

Repeat-By:
	Write a program that has a local variable on the stack;
initialize it, then call syscall() repeatedly.  Note that the value
eventually gets trashed when the stack works its way up over the variable.

Fix:
*** /cdrom/usr/src/lib/libc/i386/sys/syscall.s	Wed Jan  1 16:22:58 1992
--- syscall.s	Sat Jan 23 01:24:01 1993
***************
*** 45,50 ****
--- 45,52 ----
  	pop	%eax	/* syscall number */
  	push	%ecx
  	LCALL(7,0)
+ 	push	%ecx	/* need to push *something* to keep stack frame
+ 			   intact upon return. */
