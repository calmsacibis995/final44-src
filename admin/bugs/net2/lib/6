Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

syscall pops the system call number and does not push anything
back.  This causes the calling function to destroy its local
variables.

fix:
------------------------------------------------------
*** syscall.s.orig	Wed Jan  1 23:22:58 1992
--- syscall.s	Thu Aug 13 22:02:41 1992
***************
*** 45,50 ****
--- 45,51 ----
  	pop	%eax	/* syscall number */
  	push	%ecx
  	LCALL(7,0)
+ 	push	(%esp)
  	jb	1f
  	ret
  1:

NOTE: The patch here is for beta.  One of the bugs was fixed in gamma3,
	the other was not.
