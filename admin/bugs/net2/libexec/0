We've recently had to notify a bunch of sites that had the ftp home directory
owned and writable by ftp and had .rhosts file inserted.  Obviously the BSD 
directions clearly say to make it unwritable by anyone but it's easy to 
misconfigure, and the above points out another way of subverting it.  Any 
thoughts to change your directions to make it owned by root?
