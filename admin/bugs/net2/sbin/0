Subject: bug in net2 dump and newly announced dump.
Index: sbin/dump net2

	Back in 87, someone incorrectly posted a bug report for a non-bug 
	in dump because he had failed to see the presence of "ino++" prior
	 to "getino(ino)"	

	That report subsequently was reposted in ucb-fixes as: 
		V1.28 (dump fails to write highest numbered inode to tape)

	This is not the same thing, although the symptoms are the same as 
	described there,  which is why I point out this distinction.

dumptraverse.c:mapfiles() contains a loop that begins with:

	        for (ino = 0; ino < maxino; ino++) {
	                dp = getino(ino);

This contrasts with the loop in main() containing:

	for (map = dumpdirmap, ino = 0; ino < maxino; ) {
		dirty = GETDIRTY(ino) /* shortened for brevity */
                ino++;
                if ((dirty & 1) == 0)
                        continue;
                dp = getino(ino);
		/* work with dp */		
	}

and the subsequent loop using dumpinomap.

While the loops in main() appear to be correct, the loop in mapfiles()
can never invoke
	SETINO(maxino, usedinomap)
or 
	SETINO(maxino, dumpinomap);

Changing the < to <= in mapfiles() (BUT NOT IN MAIN!!) fixes it.
