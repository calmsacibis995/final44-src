Subject: bug in /usr/src/sbin/ping/ping.c
Index: sbin/ping/ping.c net2

I just found a bug in the ping source that I see is in both the
Net/2 source and the latest source on vangogh.

In the function fill(), when the user specifies a fill pattern with
the -p option, the upper bound is missing "+ sizeof(struct timeval)".
Without this it fills beyond the end of the outpack[] array.  With
the Net/2 sources on a Sparc this nicely wiped out the "options"
variable, but its effect is system-dependent.  It seems to work OK
on BSD/386 and on vangogh.  (When it wiped out the "options" variable,
depending on the pattern I specified, it once turned on the F_FLOOD
bit in the options, bypassing the getuid() check that should normally
be done!  suid-root programs that randomly wipe out memory are a hazard
to our health.)

Here's the line, around line 965:

if (ii > 0) {
     for (kk = 0; kk <= MAXPACKET - (8 + sizeof(struct timeval) + ii); kk += ii)
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              for (jj = 0; jj < ii; ++jj)
              bp[jj + kk] = pat[jj];
}
