Subject: ovbcopy doesn't restore registers
Index: sys net2
Apparently-To: net2-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	ovbcopy in sys/i386/i386/locore.s fails to restore saved registers,
	thus causing the "ret" instruction to return to an invalid location
	(usually causing a fault)

Repeat-By:
	Examine the code.  Here it is.  The lines starting with +
    show my fix.

-----------------------------------
    #
    # ovbcopy (src,dst,cnt)
    # NOTE: does not (yet) work doing words at a time
    #

    .globl  _ovbcopy
_ovbcopy:
    pushl   %esi
    pushl   %edi
    movl    12(%esp),%esi
    movl    16(%esp),%edi
    movl    20(%esp),%ecx
    addl    %ecx,%esi   /* copy from end to beginning */
    addl    %ecx,%edi
    decl    %esi
    decl    %edi
    std         /* decrementing as we go */
    rep
    movsb
    xorl    %eax,%eax
    cld
+   popl    %edi
+   popl    %esi
	ret
-----------------------------------

Fix:
	restore the saved registers before returning.

	diff locore.s locore.s.released
    514,515d513
    <       popl    %edi
    <       popl    %esi
