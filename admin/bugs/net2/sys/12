Subject: tcp_input() chooses incorrect iss when connection in TIME-WAIT state.

Index: sys net2

Description:
	Detailed description of the problem, suggestion, or complaint.

	From RFC-1122, page 88
            When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in
            TIME-WAIT state for a time 2xMSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime).
            However, it MAY accept a new SYN from the remote TCP to
            reopen the connection directly from TIME-WAIT state, if it:

            (1)  assigns its initial sequence number for the new
                 connection to be larger than the largest sequence
                 number it used on the previous connection incarnation,
                 and
	    ...
	
	The code that implements this assigns the initial sequence number
	for the new connection to be larger than the largest sequence
	number _the remote host_  used on the previous connection
	incarnation. i.e. rcv_nxt is used instead of snd_nxt.


	Additional Suggestion.
	This code could be moved to before the segment is trimmed.
	If rsh, for example, is used from a system using 4.2bsd
	derived code the sequence number for the SYN will likely be
	within the receive window of the old connection because
	TCP_ISSINCR is only 128.  This will cause RST's to be sent
	and rcmd(3) to backoff.

Repeat-By:
	Inspection of code.

	Watch network traffic (e.g. tcpdump)
	$ rsh host echo ; rsh host echo
	Where host is 4.3bsd-tahoe, 4.3bsd-reno or BSD-NET2.
