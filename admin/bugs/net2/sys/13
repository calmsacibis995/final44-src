Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

On rare combinations of memory and kernel sizes the system may fault when
allocating the page map structures.  The cause of this is that the estimation
of the number of pages is too low, and the map entry for the additional page
does not fit in the allocated page maps space.  For example if start is
0x10a000 and end is 0x7fe000, the initial estimation is 1755 pages, while
after allocating the required page map space the system finds out there are
1756 pages free.  When attempting to initialize the 1756'th page map entry
the system faults.

The following patch fixes this problem.
