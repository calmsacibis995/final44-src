Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

  Mmap(2) fails to ensure the user does not maps on parts of the kernel
context of the process, allowing programs like 
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/mman.h>
  main(){mmap(0xfdbfe000,8192,PROT_READ,MAP_ANON|MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE,0,0);}
to crash the system with a double fault, and provides a great opportunity
for attaining super user priviliges.
