Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

  Executing msync on systems compiled with -DDEBUG causes a panic.  The
reason is that vm_pager_map_page panics if it receives an active page.
The following patch fix the problem.
