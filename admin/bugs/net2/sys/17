Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

  Munmap(2) fails to ensure the user does not deallocates parts of
the kernel context of the process, allowing programs like 
main(){munmap(0xfdbfe000,8192);} to crash the system with a double
fault.  A similar problem occurs with /dev/vga ioctl VGAIOCUNMAP. 
The following patch fixes the munmap(2) problem.
