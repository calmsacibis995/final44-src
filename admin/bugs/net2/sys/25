Subject: mbuf memory leak fix in BSD 'ip_output.c'
Date: Tue, 18 May 93 09:23:44 -0400
From: "Dennis T. Cook" <bigmax!cook@uunet.UU.NET>

Problem description:

When outgoing IP packets have to be fragmented and no mbufs are
available during the 'm_copy' operation, an mbuf remains allocated.
This shows up via 'netstat -m' as some number of mbufs allocated to
packet headers.

Fix:

In 'ip_output.c', 'm_free' has to be added in the following segment of code:

            mhip->ip_len = htons((u_short) (len + mhlen));
            m->m_next = m_copy(m0, off, len);
            if (m->m_next == 0)
                {
                (void) m_free(m);   <---------- NEW LINE --------------
                error = ENOBUFS;        /* ??? */
                goto sendorfree;
                }
            m->m_pkthdr.len = mhlen + len;
