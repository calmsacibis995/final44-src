Subject: i386 port doesn't service NETISR_ISO (clnlintrq)
Index: sys net2
Apparently-To: net2-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	the module sys/i386/isa/icu.s does not service the ISO input queue.

Repeat-By:
	Just try and receive an ISO packet!! :-)  the driver will queue
	the packet to the clnlintrq but that queue is never serviced.

    simple inspection of the code will also show you there is no
	corresponding code for servicing this queue.

Fix:
	service the queue!!  here is a diff with the correction.
