Subject: m4 eval()

In old Unix m4,

	eval(2^4)

produces

	16

i.e., ^ is the exponentiation operator.  In the new m4,

	eval(2^4)

produces

	6

i.e., ^ is the bitwise exclusive or operator.

I have gotten rid of my dependence on the power operator in my SPARC
libc, but this undocumented difference should probably be resolved,
in this case by making the new m4 do what the old one did.
