Text of bug report

4.3BSD based

1) When running vi on a file which has a line with more characters in it
   than the width of the terminal AND the vi cursor is positioned on a
   character beyond that width AND a control/Z is performed to put vi in
   the background AND vi is then brought to the foreground, THEN the screen
   is not repainted (as would normally happen).

2) After this happens, attempting to use the vi cursor positioning commands
   to move left in the long line causes the following error to print out
   when the attempt is made to cross the terminal width boundary:

   Internal error: vgoto

   vi is then left in open mode.


For example, consider an 80-column terminal and a file with a 90-character
line.  If the cursor is placed between the 79th and 80th characters (the
cursor is on top of the 80th character and is in the rightmost position on
the line) and vi is brought to the background and foreground, then the
screen repaints, the cursor can move, and all is well.  However if the
cursor position is between the 80th and 81st characters (the cursor is
on top of the 81st character and is in the leftmost position on the next
line) and vi is brought to the background and foreground then the screen is
not repainted until some cursor movement occurs.  When that movement DOES
occur, then screen contents are not correct.  If that cursor movement is
to the beginning of the line, then the internal error occurs.

This test was performed using a file of one line containing 90 characters
(no tabs) on an 80-column terminal.  Different terminal types (sun, vt100,
xterm) were tried with the same effect.  Different venders were tried
(Alliant FX/2800 running Concentrix 2.2, Sun 3/50 running SunOS 4.0).
The stty 'columns' value affects the results.  If 'stty columns 79' is
performed before entering vi, then movement from the 80th to 79th character
causes the internal error.

The results of ":set all" in vi produce:
