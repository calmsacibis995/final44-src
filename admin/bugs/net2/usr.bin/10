Ok, I finally got a minute to work on this.

The first problem is that the m4 on vangogh is (was) much newer than
what we had on elf. I ported it to elf and tried giving it two
filenames. This caused a core dump (on both elf and vangogh) which
resulted in the appended patch to m4/main.c which I have tested on elf
and installed on vangogh. (ilevel was becoming negative as the result
of the test.)

This still doesn't fix my original problem; namely, tvtwm fires up m4
with a named temporary file and "-" while stdin aimed at the .twmrc and
stdout aimed at a pipe. Since the new m4 doesn't recognize "-" as
stdin, tvtwm fails.

So the question is do we hack tvtwm to sometimes use /dev/stdin and
sometimes use "-" or do we hack m4 to accept "-" as an alias for
/dev/stdin? I've installed the appended patch on elf to buy some time
while you chose the lesser of the evils...
