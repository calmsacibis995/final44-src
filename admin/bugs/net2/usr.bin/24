Subject: BSD "make" doesn't grok the "include" that other "make"s do
Index: usr.bin net2
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU
Description: 
	The System III "make" added a feature wherein a line of the form

		include <filename>

	in a Makefile, where <filename> is the pathname of a file with
	no special characters around it, causes the file to be included
	into the Makefile at that point.

	The System V "make" continued to support that feature.

	The Sun "SunPro 'make'" picked it up, as it was intended to be a
	superset of the SV "make".

	The GNU "make" picked it up.

	The Sprite/BSD "make" *didn't* pick it up.

	Get with the program, folks....
Repeat-By:
	Try using a Makefile with such an "include" line, and watch the
	BSD "make" barf.
Fix:
