Subject: Source to make assumes 32-bit wide pointers.
Index: 	usr.bin net2
Apparently-To: 4bsd-bugs@BERKELEY.EDU

Description:
	Comparisons are made between 2 different pointer types where its
	internal concept of a nil pointer is one set to all ones. One of the
	pointer types (ListNode) defines its nil to be (ListNode) -1 where
	the other (LstNode) sets it to (LstNode) 0xFFFFFFFF. If your
	pointers are larger than 32 bits wide, these 2 are not equal.

Fix:
	Apply patch to sprite.h:
