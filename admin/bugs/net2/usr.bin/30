Shalom,
  I am working on BSDI's BSD/386, and found several bugs in sections of
the code that are from the Network Release 2.  I heard you might be
interested in those bug reports, so I compiled them all, and put here.
I do not have the time needed for going through all of them, sorting
them and checking if they really appear in the Nework Release 2, so
I just concatenated all those that seem to belong here.  Sorry about that.

NOTE: This bug was found in beta.  Gamma3 code is wrong, but I was not
	able to reproduce the problem...

If the set of directories in which to search expands to more than 1024 chars
man will lose many of the entries.  The _default section usually gets that
long (at least here).

I also recommend changing the man page name from man.conf to man_conf,
or changing the refferrences in the man page of the man command.

fix:
