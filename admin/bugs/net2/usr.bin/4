Description:
	ftp dumps core when you type "get *".
Repeat-By:
	ftp to some site, type valid login & password
	type "get *" by mistake instead of "mget *"
	note core dump from ftp
Comment:
	All the ftp commands I can find, including the one in 4.3net2,
	dump core; it seems to be an old bug.  As near as I can tell,
	not only is ftp trying to expand the "*", it's trying to expand
	it on the *local* machine.
