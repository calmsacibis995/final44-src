Subject: the /etc files are in the wrong place
Index: sys/pdpdist 2.10BSD

Description:
	The files in /etc on the 2.10BSD distribution tape are for kazoo,
	our development machine.  The files in sys/pdpdist are much more
	general and helpful in configuring these files, particularly in
	the use of SLIP, the network in general, and the RAM disk.
Repeat-By:
	By inspection.
Fix:
	Take the relevant files, ESPECIALLY "rc" and "rc.local", from
	/sys/pdpdist and and use them as templates for configuring your
	local machine.
