Subject: Trailers don't work with 2.10BSD
Index: sys 2.10BSD

Description:
	If a machine attempts to talk to a 2.10BSD machine using
	a trailer protocol, 2.10 will crash.
Repeat-By:
	Find a machine that uses trailers, whether or not you tell
	it you can handle them; usually an Ultrix machine.
Fix:
	No fix for the 2.10 system.  Just configure the other machine
	not to run with trailers.
