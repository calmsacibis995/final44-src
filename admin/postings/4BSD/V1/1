	Welcome to comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes.  This is a moderated
newsgroup intended for "official" fixes to the current Berkeley
release.  It will normally include only 4.3BSD fixes, although
4.2BSD fixes will be provided if the bug is of sufficient importance.
2.9BSD and 2.10BSD fixes will remain in comp.bugs.2bsd.
	If at all possible, postings will be diff listings from the
released source, not from intermediate sources.  Postings will be
sequentially numbered and missed postings may be requested from the
moderator.
	Bug reports should not be posted to this newsgroup.  As before,
bug reports should be forwarded to "4bsd-bugs@ucbvax.berkeley.edu", or,
for UUCP sites, to "ucbvax!bugs".  Bugs sent to those addresses will be
posted to this newsgroup when they have been evaluated and fixed.
	Since Berkeley hasn't done anything like this before, we would
appreciate any suggestions from the user community.
