Subject: The 4.4BSD-Lite distribution

Several people have asked if it is the intention of the University of
California and the CSRG to ever make the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution.  To
the best of my knowledge, it is the intention of Kirk, myself and the
University that the distribution be made when the lawsuit is resolved.
The contents of the distribution will, of course, be a function of the
outcome of the lawsuit.  The licensing will be very similar to the
licensing for the NET/2 release.
