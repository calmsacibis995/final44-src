I've been asked a lot lately about the availability of the 4.4BSD Manual
Set and of the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution on CD-ROM.  I'm glad to be able
to say that the USENIX Association and O'Reilly & Associates have pooled
resources to make them available.  Attached are three articles, the
first from the upcoming USENIX ;login publication, the second from an
O'Reilly & Associates net posting, and finally an O'Reilly & Associates
press release.

I'd like to thank the USENIX board members, the USENIX staff, (especially
Ellie Young and Alain Henon), and Tim O'Reilly and his staff for making
this happen.

4.4 BSD Manuals - 
Hot off the Press!

The USENIX Association and O'Reilly & Associates are publishing the
final, definitive release of the Berkeley version of UNIX, which has
been the basis for many commercial UNIX variants. Written by the
Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California,
Berkeley, the complete five volume set includes a CD-ROM and will be
available in early July.  As this newsletter goes to press, we hope that
two volumes (*) will be available at the USENIX Summer Conference in
Boston.

Below is a brief summary of each volume. USENIX members will receive a
special discount and can order these directly from O'Reilly in July.
More information will be forthcoming in the next issue.

4.4BSD User's Reference Manual (URM)* 
898 pp. ISBN 1-56592-075-9, June 1994.

This volume (URM) collects the man pages for the more than 284 user
programs that make up the user portion of the 4.4BSD UNIX release
(section 1 of the traditional UNIX Reference Manual), plus additional
pages for games (section 6 of the traditional manual) and miscellaneous
information (section 7, which includes mostly information on troff macro
packages and other text processing information.) URM is useful even if
you don't use the BSD version of UNIX. Many of the commands are
compatible with the POSIX standard and thus identical to those in other
UNIX versions.  Because 4.4BSD includes many freeware programs that are
available but not documented in other versions of UNIX, you may find
yourself turning first to this book to look up options for programs like
perl, GNU emacs, compress, patch, g++, or kerberos.

4.4BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM) 
646 pp. ISBN 1-56592-080-5, May 1994.

SMM includes man pages for system administration commands (section 8 of
the online reference manual), plus supplementary documents useful to
system administrators.

4.4BSD Programmer's Supplementary
Documents (PSD)606 pp. ISBN 1-56592-079-1, June 1994.

In this volume, you'll find useful papers on such tools as the gdb and
adb debuggers, source code control systems RCS and SCCS, lex and yacc,
and the m4 macro processor.  You'll also find such historical documents
as Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson's classic first paper about UNIX and
Kernighan and Ritchie's classic introduction to UNIX programming.

On a more up to date note, this book also includes a two part tutorial
on interprocess communication (IPC) under 4.4BSD UNIX.

4.4BSD Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM)*
868 pp. ISBN 1-56592-078-3, June 1994.

PRM collects the man pages for the various UNIX  program ming libraries,
plus related information for programmers.  It consists of sections 2
through 5 of the online man page collection:

(2) UNIX System Calls 
(3) C Library Subroutines
(4) Special Files (device interfaces) 
(5) File Formats

4.4BSD User's Supplementary Documents 
(USD) 686 pp. ISBN 1-56592-076-7, June 1994.

This volume, the User's Supplementary Documents, collects papers
relating to miscellaneous "user" tools, principally text editors and
document processors.

software without a pre-existing system that is already installed and 
running.  The 4.4BSD-Lite distribution did not include sources for the 
complete 4.4BSD system.  The source code for a small number of utilities 
and files (including a few from the operating system) were removed so that 
the system could be freely distributed.

       O'REILLY AND USENIX PUBLISH FINAL BERKELEY VERSION OF UNIX 
                  ON CD-ROM AND FIVE-VOLUME DOC SET

SEBASTOPOL, CA -- 4.4BSD is the final release of what may be one of the 
most significant research projects in the history of computing.  When Bell 
Labs originally released UNIX source code to the research and development
community, brilliant researchers wrote their own software and added it to 
UNIX in a spree of creative anarchy that hasn't been equaled since.  The 
Berkeley Software Distribution became the repository of much of that work.

     In those years of creative ferment, source code was widely available,
so programmers could build on the work of others.  As UNIX became 
commercialized, access to source became increasingly curtailed and original 
development more difficult.

     The Computer Systems Research Group of the University of California at
Berkeley, in cooperation with the Usenix Association and O'Reilly &
Associates, Inc, has now published the final, definitive release of the
Berkeley version of UNIX, which has been the basis for many commercial
UNIX variants.  The source code for the system is available on CD-ROM and
is accompanied by a five-volume documentation set.

                 4.4BSD-LITE CD-ROM COMPANION

     With this release of 4.4BSD, one need no longer work at a
university or UNIX system development house to have access to UNIX
source.  The University has prepared a "Lite" release of the operating
system, from which the source code for a small number of utilities
and files, including a few from the operating system, has been removed
so that the system can be freely distributed.  
     
     The source code included on the 4.4BSD-Lite CD-ROM Companion
will provide invaluable information on the design of any modern
UNIX or UNIX-like system, and the source code for the utilities and
support libraries will greatly enhance any programmer's toolkit.
  
     In addition to source code, the CD includes the manual pages, other 
documentation, and research papers from the University of California, 
Berkeley's 4.4BSD-Lite distribution.  (CD Domestic: ISBN 1-56592-081-3 
($40 US); CD International: ISBN 1-56592-092-9.)


                   4.4BSD FIVE-VOLUME DOC SET

     A five-volume doc set is available from O'Reilly directly with or
without CD-ROM. Volumes 1 through 5 plus CD-ROM, ISBN 1-56592-082-1,
costs $150 (US).  Volumes 1 through 5 only, ISBN 1-56592-077-5, costs 
$120 (US).  The doc set includes:
