Subject: V1.28 retraction
Index: etc/dump/dumptraverse.c 4.3BSD

Description:
	The bug fix posted as V1.28, fixing a problem in dumptraverse.c,
	should not be applied to 4.2 or 4.3 BSD, it is incorrect for those
	systems.  Tapes made with the "fixed" dump should be uncorrupted.
	In some cases there will be a garbage inode written on the end of
	the tape which will have a bogus ino = maxino+1.  Since this inode
	never appears in a directory, it will never be extracted.  However,
	restore will report "expected next file xxx, got yyy", where xxx
	is the value of maxino computed by restore from spcl.c_count in
	the clrmap header and yyy is the bogus inode number.  This error is
	non-fatal.  There is more trouble if this garbage inode appears to
	be a directory.  Restore reports "cannot find directory inode yyy",
	where yyy is again the bogus inode number.  This error is fatal.  In
	both cases, restore seems to be otherwise successful because it
	finishes processing all the real inodes before it hits the bogus one.
Fix:
	Back out the changes to dumptraverse.c described in ucb-fixes
	bug report V1.28.
