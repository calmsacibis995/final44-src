Description:
	This is a followup message, to clear up two points.
	First off, a better value to use to PATCH your sendmail
	executable is 0xff; if you're using the patch script,
	change:
		96972?w 0
	to:
		96972?w 65535

	Secondly, note, if, when you run strings(1) on your sendmail
	executable, greping for ``debug'', you don't get any output,
	don't worry about the problem, your system is already (we
	think) safe.
