Subject: new version of sendmail available
Index: usr.lib/sendmail 4.3BSD-tahoe

A new version of sendmail is now available on ucbarpa.berkeley.edu, in
~ftp/4.3/sendmail.tar.Z.  This version fixes all of the security problems
that we are aware of as well as having several minor cleanups.  A faster
and cleaner version of rmail is also provided as well as new, name server
oriented configuration files.  If you have any problems with it, contact me.
