Subject: re-fix for chown security problem
Index: sys/ufs_syscalls.c 4.3BSD-tahoe

Description:
	There's a security problem associated with 4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-tahoe
	systems involving the chown(2) system call.  It may exist in
	4.3BSD derived systems; contact your vendor for more information.

	This is a second attempt at a correct fix; the fix posted on 16
	January 1989 is incorrect.  The attached fix is a diff from the 
	original version, not from the 16 January fix.
Fix:
	Apply the attached patch to sccsid version 7.3 of ufs_syscalls.c.
