Subject: sendmail 5.64 available
Index: sendmail 4.3BSD(-tahoe)

Description:
	Version 5.64 of sendmail is now available by anonymous ftp from
	arpa.berkeley.edu.  The file is named 4.3/sendmail.5.64.tar.Z,
	and is a compressed tar of the sendmail source code.  Version 5.64
	contains several cleanups and two security fixes.  It also
	implements locking using flock(2), not by locking in the file
	system.  This is extremely useful for sites handling large amounts
	of electronic mail.
