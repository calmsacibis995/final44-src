Dear Colleague:

     We are happy to send you information about  our  June,  1990
test  release  of  the  Fourth  Berkeley  Software  Distribution,
4.3BSD-Reno.  This release represents an  intermediate  point  in
the  development of 4.4BSD; several new facilities have been com-
pleted and are ready for external use, while other new facilities
slated  for the 4.4BSD release have not yet been integrated.  Our
goal in making this release available is to get feedback  on  any
problems  in  the design or implementation of the new facilities,
as well as to allow adventurous sites  to  gain  experience  with
these portions of 4.4BSD.

     This distribution is NOT intended to be used  on  production
systems;  nor  is  it intended for sites without sufficient local
expertise to find and fix any problems that are encountered.   It
is  intended to be used to provide an advance look at some of the
facilities and interfaces that we will be distributing in 4.4BSD.
We  are  interested  in getting feedback on the problems that you
find and also any compatibility problems that you  anticipate  in
trying  to convert your applications to run on this release.  The
interfaces in this release will  change  before  the  release  of
4.4BSD (at least in part based on feedback from this test group).
Thus, you should not expect applications ported to  this  release
to work unchanged on 4.4BSD.

     Unlike past test releases, 4.3BSD-Reno is  being  made  gen-
erally  available  to  4.3BSD  licensees,  and 4.3BSD-Reno may be
redistributed and used in released  products  (within  the  usual
licensing  constraints).   However,  you will have to upgrade any
code that you use from 4.3BSD-Reno to the 4.4BSD code within  one
year  of  the release of 4.4BSD.  We appreciate your help in this
debugging effort and look forward to hearing  from  you.   Please
send   your  comments  to  reno43-bugs@okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU.   We
regret that changes documents are not available; the next section
outlines the major changes available in 4.3BSD-Reno.

     The license to 4.3BSD-Reno is  simply  an  Addendum  to  the
4.3BSD  License.   Sites without a 4.3BSD license may obtain both
4.3BSD and 4.3BSD-Reno simultaneously, but  must  sign  a  4.3BSD
license as well as the Addendum.  Contact the distribution office
for 4.3BSD licensing information.  4.3BSD is  available  only  to
sites with UNIX/32V, System  III, or  System  V  source  licenses
with  AT&T.   We  are  actively working to decrease the amount of
AT&T code in the system.  We expect that we will provide a subset
of  4.4BSD  without  the  AT&T code to sites without requiring an
AT&T license.  However, we are not prepared to make that determi-
nation  for this release, so we are providing only tapes with the
complete system at this time.

     The enclosed information is designed to serve two  purposes.
The first purpose is to acquaint you with the details of our dis-
tribution so you can decide whether you would like to receive it.
The second purpose is to tell you how to obtain our distribution.

What is 4.3BSD-Reno?

     The distribution consists of one 6250 bpi or three 1600  bpi
magnetic tapes containing full sources and documentation plus one
set of binaries.  You may specify VAX  and/or  Tahoe  (CCI  Power
6/32) binaries.

     The three major new facilities available in the  4.3BSD-Reno
release  are the addition of ISO/OSI networking support, a freely
redistributable implementation of NFS, and the conversion to  and
addition  of  the  POSIX.1  facilities.  There are numerous other
changes throughout the system.

     The ISO/OSI Networking consists of a  kernel  implementation
of  transport  class 4 (TP-4), connectionless networking protocol
(CLNP), and 802.3-based link-level  support  (hardware-compatible
with Ethernet*).  The session and  presentation  layers  will  be
provided  outside  the  kernel by the ISO development environment
(ISODE).  Included  in  this  development  environment  are  file
transfer  and management (FTAM), virtual terminals (VT), a direc-
tory services implementation  (X.500),  and  miscellaneous  other
utilities.

     A new virtual filesystem interface has  been  added  to  the
kernel to support multiple filesystems.  Although generally simi-
lar to Sun's vnode interface, the  Berkeley  interface  has  been
structured  for  more efficient support of filesystems that main-
tain state (such as the local filesystem).  In  addition  to  the
local ``fast filesystem'', we have added an implementation of the
network filesystem (NFS) that fully interoperates  with  the  NFS
shipped by Sun and its licensees.  Because our NFS implementation
was  implemented  using   only   the   publicly   available   NFS
specification, it does not require a license from Sun to  use  in
source  or binary form.  By default it runs over UDP to be compa-
tible with Sun's implementation.  However, it can  be  configured
on  a per-mount basis to run over TCP.  Using TCP allows it to be
used quickly and efficiently through gateways and over  long-haul
networks.  We have also added a memory-based filesystem that runs
in pageable memory,  which  allows  large  temporary  filesystems
without requiring dedicated physical memory.

     The quota system has been rewritten to support both user and
group  quotas  (simultaneously  if desired).  Quota expiration is
based on time rather than the previous metric of number of logins
over  quota.  This change makes quotas more useful on fileservers
onto which users seldom login.

     The 4.3BSD-Reno distribution contains most of the interfaces
specified  in the POSIX.1 system interface standard.  The biggest
area of change is a new terminal driver.  The terminal driver  is
similar  to the System V terminal driver with the addition of the
necessary extensions to get the functionality  previously  avail-
able  in  the  4.3BSD terminal driver.  4.3BSD-Reno also adds the
POSIX job control interface, which is similar to the  4.3BSD  job
control  interface, but adds a security model that was missing in
the 4.3BSD job control implementation.  Other  additions  include
POSIX  signals, FIFO's, and saved user and group identifiers.  We
have been tracking the POSIX shell  and  utility  work  and  have
included  prototypes of many of the proposed utilities.  Finally,
we have converted about 80% of the libraries and header files  to
be compliant with ANSI C.

     Work has also progressed in several  other  areas.   Several
important  enhancements  have  been added to the TCP/IP protocols
including TCP header prediction and serial line  IP  (SLIP)  with
header  compression.   The  routing  implementation has been com-
pletely rewritten to use a hierarchical routing tree with a  mask
per route to support the arbitrary levels of routing found in the
ISO protocols.  The routing table also stores  and  caches  route
characteristics  to  speed  the  adaptation of the throughput and
congestion avoidance algorithms.

     The Kerberos (version 4) authentication  software  has  been
integrated  into  much  of the system (except NFS) to provide the
first real network authentication on BSD.

     The hardware supported by 4.3BSD-Reno is:

+    VAX (86x0, 78x, 750, 730; MicroVAX II, 3200/3500/3600; 82x0)

+    Tahoe (CCI Power 6/32, 6/32SX; Unisys 7000/xx; Harris  HCX7,
     HCX9)

+    HP 9000/300 series

In addition, kernel support for the Intel i386  and  many  AT-bus
peripherals  has  been  added  recently; contact the distribution
office for a list of supported hardware if necessary.

For this distribution, binaries will be available  for  only  the
VAX  and Tahoe architectures.  The 4.4BSD distribution will prob-
ably be available for all the  above  architectures  as  well  as
several machines based on the MIPS processor.

     The reason that this distribution  is  not  labeled  4.4BSD-
alpha  is  because  it  does not contain several major interfaces
that we plan to have  available  for  that  distribution.   These
include:

+    A  new  virtual  memory  system  using  the  mmap  interface
     described  in  the 4.3BSD architecture document.  The inter-
     face is similar to the interface shipped in several  commer-
     cial versions of UNIX such as SunOS 4.0.

+    Support for ISO Connection-Oriented Network  Service,  X.25,
     TP-0.

+    A new internal  network  layering  (``bstreams'')  combining
     features of the current socket layering and of Streams.

+    Fixes, tuning, fixes, documentation, and fixes.

     This release does include several important structural  ker-
nel  changes.  The most pervasive change is to eliminate the user
structure fields u.u_error, u.u_u_r.r_val1, and u.u_ap by using a
new internal system call convention:
error = (*callp)(proc, args, retval);

We are also reducing the use of other global variables  with  the
intent  to  eventually  eliminate all references to the user area
except for the per-process runtime stack.   Thus,  all  substruc-
tures will eventually be referenced via the proc structure.

     Another major change is the  introduction  of  a  new  sleep
interface:
error = tsleep(wchan, pri|PCATCH, wstring, timeout);

The old sleep interface can be used  only  for  non-interruptible
sleeps.  The tsleep interface can be used at any priority, but is
only interruptible if the PCATCH flag is set.  When  interrupted,
tsleep   returns   EINTR   or   ERESTART;  all  non-local  goto's
(longjmp's) have been eliminated from the kernel.

     Many data structures that were previously  statically  allo-
cated  are  now  allocated dynamically.  These structures include
the mount table, the vnode table, the name cache, and  the  quota
structures.

How to obtain the 4.3BSD-Reno release

     All previous 4.3BSD licensees will be able  to  receive  the
4.3BSD Reno release simply by executing the steps outlined below.
4.2BSD licensees who have not yet  upgraded  to  4.3BSD  will  be
required  to  do so as well as following the steps outlined below
for the Reno distribution.  For further information  on  ordering
the standard 4.3BSD distribution, contact our distribution office
at the address given below.

     Because we are a research and development  organization  and
not  a  commercial  organization,  we  make  our research results
available for a fee which covers only our costs for the distribu-
tion.   We distribute only the whole system and cannot send indi-
vidual pieces of the system.  Because the software is distributed
``As Is'' and is partially derived from licensed material, we are
required to have a formal license arrangement with each organiza-
tion to which we distribute.

     Specifically, we must receive  from  your  organization  the
following material before the distribution can be sent:

+    Two appropriate signed Addenda for the Reno distribution  if
     you  are  a  4.3BSD  licensee.  Add  to that the appropriate
     Addendum to receive the upgrade if you are a  4.2BSD  licen-
     see.  For new licensees, two executed copies of the Berkeley
     License Agreement  (4/86)  with  the  appropriate  Addendum,
     i.e.,  for foreign or US government sites, plus the Addendum
     for the Reno distribution.  We require  two  copies  of  all
     Agreements/Addenda with original signatures, one of which is
     returned to the Licensee.  The name of the  organization  on
     the  Addendum  No.  Three  must  be  the  same as that which
     appears on the Software  Agreement  with  AT&T  (or  Western
     Electric).  The  Addendum No. Three must be signed by a duly
     authorized person who holds a position that is at  the  same
     level  or  a higher level of authority as that which appears
     on the AT&T Software Agreement. Please  have  this  person's
     name  and  title typed in the available space in addition to
     the signature.

+    A check from a U.S. bank for $495.00 U.S. (for a single 6250
     BPI  tape  of  4.3BSD-Reno)  or  $595.00 (for three 1600 BPI
     tapes of  4.3BSD-Reno)  payable  to  ``The  Regents  of  the
     University  of California'' must be received before the dis-
     tribution can be sent.  If you must issue a Purchase  Order,
     please  issue one that is blank-backed.  If this is not pos-
     sible, insert and initialize in the  body  of  the  Purchase
     Order  the  following  clause: ``The terms and conditions of
     this Purchase Order are not accepted by The Regents  of  the
     University  of  California.   The  revised  Berkeley License
     Agreement (4/86) governs.''  For  4.2  licensees  that  have
     updated  to 4.3BSD, substitute ``The terms and conditions of
     this Purchase Order are not accepted by The Regents  of  the
     University  of  California.   The  revised  Berkeley License
     Agreement (6/83) and Addendum Number Three govern.''

+    A completed Site Information Form.  The distribution  itself
     will be sent to the technical contact.  The site information
     is kept confidential and is for our use in identifying sites
     with  specific  configurations.   Please note that we cannot
     ship to post office boxes; therefore, please have the techn-
     ical contact's address supplied without use of a post office
     box.

     A checklist is  included  to  aid  you  in  assembling  this
material.  All the above material must be sent to:

        Distribution Coordinator
        Computer Systems Research Group
        Computer Science Division, EECS
        University of California
        Berkeley, California 94720

Once all these items have been received and are in proper  order,
the  distribution will be sent to the technical address indicated
on the Site Information Form that you provided  when  you  placed
your  order; we cannot provide delivery dates.  Once the material
is assembled and packaged, the distribution is shipped by commer-
cial carrier.  Order of shipment will be based on time of arrival
of the properly completed paperwork.  Because of the differential
in  costs  of  shipping  outside  the  United States, we ask that
organizations beyond the North American continent pay the collect
shipping charges.

     The most expedient way to insure that your full distribution
is  sent as quickly as possible is to include in a single package
the signed appropriate Addenda  (without  modification)  for  the
Reno  distribution  plus any other necessary signed legal papers,
depending on your licensing status, the appropriate  check  prop-
erly made out to ``The Regents of the University of California,''
and a completely filled-out Site Information Form,  and  to  send
this single package to the address noted above.

Large Organizations

     Many large organizations have  multiple  entities  that  act
independently  from  one  another  and are licensed independently
from AT&T.  Others have the parent organization licensed by  AT&T
and  copies of the software distribution sent to each independent
entity. The Berkeley License Agreement must be executed with  the
organization holding the appropriate AT&T Software Agreement.

     If your organization has an AT&T license and chooses not  to
redistribute  internally,  please  contact  us  for a copy of the
letter of authorization to be executed by the parent company.

Special Cases

     University of California Sites.  If you are a  part  of  the
University  of California, and do not already have an AT&T source
license for your CPU, you must use the following  procedure:  ask
Pam  True  (415)  642-6348 at Berkeley Campus Materiel Management
for an application for an additional CPU authorization under  The
Regents of the University of California's Software Agreement with
AT&T.  We will receive the completed  application  from  Materiel
Management.   If  you have previously obtained a Berkeley License
for your CPU or have an AT&T source license for your CPU, you  do
not need to contact the Materiel Management Office.

     In all cases, the following items must be sent to  the  Com-
puter  Systems Research Group: 1) a letter signed by the Director
or Head of Department requesting 4.3BSD-Reno,  stating  that  you
have  read and understood the Berkeley License Agreement and that
your organization will abide by it, 2)  an  IOC  for  $495.00  or
$595.00 (1600 BPI), and 3) a Site Information Form if the contact
information has changed.

     DARPA Sites.  The research on which  the  Berkeley  Software
Distributions  are  based  has  been  sponsored by DARPA (Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency).  Provision has been made  for
prepayment  of  distribution  costs  for  a  few designated DARPA
sites.  In place of the check for $495.00 or $595.00, you  should
include  a  letter from your Program Manager stating that you are
designated as such a site.  However, you  must  comply  with  all
other requirements in applying for the distribution.

A Special Note

     The procedures and  rules  set  out  in  this  document  are
University  and  AT&T  constraints that must be followed in order
for the distribution of software to be  possible.   The  Computer
Systems  Research Group has no control over these constraints and
must reject your application if  material  submitted  is  not  in
order.

If You Have Read Everything and Still Need Help

     If you have questions  about  the  licensing  process  after
reading this letter, you may call the distribution group at (415)
642-7780, write to them at the address above, or contact them via
electronic mail at bsd-dist@Berkeley.EDU or ucbvax!bsd-dist. They
will not be able to answer technical questions.


                         Sincerely yours,

                         Mike Karels
