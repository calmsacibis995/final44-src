Subject: 4.3BSD-Reno contributors

	Much of the software in the Berkeley Software Distribution is
contributed by people and organizations in the user community.  We
gratefully acknowledge these contributions; without their support this
distribution would not be possible.

	As part of the 4.3BSD-Reno distribution, we have continued to
identify portions of the distribution which are freely redistributable
to and by anyone, except as restricted by law.  (As a note to anyone
interested in international redistribution, we have recently obtained
a General License GTDA from the Commerce Department covering the BSD
Networking Release #1.) Source code with the following copyright
notice may be freely redistributed, under the specified conditions,
without further license.
 
    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms are permitted
    provided that: (1) source distributions retain this entire copyright
    notice and comment, and (2) distributions including binaries display
    the following acknowledgement:  ``This product includes software
    developed by the University of California, Berkeley and its
    contributors'' in the documentation or other materials provided with
    the distribution and in all advertising materials mentioning
    features or use of this software.  Neither the name of the University
    nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote
    products derived from this software without specific prior written
    permission.

    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	The following list are people and organizations that have contributed
source code that will be part of the 4.4BSD release.  The first group provided
large subsystems, the second, a specific program or library routine.  Please
report any errors or omissions to ``bigbug@ucbvax.berkeley.edu''.  Also, if
you're interested in contributing software, please contact the CSRG at this
address.
