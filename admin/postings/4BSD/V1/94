Subject: 4.3BSD-Reno, root mounted read-only
Index: 4.3BSD

Description:
        The mini-root in the 4.3BSD-Reno distribution is mounted read-only,
	making it difficult to restore the root file system because restore
	wants to create a symbol table file.

Repeat-By:
        Run "xtr" after booting up the mini-root, as specified in the
	installation document, and notice the "read-only file system"
	error message from restore.
Fix:
        Add the following command to be performed during installation:

        Re-mount the mini-root read-write:
        # mount -u /dev/dk0b /

	This is not a complete fix, as it won't work if the mini-root was
	booted from a driver other than 0.  Another, more complete fix is
	to change the restore command in the "xtr" script to be:

		restore xsf 3 /dev/${tape}0

	instead of:

		restore rsf 3 /dev/${tape}0
