Subject: 4.4BSD Contributed Software

As part of preparation for the final release of 4.4BSD, we are assembling
the user contributed software portions of the release.  If you have
previously contributed a software package for distribution with the 4BSD
releases, or you have a software package that you are willing to
contribute and that you believe would benefit the community of Berkeley
UNIX users, please contact me by email.
