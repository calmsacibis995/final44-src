Subject: Dump/Restore Update
Index: sbin/{dump,restore} 4.4BSD-alpha

Description:
	A new version of dump and restore is now available which fixes
	several major bugs:

	In some instances, the NET/2 dump would fail to include unchanged
	intermediate directories making it difficult to extract files on
	the tape. For example, if /usr/src/sbin/dump/dump.h changed, but
	sbin had not changed, sbin might not be on the tape. The result
	would be that files and directories below sbin, though on the
	tape, could not be restored.

	Restore now fully supports POSIX 1003.2 glob'ing. This has been
	done by replacing the adhoc glob code in restore with use of the
	glob(3) function in the C library.  Note that the C-library glob
	function needed some minor (backward compatible) modifications to
	support restore.  Thus, the modified glob.{c,h,3} is included in
	this distribution. It can either replace the glob in your existing
	C library, or be compiled separately in the restore directory.

	Backward compatible changes have been made to dump and restore to
	support the added features in the 4.4BSD filesystems (including
	32-bit uid/gid, 64-bit file sizes, and file types in directories).

Fix:
	Copies of the new dump/restore package are available by anonymous
	ftp from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:ucb/4bsd/dump.restore.tar.Z, or from
	okeeffe.cs.berkeley.edu:pub/dump.restore.tar.Z.
