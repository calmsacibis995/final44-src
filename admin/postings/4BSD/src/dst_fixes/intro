The next four articles posted to comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes, ARTICLES
#13 through #16, will concern the upcoming DST problem.  They contain:

ARTICLE #13	A minimal fix, hopefully easy to install.  It contains
		fixes for both 4.2 and 4.3 BSD systems.  To install
		this fix, unshar ARTICLE #13 in an empty directory and
		follow the instructions contained in the README file.

ARTICLES #14, #15, #16
		What Berkeley has installed.  To install this fix, create a
		directory containing one other directory; the sub-directory
		should be called "tzone".  Unshar ARTICLES #15 and #16 in
		this sub-directory.  Unshar ARTICLE #14 in the top directory.
		Follow the instructions contained in the README file.

You are reading ARTICLE #13.
