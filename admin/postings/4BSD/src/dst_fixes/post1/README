This is the minimal set of fixes for the 1987 DST problem.  It involves a
change to the C library and a single include file.  The following files
should have been provided:

	README			# the file you're reading
	diff.ctime.c.4.2BSD	# context diff with 4.2BSD for ctime.c
	diff.ctime.c.4.3BSD	# context diff with 4.3BSD for ctime.c
	diff.time.h.4.2BSD	# context diff with 4.2BSD for time.h
	diff.time.h.4.3BSD	# context diff with 4.3BSD for time.h

They should all be present as part of ARTICLE #13, as posted to
comp.bugs.4bsd.ucb-fixes.  Note, ARTICLES #14, #15, and #16 are a
much more comprehensive fix and are completely separate from this
fix.

To install:

Step #1:
	Patch the following source with the indicated files:

	For 4.2BSD systems:
	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/ctime.c		diff.ctime.c.4.2BSD
	/sys/h/time.h				diff.time.h.4.2BSD

	For 4.3BSD systems:
	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/ctime.c		diff.ctime.c.4.3BSD
	/sys/h/time.h				diff.time.h.4.3BSD

Step #2:
	Rebuild and install all of your source.  On 4.2BSD and 4.3BSD
	systems, the simplest way is probably:

	"cd /usr/src/lib/libc;make;make install"
	"cd /usr/src;make;make install"

	If you are unable to do this, rebuild and install the following
	programs.  This list reflects the dependencies for 4.3BSD
	systems, so it may be somewhat incorrect for 4.2BSD sites.
