	These are the actual fixes that Berkeley has installed in response
to the 1987 DST problem.  It's basically the ctime package recently posted
to mod.sources by Robert Elz and Arthur Olsen, with a few minor hacks.
	One change was the removal of tzsetwall(3) and its replacement by
unsetenv(3).  This was because programs which wish to use local clock time
will probably also want any programs they fork off to also use local time.
For completeness, the setenv(3) call was also added.
	Another was the behavior of the localtime(3) call when unable to
find the "correct" time file.  The original source simply defaulted to GMT.
This package attempts to return local time if that's available, then tries
to return the kernel's version of local time and then defaults to GMT.
For a more complete description of its behavior, see the ctime(3) man page.
	Also, the timezone(3) routine is still in place, and will probably
remain for the forseeable future.
	Incidentally, the undocumented routine dysize(3) has been deleted;
you should remove it from all local source, it's not going to come back.
See the include file "tzfile.h" for a macro that does the same thing, only
correctly.

	The following files should have been provided:

	README			# the file you're reading

	ctime.3			# various man pages
	date.1
	getenv.3
	tzfile.5

	diff.Makefile.1		# various Makefile updates
	diff.Makefile.2
	diff.Makefile.3

	ctime.c			# various source files
	getenv.c
	setenv.c
	timezone.c
	tzfile.h

	diff.arpadate.c		# various diff files
	diff.date.c
	diff.kern_time.c
	diff.lock.c
	diff.main.c
	diff.time.h

	tzone			# the timezone directory containing:
	Makefile, README, Theory, asia, australasia, etcetera,
	europe, ialloc.c, northamerica, pacificnew, scheck.c,
	solar87, systemv, zdump.8, zdump.c, zic.8, zic.c

To install:

Step #1:
	Install the new man pages in the indicated directories.

	date.1			/usr/man/man1/date.1
	ctime.3			/usr/man/man3/ctime.3
	getenv.3		/usr/man/man3/getenv.3
	tzfile.5		/usr/man/man5/tzfile.5

Step #2:
	Patch the following source with the indicated files:

	/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/Makefile			diff.Makefile.1
	/usr/src/etc/Makefile				diff.Makefile.2
	/usr/src/include/Makefile			diff.Makefile.3
	/sys/sys/kern_time.c				diff.kern_time.c
	/usr/src/include/time.h				diff.time.h
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/src/arpadate.c	diff.arpadate.c
	/usr/src/usr.lib/sendmail/src/main.c		diff.main.c
	/usr/src/ucb/lock.c				diff.lock.c
	/usr/src/bin/date.c				diff.date.c

	Add the following files to the appropriate directories,
	overwriting the current file if necessary.

	getenv.c		/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/getenv.c
	setenv.c		/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/setenv.c
	ctime.c			/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/ctime.c
	timezone.c		/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/timezone.c
	tzfile.h		/usr/src/include/tzfile.h

Step #3:
	Install the new include files; you should be able to go
	to /usr/src/include and do a "make install".  If you can't,
	just get "time.h" and "tzfile.h" into place in /usr/include.

Step #4:
	Make and install the C library; you should be able to go to
	/usr/src/lib/libc and do a "make depend;make;make install".
	If you can't, fix it so you can.  There's a minor gap here,
	too; any programs compiled after step #5 and before step #6
	is complete may think the date is slightly wrong.

Step #5:
	Make and install the timezone files.  First copy the timezone
	directory into /usr/src/etc/tzone, you should be able to just
	do a "cp -r tzone /usr/src/etc/tzone".  Then, edit
	/usr/src/etc/tzone/Makefile and set LOCALTIME.

	If you're EST, "LOCALTIME=US/Eastern"
	If you're CST, "LOCALTIME=US/Central"
	If you're MST, "LOCALTIME=US/Mountain"
	If you're PST, "LOCALTIME=US/Pacific"

	Everybody else, go through the README and figure out what is
	correct.  You should then be able to do a "make; make install".
	This will execute the program "zic" which installs the timezone
	files in /etc/zoneinfo.  Check /etc/zoneinfo to make sure
	everything got put in place.

	For general information, the file "tzone/Theory" is of interest,
	but not precisely accurate in terms of the current package.  It
	is the original file as posted by Olsen and Elz and has not been
	updated to reflect the Berkeley usage.

Step #6:
	Recompile and install the necessary programs.  If your system
	hasn't been changed much, you should be able to just do a
	"make;make install" in /usr/src.  Otherwise, the following
	programs should be recompiled and installed.
