	The purpose of this library is to simulate the new, flexible
length directory names on top of the V7 style directory format, as well
as to provide compatibility routines for systems that do not intend to
convert to the new directory format.
	These are copies of Kirk Mckusick's original routines, with the
addition of scandir(3), a major fix to readdir(3) and minor hacks.  We
have also added a define for the V7 directory structure, "struct v7direct"
so that both the old and new directory structures can coexist.  You can
replace your current system "dir.h" with "ndir.h", if you want to,
as long as you change every instance of "struct direct" in your current
system to "struct v7direct".  This is a pain, but desirable if you want
the directory reading routines to be a part of your standard library and
not require special effort to access.
	There are a couple of fairly interesting situations you can get
into with this package; if you are having difficulties, check to make
sure you're using the correct "dir.h" include file and that you're using
the "DIRSIZ" macro correctly, since it changed in meaning in the new file
system.  The simplest way to deal with the "DIRSIZ" problem is to change
every occurrence in your system to "MAXNAMLEN"; this is compatible with
4.3BSD.
	This package also requires that you have an entry of the form
"typedef long	u_long;" in your sys/types.h file.
	In any case, if you have problems using or installing this
package, contact me.
	Oh, yes, "bug.c" demonstrates the bug in the old readdir(3)
routine.
