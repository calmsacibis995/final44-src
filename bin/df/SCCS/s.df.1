Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
D 16
The recognized types are:
D 15
ufs, nfs, mfs, lfs, pc, fdesc, portal and kernfs,
E 15
I 15
ufs, nfs, mfs, lfs, msdos, fdesc, portal, kernfs, procfs, afs and isofs.
E 15
along with the aggregates:
all (the default),
D 15
local (ufs, mfs, lfs),
and misc (fdesc, portal, kernfs).
E 15
I 15
local (ufs, mfs, lfs, msdos, isofs),
and misc (fdesc, portal, kernfs, procfs).
E 15
The string ``no'' may be prepending to a type to get its complement
(e.g. ``nonfs'' to get non-NFS filesystems).  The first
.Fl t
option overrides the default, additional such options will add to
(or subtract from) the current set of types; e.g. either
``df -t ufs -t lfs''
or
``df -t local -t nomfs''
will display statistics for UFS and LFS filesystems.
E 16
I 16
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.
For example, the
.Nm df
command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
df -t nonfs,mfs
.Ed
.Pp
lists all filesystems except those of type
.Tn NFS
and
.Tn MFS .
The
.Xr sysctl 8
command can be used to find out the types of filesystems
that are available on the system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl vfs
