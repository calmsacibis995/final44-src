.SH DESCRIPTION
For each directory argument,
.I ls
lists the contents of the directory;
for each file argument,
.I ls
repeats its name and any other information requested.
D 2
The output is sorted alphabetically by default.
E 2
I 2
By default, the output is sorted alphabetically.
E 2
When no argument is given, the current directory is listed.
When several arguments are given,
the arguments are first sorted appropriately,
D 2
but file arguments appear
E 2
I 2
but file arguments are processed
E 2
before directories and their contents.
.PP
D 2
There are three major listing formats.
The format chosen depends on whether the output is going
to a teletype, and may also be controlled by option flags.
The default format for a teletype is to list the contents of directories
in multi-column format, with the entries sorted down the columns.
(Files which are not the contents of a directory being interpreted
are always sorted across the page rather than down the page in columns.
This is because the individual file names may be arbitrarily long.)
If the standard output is not a teletype, the default format is to
list one entry per line.
Finally, there is a stream output format in which files are listed
across the page, separated by `,' characters.
The
.B \-m
flag enables this format;
when invoked as
.I l
this format is also used.
.PP
There are an unbelievable number of options:
E 2

There are a large number of options:

E 2
List in long format, giving mode, number of links, owner,
size in bytes, and time of last modification
for each file.
(See below.)
If the file is a special file the size field will instead contain
the major and minor device numbers.
I 2
If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of
the linked-to file is printed preceded by ``\->''.
E 12
I 12

.Sh DESCRIPTION
For each operand that names a
.Ar file
of a type other than
directory,
.Nm ls
displays its name as well as any requested,
associated information.
For each operand that names a
.Ar file
of type directory,
.Nm ls
displays the names of files contained
within that directory, as well as any requested, associated
information.
.Pp
If no operands are given, the contents of the current
directory are displayed.
If more than one operand is given,
non-directory operands are displayed first; directory
and non-directory operands are sorted separately and in
lexicographical order.

The following options are available:

which are interpreted
as follows:
the first character is
.TP 3
D 2
.B  d
E 2

if the entry is a directory;

The next 9 characters are interpreted
as three sets of three bits each.
The first set refers to owner permissions;
D 6
the next to permissions to others in the same user-group;
E 6
I 6
the next refers to permissions to others in the same user-group;
E 6
and the last to all others.
Within each set the three characters indicate
permission respectively to read, to write, or to
execute the file as a program.
For a directory, `execute' permission is interpreted
D 2
to mean permission to search the directory
for a specified file.
E 2
I 2
to mean permission to search the directory.
E 2
The permissions are indicated as follows:
.TP 3
.B  r
if the file is readable;
.br
.ns
.TP 3
.B  w
if the file is writable;
.br
.ns
.TP 3
.B  x
if the file is executable;
.br
.ns
.TP 3
.B  \-
if the indicated permission is not granted.

The group-execute permission character is given
as
.B s
D 2
if the file has set-group-ID mode;
E 2
I 2
if the file has the set-group-id bit set;
E 2
likewise the user-execute permission character is given
as

D 2
if the file has set-user-ID mode.
E 2
I 2
if the file has the set-user-id bit set.
E 7

The group-execute permission character is given as \fBs\fP if the file has
the set-group-id bit set; likewise the user-execute permission character is

as \fBS\fP (capitalized) if the corresponding execute permission is NOT
set.
E 7

The option setting based on whether the output is a teletype is
undesirable as ``ls\ \-s'' is much different than ``ls\ \-s\ |\ lpr''.

almost certain losers.

If the

E 24
I 24
number of links, owner name, group name,
E 24
number of bytes in the file, abbreviated
month, day-of-month file was last modified,
hour file last modified, minute file last
modified, and the pathname.
I 23
In addition, for each directory whose contents are displayed, the total
number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is displayed
on a line by itself immediately before the information for the files in the
directory.

the numeric ID's are displayed.

the major and minor device numbers for the file are displayed
in the size field. If the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the

D 30
the entry type, owner permissions, and group permissions.
E 30
I 30
entry type, owner permissions, and group permissions.
