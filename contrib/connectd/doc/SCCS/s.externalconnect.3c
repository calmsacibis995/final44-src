.SH NAME
externalconnect \- initiate a connection to an external system or service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <phonenumber.h>
#include <connect.h>
.PP
.ft B
externalconnect(towhere, options, optslen)
struct connectdomain *towhere;
char *options;
int optlen;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Connect to an external system or service at an address specified by
.I towhere
using the options specified in
.I options,
which is of length
.I optlen.
.PP
The parameter
.I towhere
does not necessarily need to specify a complete final addres,
as in the case where
an outside modem of a specific type is requested and no dialing is
going to be done and all that is required is
just that a line
and a modem be allocated and prepared for use per options.
.PP
The parameter
.I options
points to a value-result buffer area where options are passed to the connector
program and optionally returned from the connectd(8C) daemon. The buffer should
be large enough to contain all expected string options that may be returned.
Options within this buffer are a sequence of null-terminated strings,
ending with the null string itself.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
This call if successful returns a file descriptor to a serial port or other
entity that
has been connected per the above parameters,
otherwise a \-1 is returned, and a more specific error
code is stored in \fIerrno\fP.
.SH "ERRORS
The call fails if:
.TP 20
[EADDRNOTAVAIL]
The specified address is not available on this machine.
.TP 20
[EAFNOSUPPORT]
Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.
.TP 20
[ETIMEDOUT]
Connection establishment timed out without establishing a connection.
.TP 20
[ECONNREFUSED]
The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.
