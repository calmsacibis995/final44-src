After the data declarations were moved into seperate include files
the sources refused to compile on a pdp-11.  Apparently, the pdp-11
preprocessor can only handle a limited number of include files.
To create a version on a pdp machine, you will probably have to
combine the include files into one include file per source file in
order to get it to compile.  Not all source files may need this extra
bit of work.  You'll just have to try and compile and fix those that
the compiler complains about.  I no longer have access to a pdp-11
machine, so I can't do any testing on it.  (As stated in the README
file, I have run this game on a pdp-11/70 before the include files
were created.)
