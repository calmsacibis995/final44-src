I'm also including a patch to curses that is necesary for nvi under hpux
if you are running an xterm, there is no problem with a vt100 or vt102.
It's very strange and looks to me like hp's libtermlib is doing something
nonstandard, but then, I don't know the curses code at all.  What happens
is that when you scroll, __tscroll() gets a %pN (where N seems to always
be 1) in cap whereas on ultrix & sunos there is no %pN entry.  The bsd
termcap has no idea what to do with this so it barfs (leaves OOPS turds
all over the place).  Anyway, my hack just ignores the %pN and things work
just fine.
