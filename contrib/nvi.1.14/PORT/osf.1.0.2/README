This directory is for OSF/1 reference systems as distributed by OSF.
Currently, this means:
	OSF/1 1.2	(pmax, i386/i486)
	OSF/1 1.3	(i386/i486)
This also works on HP OSF/1 1.0.2 for the PA-RISC.

Those version numbers do not have any correspondence to versions of
OSF/1 shipped for the DEC Alpha.  Nvi has not yet been ported to the
Alpha.  A precursor to that work would be to port the new versions
of "db" and "curses" to a 64-bit architecture.
