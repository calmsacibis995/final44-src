#	@(#)README	8.60 (Berkeley) 4/20/94

This is the README for version 1.14 of nex/nvi, a freely redistributable
replacement for the Berkeley ex and vi text editors.  The compressed tar
archive, for this and future versions, can be retrieved by anonymous ftp
from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu, from the file ucb/4bsd/nvi.tar.Z.  There is a
gzip'd tar archive, nvi.tar.gz, in the same directory.

If you have any questions about nvi, or problems making it work, please
contact me by electronic mail at one of the following addresses:

	uunet!bostic
	bostic@cs.berkeley.edu

o Credit where it's due:

	This software was originally derived from software contributed
	to the University of California, Berkeley by Steve Kirkendall,
	the author of the vi clone elvis.  Without his work, this work
	would have been far more difficult.

	POSIX 1003.2 style regular expression support is courtesy of
	Henry Spencer, for which I am *very* grateful.

	The curses library was originally done by Ken Arnold.  Scrolling
	and general reworking for 4.4BSD was done by Elan Amir.

o From the original vi acknowledgements, by William Joy and Mark Horton:

	Bruce Englar encouraged the early development of this display
	editor.  Peter Kessler helped bring sanity to version 2's
	command layout.  Bill Joy wrote versions 1 and 2.0 through 2.7,
	and created the framework that users see in the present editor.
	Mark Horton added macros and other features and made the editor
	work on a large number of terminals and Unix systems.

o And...
	The financial support of UUNET Communications Services is gratefully
	acknowledged.

o Status:

This software is in beta test, and it's believed to be pretty stable.
Almost all of the historic functionality in ex/vi is there, the missing
pieces are fairly obscure.  In particular, the hardtabs, lisp, optimize,
redraw, and slowopen options are recognized, but not implemented.

Nvi is mostly 8-bit clean.  This isn't difficult to fix, and was left in
during initial development to make things easier.  Wide character support
will be integrated at the same time it is made fully 8-bit clean.

There aren't a lot of new features in nex/nvi, but there are a few things
you might like.  See the "ADDITIONAL FEATURES" section of the reference
page (docs/vi.ref.txt, docs/vi.ref.ps) for a list.

o Porting information:

The directory PORT has directories per OS/machine combination, with
V7-style Makefiles which build nex/nvi.  See the file PORT/README for
detailed information.

o Bug reports:

Code fixes are appreciated, of course, but if you can't provide them,
please email me as much information as you can as to how to reproduce
the bug, and I'll try to fix it locally.  In particular, the screen
routines are nasty stuff, and you probably don't want to mess with them.
Stack traces of core dumps are sometimes helpful, but an example file
with a set of keystrokes that causes the problem is far better.

Please include the following in the bug report;

	o The version of nvi you're running (use :version to get it).
	o The dimensions of the screen (80 x 32).
	o Unless you're confident that they're not a problem, your
	  startup files (.exrc, .nexrc) and the environment variable
	  (EXININT, NEXINIT) values.  (Cutting and pasting the output
	  of ":set all" is usually sufficient.)

o Layout:

nvi:
	Source files for pieces of code that are shared by all the
	editors, like searching and logging code or code translating
	line numbers into requests to the dbopen(3) database code.
	It also has the code for adding, deleting, and changing "records"
	in the underlying database.

nvi/PORT:
	Porting directories, one per OS/architecture combination.  See
	nvi/PORT/README for porting information.

	curses/		-- 4.4BSD curses implementation
	db/		-- 4.4BSD DB routines.
	regex/		-- Henry Spencer's POSIX.2 RE support.

nvi/USD.doc:
	Ex/vi documentation, both historic and current.

	edit/		Roff source for "Edit: A tutorial", USD:14 in the
			4.3BSD manuals.
	ex/		Roff source for "Ex Reference Manual -- Version
			3.7", USD:16 in the 4.3BSD manuals.
	vi/		Roff source for "An Introduction to Display
			Editing with Vi", USD:15 in the 4.3BSD manuals.
			Includes the "Vi Quick Reference" card.
	vi.man/		Manual page for nex/nvi.
	vi.ref/		Reference document for nex/nvi.

nvi/docs:
	Random nvi documentation:

	README		-- Nvi main README file.
	bugs.current	-- Known bugs in the current nvi implementation.
	changelog	-- Log of changes from version to version.
	features	-- Todo list, suggested features list.
	internals/
	    autowrite	-- Vi autowrite option discussion.
	    gdb.script	-- GDB debugging scripts.
	    input	-- Vi maps, executable buffers, and input discussion.
	    quoting	-- Vi quoting discussion.
	    structures	-- Nvi internal structure description.
	spell.ok	-- Misspellings list for README, vi.1.
	tutorial/	-- Historic vi tutorial

nvi/ex:
	The nvi/ex directory is the ex source code.  Because vi has the
	colon command, lots of this code is used by vi.  Generally, if
	functionality is shared by both ex and vi, it's in nvi/ex, if
	it's vi only, it's in nvi/vi.  Files are generally named by the
	command(s) they support, but occasionally with a name that
	describes their functionality.

nvi/sex:
	The nvi/sex directory is the screen support for the ex editor.

nvi/svi:
	The nvi/svi directory is the screen support for a curses based
	vi editor.

nvi/vi:
	The nvi/vi directory is the vi source code.

nvi/xaw:
	Place reserved for an X11 (Athena Widget) screen.
