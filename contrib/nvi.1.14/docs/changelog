1.12 -> 1.14: Mon Apr 18 11:05:10 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION, 4.4BSD)
	+ Fix FILE structure leakage in the ex filter code.
	+ Rework suspend code for System V curses.  Nvi has to do the
	  the work, there's no way to get curses to do it right.
	+ Revert SunOS 4.1.X ports to the distributed curses.  There's
	  a bug in Sun's implementation that we can't live with.
	+ Quit immediately if row/column values are unreasonable.
	+ Fix the function keys to match vi historic behavior.
	+ Replace the echo/awk magic in the Makefile's with awk scripts.
1.11 -> 1.12: Thu Apr 14 11:10:19 1994
	+ Fix bug where only the first vi key was checked for validity.
	+ Make 'R' continue to overwrite after a <carriage-return>.
	+ Only display the "no recovery" message once.
	+ Rework line backup code to restore the line to its previous
	  condition.
	+ Don't permit :q in a .exrc file or EXINIT variable.
	+ Fix wrapscan option bug where forward searches become backward
	  searches and do cursor correction accordingly.
	+ Change "dd" to move the cursor to the first non-blank on the line.
	+ Delete cursor attraction to the first non-blank, change non-blank
	  motions to set the most attractive cursor position instead.
	+ Fix 'r' substitute option to set the RE to the last RE, not the
	  last substitute RE.
	+ Fix 'c' and 'g' substitute options to always toggle, and fix
	  edcompatible option to not reset them.
	+ Display ex error messages in inverse video.
	+ Fix errorbells option to match historic practice.
	+ Delete fixed character display table in favor of table built based
	  on the current locale.
	+ Add ":set octal" option, that displays unknown characters as octal
	  values instead of the default hexadecimal.
	+ Make all command and text input modes interruptible.
	+ Fix ex input mode to display error messages immediately, instead
	  of waiting for the lines to be resolved.
	+ Fix bug where vi calling append could overwrite the command.
	+ Fix off-by-one in the ex print routine tab code.
	+ Fix incorrect ^D test in vi text input routines.
	+ Add autoindent support for ex text insert routines.
	+ Add System V substitute command replacement pattern semantics,
	  where '%' means the last replacement pattern.
	+ Fix bug that \ didn't escape newlines in ex commands.
	+ Regularize the names of special characters to CH_*.
	+ Change hex insert character from ^Vx<hex_char> to ^X<hex_char>
	+ Integrate System V style curses, so SunOS and Solaris ports can
	  use the native curses implementation.
1.10 -> 1.11: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION)
	+ Change H, M, and L to set the absolute mark, historical practice.
	+ Fix bug in stepping through multiple tags files.
	+ Add "remapmax" option that turns off map counts so you can remap
	  infinitely.  If it's off, term_key() can be interrupted from the
	  keyboard, which will cause the buffers to flush.  I also dropped
	  the default max number of remaps to 50.  (Only Dave Hitz's TM
	  macros and maze appear to go over that limit.)
	+ Change :mkexrc to not dump w{300,1200,9600}, lisp options.
	+ Fix backward search within a line bug.
	+ Change all the includes of "pathnames.h" to use <>'s so that the
	  PORT versions can use -I. to replace it with their own versions.
	+ Make reads and writes interruptible.  Rework code that enters and
	  leaves ex for '!' and filter commands, rework all interrupt and
	  timer code.
	+ Fix core dump when user displayed option in .exrc file.
	+ Fix bug where writing empty files didn't update the saved 
	  modification time.
	+ Fix bug where /pattern/ addressing was always a backward search.
	+ Fix bug triggered by autoindent of more than 32 characters, where
	  nvi wasn't checking the right TEXT length.
	+ Fix bug where joining only empty lines caused a core dump.
1.09 -> 1.10: Sat Mar 19 15:40:29 EST 1994
	+ Fix "set all" core dump.
1.08 -> 1.09: Sat Mar 19 10:11:14 EST 1994
	+ If the tag's file path is relative, and it doesn't exist, check
	  relative to the tag file location.
	+ Fix ~ command to free temporary buffer on error return.
	+ Create vi.ref, a first cut at a reference document for vi.
	  The manual page and the reference document only document the
	  set options, so far.
	+ Fix 1G bug not always going to the first non-blank.
	+ Upgrade PORT/regex to release alpha3.4, from Henry Spencer.
	+ Add MKS vi's "cdpath" option, supporting a cd search path.
	+ Handle if search as a motion was discarded, i.e. "d/<erase>".
	+ Change nvi to not create multiple recovery files if modifying
	  a recovered file.
	+ Decide to ignore that the cursor is before the '$' when inserting
	  in list mode.  It's too hard to fix.
1.07 -> 1.08: Wed Mar 16 07:37:36 EST 1994
	+ Leftright and big line scrolling fixes.  This meant more changes
	  to the screen display code, so there may be new problems.
	+ Don't permit search-style addresses until a file has been read.
	+ "c[Ww]" command incorrectly handled the "in whitespace" case.
	+ Fix key space allocation bug triggered by cut/paste under SunOS.
	+ Ex move command got the final cursor position wrong.
	+ Delete "optimize option not implemented" message.
	+ Make the literal-next character turn off mapping for the next
	  character in text input mode.
1.06 -> 1.07: Mon Mar 14 11:10:33 EST 1994
	+ The "wire down" change in 1.05 broke ex command parsing, there
	  wasn't a corresponding change to handle multiple K_VLNEXT chars.
	+ Fix final position for vi's 't' command.
1.05 -> 1.06: Sun Mar 13 16:12:52 EST 1994
	+ Wire down ^D, ^H, ^W, and ^V, regardless of the user's termios
	  values.
	+ Add ^D as the ex scroll command.
	+ Support ^Q as a literal-next character.
	+ Rework abbreviations to be delimited by any !inword() character.
	+ Add options description to the manual page.
	+ Minor screen cache fix for svi_get.c.
	+ Rework beautify option support to match historical practice.
	+ Exit immediately if not reading from a tty and a command fails.
	+ Default the SunOS 4.* ports to the distributed curses, not SMI's.
1.04 -> 1.05: Thu Mar 24 16:07:45 EST 1994
	+ Make cursor keys work in input mode.
	+ Rework screen column code in vi curses screen.  MAJOR CHANGE --
	  after this, we'll be debugging curses screen presentation from
	  scratch.
	+ Explode include files in vi.h into the source files.
1.03 -> 1.04: Sun Mar  6 14:14:16 EST 1994
	+ Make the ex move command keep the marks on the moved lines.
	+ Change resize semantics so you can set the screen size to a
	  specific value.  A couple of screen fixes for the resize code.
	+ Fixes for foreground/background due to SIGWINCH.
	+ Complete rework of all of vi's cursor movements.  The underlying
	  assumption in the old code was that the starting cursor position
	  was part of the range of lines cut or deleted.  The command
	  "d[[" is an example where this isn't true.  Change it so that all
	  motion component commands set the final cursor position separately
	  from the range, as it can't be done correctly later.  This is a
	  MAJOR CHANGE -- after this change, we'll be debugging the cursor
	  positioning from scratch.
	+ Rewrite the B, b, E, e commands to use vi's getc() interface
	  instead of rolling their own.
	+ Add a second MARK structure, LMARK, which is the larger mark
	  needed by the logging and mark queue code.  Everything else uses
	  the reworked MARK structure, which is simply a line/column pair.
	+ Rework cut/delete to not expect 1-past-the-end in the range, but
	  to act on text to the end of the range, inclusive.
	+ Sync on write's, to force NFS to flush.
1.01 -> 1.03: Sun Jan 23 17:50:35 EST 1994 (PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION)
	+ Tag stack fixes, was returning to the tag, not the position from
	  which the user tagged.
	+ Only use from the cursor to the end of the word in cursor word
	  searches and tags.  (Matches historical vi behavior.)
	+ Fix delete-last-line bug when line number option set.
	+ Fix usage line for :split command.
	+ If O_NUMBER set, long input lines would eventually fail, the column
	  count for the second screen of long lines wasn't set correctly.
	+ Fix for [[ reaching SOF with a column longer than the first line.
	+ Fix for multiple error messages if no screen displayed.
	+ Fix :read to set alternate file name as in historical practice.
	+ Fix cut to rotate the numeric buffers if line mode flag set.
1.00 -> 1.01: Wed Jan 12 13:37:18 EST 1994
	+ Don't put cut items into numeric buffers if cutting less than
	  parts of two lines.
0.94 -> 1.00: Mon Jan 10 02:27:27 EST 1994
	+ Read-ahead not there; BSD tty driver problem, SunOS curses
	  problem.
	+ Global command could error if it deleted the last line of
	  the file.
	+ Change '.' to only apply to the 'u' if entered immediately
	  after the 'u' command.  "1pu.u.u. is still broken, but I
	  expect that it's going to be sacrificed for multiple undo.
	+ If backward motion on a command, now move to the point; get
	  yank cursor positioning correct.
	+ Rework cut buffers to match historic practice -- yank/delete
	  numeric buffers redone sensibly, ignoring historic practice.
0.92 -> 0.93: Mon Dec 20 19:52:14 EST 1993
	+ Christos Zoulas reimplemented the script windows using pty's,
	  which means that they now work reasonably.   The down side of
	  this is that almost all ports other than 4.4BSD need to include
	  two new files, login_tty.c and pty.c from the PORT/clib directory.
	  I've added them to the Makefiles.
	+ All calloc/malloc/realloc functions now cast their pointers, for
	  SunOS -- there should be far fewer warning messages, during the
	  build.  The remaining messages are where CHAR_T's meet char *'s,
	  i.e. where 8-bit clean meets strcmp.
	+ The user's argument list handling has been reworked so that there
	  is always a single consistent position for use by :next, :prev and
	  :rewind.
	+ All of the historical options are now at least accepted, although
	  not all of them are implemented.   (Edcompatible, hardtabs, lisp,
	  optimize, redraw, and slowopen aren't implemented.)
	+ The RE's have been reworked so that matches of length 0 are handled
	  in the same way as vi used to handle them.
	+ Several more mapping fixes and ex parser addressing fixes.
