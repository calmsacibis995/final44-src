.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Arithmetic
D 2
types out simple arithmetic problems,
and waits for an answer to be typed in.
If the answer is correct,
it types back \*(lqRight!\*(rq,
and a new problem.
If the answer is wrong,
it replies \*(lqWhat?\*(rq,

If the answer is correct, it types back \*(lqRight!\*(rq, and a new problem.
If the answer is wrong, it replies \*(lqWhat?\*(rq,
E 2
and waits for another answer.

Every twenty problems, it publishes

I 2
statistics on correctness and the time required to answer.
E 5
I 5
asks you to solve problems in simple arithmetic.
Each question must be answered correctly before going on to the next.
After every 20 problems, it prints the score so far and the time taken.
You can quit at any time by typing the interrupt or end-of-file character.

One or more characters can be given;
if more than one is given, the different types of
problems will be mixed in random order; default is

is a decimal number;
all addends, subtrahends, differences, multiplicands, divisors,
and quotients will be less than or equal to the value of

The options are as follows:
.TP
\-o
By default,
.I arithmetic
asks questions on addition of numbers from 0 to 10, and corresponding
subtraction.
By supplying one or more of the characters
.BR +\-x/ ,
you can ask for problems in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division, respectively.
If you give one of these characters more than once, that kind of problem
will be asked correspondingly more often.
.TP
\-r
If a
.I range
is supplied,
.I arithmetic
selects the numbers in its problems in the following way.
For addition and multiplication, the numbers to be added or multiplied
are between 0 and
.IR range ,
inclusive.
For subtraction and division, both the required result and the number to
divide by or subtract will be between 0 and
E 5
.IR range .
D 5
Default
E 5
I 5
(Of course,
.I arithmetic
will not ask you to divide by 0.)  The default
E 5
.I range
is 10.
.PP
D 5
At the start, all numbers less than or equal to
.I range
D 2
are equally likely
to appear.
E 2
I 2
are equally likely to appear.
E 2
If the respondent makes a mistake,
the numbers in the problem which was missed
become more likely to reappear.
E 5
I 5
When you get a problem wrong,
.I arithmetic
will remember the numbers involved, and will tend to select those numbers
more often than others, in problems of the same sort.
Eventually it will forgive and forget.

``Please type a number.'' if arithmetic doesn't understand what you typed.
