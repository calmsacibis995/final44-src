    "fect until you quit the program, even if you play more than one game,",
    "since the program keeps a running score.\n",
    "    The program will prompt for a move in one of two ways.  If the",

    "typed out.  The player can now do one of several things.  He can dou-",
    "ble by typing a 'd', he can roll by typing a space (' ') or newline,",
    "or if he is not sure, he can reprint the board by typing a 'r'.\n",

    "be entered as 13-8.  The second form is <s>/<r> where <s> is the",
    "starting position, an <r> is the roll actually made.  Hence, white",
