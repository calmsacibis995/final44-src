When any of the lines
have the values six or nine,
they are moving lines;
for each
there is an appended
judgement which
becomes significant.
Furthermore, the moving lines
are inherently unstable and
change into their opposites;
a second hexagram
(and thus an additional judgement)
is formed.

Normally, one consults the oracle
by fixing the desired question
firmly in mind
and then casting a set of changes

using yarrow\-stalks

The resulting hexagram

For those who wish
to remain steadfast
in the old traditions,
the oracle will also accept
the results of a personal
divination using,
for example,
coins.
To do this,
cast the change

resulting line values
as an argument.
