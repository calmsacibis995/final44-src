\fIDm\fP is a program used to regulate game playing.  \fIDm\fP expects to
be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to play.  This is
done by creating symbolic links to \fIdm\fP, in \fI/usr/games\fP, for all
D 2
of the regulated games.  The actual binaries for these games are located
in a ``hidden'' directory, \fI/usr/games/hide\fP, that may only be accessed
by the \fIdm\fP program.  \fIDm\fP determines if the requested game is
available and, if so, runs it.  The file \fI/usr/games/game.control\fP

It is possibly more important that \fIdm\fP never be setuid anything

ability to play games at will.
