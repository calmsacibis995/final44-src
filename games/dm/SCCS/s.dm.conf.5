\fIDm.config\fP is the configuration file for the \fIdm\fP(8) program.  It
consists of three parts, each separated by percent signs (``%'')
occurring as the first two characters in a line.  Blank lines and lines
preceded by a hash mark (``#'') are ignored.

The first part of the file sets the standard games hours on a day-by-day
basis.  Entries consist of three white-space separated fields: the
unabbreviated day of the week and the beginning and ending time of the
period of the day when games may not be played.  The time fields are in a
0 based, 24-hour clock.  Any of the time fields may be a non-numeric
character, resulting in no time limitations for that day.

Any tty listed after the keyword ``badtty'' may not have games played on

``badtty'' and the ttyname as returned by \fIttyname\fP(3).  For example,

The third, and final, part sets specific game limitations.  Entries consist
of four white-space separated fields: the name of a game, the highest system
load average at which the game may be played, the maximum users allowed
if the game is to be played, and the priority at which the game is to be run.
Any of these fields may be a non-numeric character, resulting in no game
limitation or priority based on the field.  The game "default" controls the
settings for any game not otherwise listed.  Priorities may not be negative.

Any day/hour combination listed after the keyword ``time'' will disallow
games during those hours.  Entries consist of four white-space separated
fields: the string ``time'', the unabbreviated day of the week and the
beginning and ending time of a period of the day when games may not be
played.  The time fields are in a 0 based, 24-hour clock.  For example,
the following entry allows games playing before 8AM and after 5PM on
Mondays.

Any game listed after the keyword ``game'' will set parameters for a specific
game.  Entries consist of five white-space separated fields: the keyword
``game'', the name of a game, the highest system load average at which the
game may be played, the maximum users allowed if the game is to be played,
and the priority at which the game is to be run.  Any of these fields may
start with a non-numeric character, resulting in no game limitation or
priority based on that field.  The game "default" controls the settings for
any game not otherwise listed, and must be the last ``game'' entry in the
file.  Priorities may not be negative.  For example, the following entries
limits the game ``hack'' to running only when the system has 10 or less
users and a load average of 5 or less; all other games may be run any time
the system has 15 or less users.
