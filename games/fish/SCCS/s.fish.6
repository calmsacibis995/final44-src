D 4
plays the game of \*(lqGo Fish\*(rq,
a childrens' card game.  The Object is to
accumulate `books' of 4 cards with the same face value.  The
players alternate turns; each turn begins with one player
selecting a card from his hand, and asking the other player for
all cards of that face value.  If the other player has one or
more cards of that face value in his hand, he gives them to the
first player, and the first player makes another request.
Eventually, the first player asks for a card which is not in
the second player's hand: he replies `GO FISH!' The first
player then draws a card from the `pool' of undealt cards.  If
this is the card he had last requested, he draws again.  When a
book is made, either through drawing or requesting, the cards
are laid down and no further action takes place with that face
value.

To play the computer, simply make guesses by typing a,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, j, q, or k when asked.  Hitting
return gives you information about the size of my hand and the
pool, and tells you about my books.  Saying `p' as a first
guess puts you into `pro' level; The default is pretty dumb.

The computer deals the player and itself seven cards, and places
the rest of the deck face-down (figuratively).
The object of the game is to collect ``books'', or all of the members
of a single rank.
For example, collecting four 2's would give the player a ``book of
2's''.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-p
Professional mode.
.PP
The computer makes a random decision as to who gets to start the
game, and then the computer and player take turns asking each other
for cards of a specified rank.
If the asked player has any cards of the requested rank, they give
them up to the asking player.
A player must have at least one of the cards of the rank they request
in their hand.
When a player asks for a rank of which the other player has no
cards, the asker is told to ``Go Fish!''.
Then, the asker draws a card from the non-dealt cards.
If they draw the card they asked for, they continue their turn, asking
for more ranks from the other player.
Otherwise, the other player gets a turn.
.PP
When a player completes a book, either by getting cards from the
other player or drawing from the deck, they set those cards aside and
the rank is no longer in play.
.PP
The game ends when either player no longer has any cards in their hand.
The player with the most books wins.

.SH BUGS
The computer cheats only rarely.
