This is the traditional children's card game "Go Fish".  We each get seven
cards, and the rest of the deck is kept to be drawn from later.  The
object of the game is to collect "books", or all of the cards of a single
value.  For example, getting four 2's would give you a "book of 2's".

We take turns asking each other for cards, but you can't ask me for a card
value if you don't have one of them in your hand!  If I have any cards of
the value you ask for, I have to give them to you.  As long as I have one
of the cards you ask for, you get to keep asking.  If you ask me for a
card of which I don't have any, then I'll tell you to "Go Fish!"  This
means that you draw a card from the deck.  If you draw the card you asked
me for, you get to keep asking me for cards.  If not, it's my turn and I ask
you for a card.

Sometimes you get to ask first, sometimes I do.  I'll tell you when it's
your turn to move, I'll draw cards from the deck for you, and I'll tell
you what you have in your hand.  (Don't worry, I don't look at your hand
when I'm trying to decide what card to ask for, honest!)

Your input can be a card name ("A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8",
"9", "10", "J", "Q" or "K") or the letter "p", or "quit".  The letter "p"
makes my game much smarter, and the line "quit" stops the game.  Just
hitting the carriage return key displays how many cards I have in my hand,
how many are left in the deck, and which books I've gotten.

Normally, the game stops when one of us runs out of cards, and the winner
is whoever has the most books!

Good luck!
