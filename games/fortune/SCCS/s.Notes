==> GENERAL INFORMATION
	By default, fortune retrieves its fortune files from the directory
/usr/share/games/fortune.  A fortune file has two parts: the source file
(which contains the fortunes themselves) and the data file which describes
the fortunes.  The data fil always has the same name as the fortune file
with the string ".dat" concatenated, i.e. "fort" is the standard fortune
database, and "fort.dat" is the data file which describes it.  See
strfile(8) for more information on creating the data files.
	Fortunes are split into potentially offensive and not potentially
offensive parts.  The offensive version of a file has the same name as the
non-offensive version with "-o" concatenated, i.e. "fort" is the standard
fortune database, and "fort-o" is the standard offensive database.  The
fortune program automatically assumes that any file with a name ending in
"-o" is potentially offensive, and should therefore only be displayed if
explicitly requested, either with the -o option or by specifying a file name
on the command line.
	Potentially offensive fortune files should NEVER be maintained in
clear text on the system.  They are rotated (see caesar(6)) 13 positions.
To create a new, potentially offensive database, use caesar to rotate it,
and then create its data file with the -x option to strfile(8).  The fortune
program automatically decrypts the text when it prints entries from such
databases.
	Anything which would not make it onto network prime time programming
(or which would only be broadcast if some discredited kind of guy said it)
MUST be in the potentially offensive database.  Fortunes containing any
explicit language (see George Carlin's recent updated list) MUST be in the
potentially offensive database.  Political and religious opinions are often
sequestered in the potentially offensive section as well.  Anything which
assumes as a world view blatantly racist, mysogynist (sexist), or homophobic
ideas should not be in either, since they are not really funny unless *you*
are racist, mysogynist, or homophobic.
	The point of this is that people have should have a reasonable
expectation that, should they just run "fortune", they will not be offended.
We know that some people take offense at anything, but normal people do have
opinions, too, and have a right not to have their sensibilities offended by
a program which is supposed to be entertaining.  People who run "fortune
-o" or "fortune -a" are saying, in effect, that they are willing to have
their sensibilities tweaked.  However, they should not have their personal
worth seriously (i.e., not in jest) assaulted.  Jokes which depend for their
humor on racist, mysogynist, or homophobic stereotypes *do* seriously
assault individual personal worth, and in an general entertainment medium
we should be able to get by without it.

[All examples are indented by one tab stop -- KCRCA]

Numbers should be given in parentheses, e.g.,

	(1)	Everything depends.

	(3)	Everything is sometimes.

Attributions are two tab stops, followed by two hyphens, followed by a
space, followed by the attribution, and are *not* preceded by blank

Attributions which do not fit on one (72 char) line should be continued
on a line which lines up below the first text of the attribution, e.g.,
