.I Robots
D 4
pits you against evil robots,
who are trying to kill you
(which is why they are evil).
Fortunately for you,
even though they are evil,
they are not very bright
and have a habit of bumping into each other,
thus destroying themselves.
In order to survive,
you must get them to kill each other off,
since you have no offensive weaponry.

The object of the game chase is to move around inside of the box on the
screen without getting eaten by the robots chasing and without running
into anything.

Since you are stuck without offensive weaponry,
you are endowed with one piece of defensive weaponry:
a teleportation device.
When two robots run into each other or a junk pile,
they die.
If a robot runs into you,
you die.
When a robot dies, you get 10 points,
and when all the robots die,

If a robot runs into another robot while chasing you, they crash and leave
a junk heap.  If a robot runs into a fence, it is destroyed.

Robots are represented on the screen by a

the junk heaps from their collisions by a

and you

by a
