.sh 1 Introduction
.pp
You have just finished your years as a student at the local fighter's guild.
After much practice and sweat you have finally completed your training
and are ready to embark upon a perilous adventure.
As a test of your skills,
the local guildmasters have sent you into the Dungeons of Doom.
Your task is to return with the Amulet of Yendor.
Your reward for the completion of this task
will be a full membership in the local guild.
In addition,
you are allowed to keep all the loot you bring back from the dungeons.
.pp
In preparation for your journey,
you are given an enchanted mace,
a bow, and a quiver of arrows
taken from a dragon's hoard in the far off Dark Mountains.
You are also outfitted with elf-crafted armor
and given enough food to reach the dungeons.
You say goodbye to family and friends for what may be the last time
and head up the road.
.pp
You set out on your way to the dungeons
and after several days of uneventful travel,
you see the ancient ruins
that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of Doom.
It is late at night,
so you make camp at the entrance
and spend the night sleeping under the open skies.
D 2
In the morning you gather your sword,
E 2
I 2
In the morning you gather your weapons,
E 2
put on your armor,
eat what is almost your last food,
and enter the dungeons.
.sh 1 "What is going on here?"
.pp
You have just begun a game of rogue.
Your goal is to grab as much treasure as you can,
find the Amulet of Yendor,
and get out of the Dungeons of Doom alive.
On the screen,
a map of where you have been
and what you have seen on the current dungeon level is kept.
As you explore more of the level,
it appears on the screen in front of you.
.pp
Rogue differs from most computer fantasy games in that it is screen oriented.
Commands are all one or two keystrokes\**
.(f
\** As opposed to pseudo English sentences.
.)f
and the results of your commands
are displayed graphically on the screen rather
D 2
than being explained in words.
E 2
I 2
than being explained in words.\**
.(f
\** A minimum screen size of 24 lines by 80 columns is required.
If the screen is larger, only the 24x80 section will be used
for the map.
.)f
E 2
.pp
Another major difference between rogue and other computer fantasy games
is that once you have solved all the puzzles in a standard fantasy game,
it has lost most of its excitement and it ceases to be fun.
Rogue,
on the other hand,
generates a new dungeon every time you play it
and even the author finds it an entertaining and exciting game.
.sh 1 "What do all those things on the screen mean?"
.pp
In order to understand what is going on in rogue
you have to first get some grasp of what rogue is doing with the screen.
The rogue screen is intended
to replace the \*(lqYou can see ...\*(rq descriptions
of standard fantasy games.
Figure 1 is a sample of what a rogue screen might look like.

.sh 2 "The bottom line"
.pp
At the bottom line of the screen
are a few pieces of cryptic information
describing your current status.
Here is an explanation of what these things mean:
.ip Level \w'Level\ \ 'u
This number indicates how deep you have gone in the dungeon.
It starts at one and goes up as you go deeper into the dungeon.
.ip Gold \w'Level\ \ 'u
The number of gold pieces you have managed to find
and keep with you so far.
.ip Hp \w'Level\ \ 'u
D 3
Your current and maximum hit points.
Hit points indicate how much damage you can take before you die.
E 3
I 3
Your current and maximum health points.
Health points indicate how much damage you can take before you die.
E 3
The more you get hit in a fight,
the lower they get.
D 3
You can regain hit points by resting.
E 3
I 3
You can regain health points by resting.
E 3
The number in parentheses
D 3
is the maximum number your hit points can reach.
E 3
I 3
is the maximum number your health points can reach.
E 3
.ip Str \w'Level\ \ 'u
D 2
Your current strength.
E 2
I 2
Your current strength and maximum ever strength.
E 2
D 5
This can be any integer less than or equal to 31,
or greater than or equal to three.
E 5
I 5
This can be any integer less than or equal to 99,
or greater than or equal to 1.
E 5
The higher the number,
the stronger you are.
I 2
The number in the parentheses
is the maximum strength you have attained so far this game.
E 2
D 3
.ip Ac \w'Level\ \ 'u
Your current armor class.
E 3
I 3
.ip Arm \w'Level\ \ 'u
Your current armor protection.
E 3
This number indicates how effective your armor is
in stopping blows from unfriendly creatures.
D 3
The lower this number is,
E 3
I 3
The higher this number is,
E 3
the more effective the armor.
.ip Exp \w'Level\ \ 'u
These two numbers give your current experience level
and experience points.
As you do things,
you gain experience points.
At certain experience point totals,
you gain an experience level.
The more experienced you are,
the better you are able to fight and to withstand magical attacks.
.sh 2 "The top line"
.pp
The top line of the screen is reserved
for printing messages that describe things
that are impossible to represent visually.
If you see a \*(lq--More--\*(rq on the top line,
this means that rogue wants to print another message on the screen,
but it wants to make certain
that you have read the one that is there first.
To read the next message,
just type a space.
.sh 2 "The rest of the screen"
.pp
The rest of the screen is the map of the level
as you have explored it so far.
Each symbol on the screen represents something.
Here is a list of what the various symbols mean:
.ip @
This symbol represents you, the adventurer.
.ip "-\^|"
These symbols represent the walls of rooms.
.ip +
A door to/from a room.
.ip .
The floor of a room.
.ip #
The floor of a passage between rooms.
.ip *
A pile or pot of gold.
.ip )
A weapon of some sort.
.ip ]
A piece of armor.
.ip !
A flask containing a magic potion.
.ip ?
A piece of paper, usually a magic scroll.
.ip =
A ring with magic properties
.ip /
A magical staff or wand
.ip ^
A trap, watch out for these.
.ip %
A staircase to other levels
.ip :
A piece of food.
.ip A-Z
The uppercase letters
represent the various inhabitants of the Dungeons of Doom.
Watch out, they can be nasty and vicious.
.sh 1 Commands
.pp
Commands are given to rogue by typing one or two characters.
Most commands can be preceded by a count to repeat them
(e.g. typing 
.Cs 10s
will do ten searches).
Commands for which counts make no sense
have the count ignored.
To cancel a count or a prefix,
type \*E.
The list of commands is rather long,
but it can be read at any time during the game with the
.Cs ?
command.
Here it is for reference,
with a short explanation of each command.
.ip ?
The help command.
Asks for a character to give help on.
If you type a
.Cs * ,
it will list all the commands,
otherwise it will explain what the character you typed does.
.ip /
This is the \*(lqWhat is that on the screen?\*(rq command.
A
.Cs /
followed by any character that you see on the level,
will tell you what that character is.
For instance,
typing
.Cs /@
will tell you that the
.Cs @
symbol represents you, the player.
D 2
.ip "h, H"
E 2
I 2
.ip "h, H, ^H"
E 2
Move left.
You move one space to the left.
If you use upper case
.Cs h ,
you will continue to move left until you run into something.
This works for all movement commands
(e.g.
.Cs L
means run in direction 
.Cs l )
I 2
If you use the \*(lqcontrol\*(rq
.Cs h ,
you will continue moving in the specified direction
until you pass something interesting or run into a wall.
You should experiment with this,
since it is a very useful command,
but very difficult to describe.
This also works for all movement commands.
E 2
.ip j
Move down.
.ip k
Move up.
.ip l
Move right.
.ip y
Move diagonally up and left.
.ip u
Move diagonally up and right.
.ip b
Move diagonally down and left.
.ip n
Move diagonally down and right.
.ip t
Throw an object.
This is a prefix command.
When followed with a direction
it throws an object in the specified direction.
(e.g. type
.Cs th
to throw
something to the left.)
.ip f
D 2
Find prefix.
When followed by a direction
it means to continue moving in the specified direction
until you pass something interesting or run into a wall.
You should experiment with this,
since it is a very useful command,
but very difficult to describe.
E 2
I 2
Fight until someone dies.
When followed with a direction
this will force you to fight the creature in that direction
until either you or it bites the big one.
.ip m
Move onto something without picking it up.
This will move you one space in the direction you specify and,
if there is an object there you can pick up,
it won't do it.
E 2
.ip z
Zap prefix.
Point a staff or wand in a given direction
and fire it.
Even non-directional staves must be pointed in some direction
to be used.
.ip ^
Identify trap command.
If a trap is on your map
and you can't remember what type it is,
you can get rogue to remind you
by getting next to it and typing
.Cs ^
followed by the direction that would move you on top of it.
.ip s
Search for traps and secret doors.
Examine each space immediately adjacent to you
for the existence of a trap or secret door.
There is a large chance that even if there is something there,
you won't find it,
so you might have to search a while before you find something.
.ip >
Climb down a staircase to the next level.
Not surprisingly, this can only be done if you are standing on staircase.
.ip <
Climb up a staircase to the level above.
This can't be done without the Amulet of Yendor in your possession.
.ip "."
Rest.
This is the \*(lqdo nothing\*(rq command.
This is good for waiting and healing.
D 2
.ip i
E 2
I 2
D 3
.ip *
E 3
I 3
.ip ,
Pick up something.
This picks up whatever you are currently standing on,
if you are standing on anything at all.
.ip i
E 3
E 2
Inventory.
List what you are carrying in your pack.
.ip I
Selective inventory.
Tells you what a single item in your pack is.
.ip q
Quaff one of the potions you are carrying.
.ip r
Read one of the scrolls in your pack.
.ip e
Eat food from your pack.
.ip w
Wield a weapon.
Take a weapon out of your pack and carry it for use in combat,
replacing the one you are currently using (if any).
.ip W
Wear armor.
You can only wear one suit of armor at a time.
This takes extra time.
.ip T
Take armor off.
You can't remove armor that is cursed.
This takes extra time.
.ip P
Put on a ring.
You can wear only two rings at a time
(one on each hand).
If you aren't wearing any rings,
this command will ask you which hand you want to wear it on,
otherwise, it will place it on the unused hand.
The program assumes that you wield your sword in your right hand.
.ip R
Remove a ring.
If you are only wearing one ring,
this command takes it off.
If you are wearing two,
it will ask you which one you wish to remove,
.ip d
Drop an object.
Take something out of your pack and leave it lying on the floor.
Only one object can occupy each space.
You cannot drop a cursed object at all
if you are wielding or wearing it.
.ip c
Call an object something.
If you have a type of object in your pack
which you wish to remember something about,
you can use the call command to give a name to that type of object.
This is usually used when you figure out what a
potion, scroll, ring, or staff is
D 2
after you pick it up.
(See the
.Cs askme
option below.)
E 2
I 2
D 5
after you pick it up,
or when you want to remember
which of those swords in your pack you were wielding.
E 2
.ip D
Print out which things you've discovered something about.
This command will ask you what type of thing you are interested in.
If you type the character for a given type of object
(\fIe.g.\fP
.Cs !
for potion)
it will tell you which kinds of that type of object you've discovered
(\fIi.e.\fP, figured out what they are).
This command works for potions, scrolls, rings, and staves and wands.
E 5
I 5
after you pick it up but before it is truly identified.  Each type of
scroll and potion will become identified after its first use.
E 5
.ip o
Examine and set options.
This command is further explained in the section on options.
D 2
.ip ^L
E 2
I 2
.ip ^R
E 2
Redraws the screen.
Useful if spurious messages or transmission errors
have messed up the display.
D 2
.ip ^R
Repeat last message.
E 2
I 2
.ip ^P
Print last message.
E 2
Useful when a message disappears before you can read it.
D 5
This only repeats the last message
that was not a mistyped command
so that you don't loose anything by accidentally typing
D 2
the wrong character instead of ^R.
E 2
I 2
the wrong character instead of ^P.
E 5
I 5
Consecutive repetitions of this command will reveal the last
five messages.
E 5
E 2
.ip \*E
Cancel a command, prefix, or count.
.ip !
Escape to a shell for some commands.
.ip Q
Quit.
Leave the game.
.ip S
Save the current game in a file.
It will ask you whether you wish to use the default save file.
.i Caveat :
Rogue won't let you start up a copy of a saved game,
and it removes the save file as soon as you start up a restored game.
This is to prevent people from saving a game just before a dangerous position
and then restarting it if they die.
To restore a saved game,
give the file name as an argument to rogue.
As in
.ti +1i
.nf
% rogue \fIsave\*_file\fP
D 5
.ip
To restart from the default save file (see below),
run
.ti +1i
.nf
% rogue \-r
E 5
.ip v
Prints the program version number.
I 2
.ip )
Print the weapon you are currently wielding
.ip ]
Print the armor you are currently wearing
.ip =
Print the rings you are currently wearing
D 5
.ip @
Reprint the status line on the message line
E 5
E 2
.sh 1 Rooms
.pp
D 5
Rooms in the dungeons are either lit or dark.
If you walk into a lit room,
the entire room will be drawn on the screen as soon as you enter.
If you walk into a dark room,
it will only be displayed as you explore it.
E 5
I 5
Rooms in the dungeons are lit as you enter them.
E 5
Upon leaving a room,
D 2
all objects inside the room which might move
or be removed
E 2
I 2
D 5
all monsters inside the room
E 2
are erased from the screen.
In the darkness you can only see one space
E 5
I 5
all monsters inside the room are erased from the screen.
In the darkness of a corridor, you can only see one space
E 5
in all directions around you.
D 5
A corridor is always dark.
E 5
.sh 1 Fighting
.pp
If you see a monster and you wish to fight it,
just attempt to run into it.
Many times a monster you find will mind its own business
unless you attack it.
It is often the case that discretion is the better part of valor.
.sh 1 "Objects you can find"
.pp
When you find something in the dungeon,
it is common to want to pick the object up.
D 2
This is accomplished in rogue by walking over the object.
E 2
I 2
This is accomplished in rogue by walking over the object
(unless you use the
.Cs m
prefix, see above).
E 2
If you are carrying too many things,
the program will tell you and it won't pick up the object,
otherwise it will add it to your pack
and tell you what you just picked up.
.pp
Many of the commands that operate on objects must prompt you
to find out which object you want to use.
If you change your mind and don't want to do that command after all,
just type an \*E and the command will be aborted.
.pp
Some objects, like armor and weapons,
are easily differentiated.
Others, like scrolls and potions,
are given labels which vary according to type.
During a game,
any two of the same kind of object
with the same label
are the same type.
However,
the labels will vary from game to game.
.pp
When you use one of these labeled objects,
D 5
if its effect is obvious,
rogue will remember what it is for you.
D 2
If it's effect isn't extremely obvious, you can use the
E 2
I 2
If it's effect isn't extremely obvious
you will be asked what you want to scribble on it
E 5
I 5
if its effect may be obvious.  Potions or scrolls will
become identified at this point, but not other items.
You may want to call these other items something
E 5
so you will recognize it later,
D 5
or you can use the
E 5
I 5
you can use the
E 5
E 2
.Cs call
command
D 2
(see above)
or the
.Cs askme
option
(see below)
to scribble down something about it
so you will recognize it later.
E 2
I 2
(see above).
E 2
.sh 2 Weapons
.pp
Some weapons,
like arrows,
come in bunches,
but most come one at a time.
In order to use a weapon,
you must wield it.
To fire an arrow out of a bow,
you must first wield the bow,
then throw the arrow.
You can only wield one weapon at a time,
but you can't change weapons if the one
you are currently wielding is cursed.
I 2
The commands to use weapons are
.Cs w
(wield)
and
.Cs t
(throw).
E 2
.sh 2 Armor
.pp
There are various sorts of armor lying around in the dungeon.
Some of it is enchanted,
some is cursed,
and some is just normal.
D 3
Different armor types have different armor classes.
The lower the armor class,
E 3
I 3
Different armor types have different armor protection.
The higher the armor protection,
E 3
the more protection the armor affords against the blows of monsters.

I 2
Scrolls come with titles in an unknown tongue\**.
.(f
\** Actually, it's a dialect spoken only by the twenty-seven members
of a tribe in Outer Mongolia,
but you're not supposed to

that.
.)f
E 2
After you read a scroll,
it disappears from your pack.
I 2
The command to use a scroll is
.Cs r
(read).
E 2
.sh 2 Potions
.pp
Potions are labeled by the color of the liquid inside the flask.
They disappear after being quaffed.
I 2
The command to use a scroll is
.Cs q

E 2
.sh 2 "Staves and Wands"
.pp
Staves and wands do the same kinds of things.
Staves are identified by a type of wood;
wands by a type of metal or bone.
They are generally things you want to do to something
over a long distance,
so you must point them at what you wish to affect
to use them.
Some staves are not affected by the direction they are pointed, though.
Staves come with multiple magic charges,
the number being random,
and when they are used up,
the staff is just a piece of wood or metal.
I 2
.pp
The command to use a wand or staff is
.Cs z
(zap)
E 2
.sh 2 Rings
.pp
Rings are very useful items,
since they are relatively permanent magic,
unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and staves.
Of course,
the bad rings are also more powerful.
Most rings also cause you to use up food more rapidly,
the rate varying with the type of ring.
Rings are differentiated by their stone settings.
I 2
The commands to use rings are
.Cs P
(put on)
and
.Cs R
(remove).
.sh 2 Food
.pp
Food is necessary to keep you going.
If you go too long without eating you will faint,
and eventually die of starvation.
The command to use food is
.Cs e
(eat).
E 2
.sh 1 Options
.pp
Due to variations in personal tastes
and conceptions of the way rogue should do things,
there are a set of options you can set
that cause rogue to behave in various different ways.
I 10
.ne 1i
E 10
.sh 2 "Setting the options"
.pp
There are two ways to set the options.
The first is with the
.Cs o
command of rogue;
the second is with the
.Cs ROGUEOPTS
environment variable\**.
.(f
\** On Version 6 systems,
there is no equivalent of the ROGUEOPTS feature.
.br
.)f
.br
.sh 3 "Using the `o' command"
.pp
When you type
.Cs o
in rogue,
it clears the screen
and displays the current settings for all the options.
It then places the cursor by the value of the first option
and waits for you to type.
You can type a \*R
which means to go to the next option,
a
.Cs \-
which means to go to the previous option,
an \*E
which means to return to the game,
or you can give the option a value.
For boolean options this merely involves typing
.Cs t
for true or
.Cs f
for false.
For string options,
type the new value followed by a \*R.
.sh 3 "Using the ROGUEOPTS variable"
.pp
The ROGUEOPTS variable is a string
containing a comma separated list of initial values
for the various options.
Boolean variables can be turned on by listing their name
or turned off by putting a
.Cs no
in front of the name.
Thus to set up an environment variable so that
.b jump
is on,
D 5
.b terse
E 5
I 5
.b passgo
E 5
is off,
and the

.sh 2 "Option list"
.pp
Here is a list of the options
and an explanation of what each one is for.
The default value for each is enclosed in square brackets.
I 2
For character string options,
D 5
input over fifty characters will be ignored.
E 2
.ip "\fBterse\fP [\fI\^noterse\^\fP]"
Useful for those who are tired of the sometimes lengthy messages of rogue.
This is a useful option for playing on slow terminals,
so this option defaults to
D 2
.b terse
if your
E 2
I 2
.i terse
if you
E 2
are on a slow (1200 baud or under) terminal.
E 5
I 5
input over forty characters will be ignored.
E 5
.ip "\fBjump\fP [\fI\^nojump\^\fP]"
If this option is set,
running moves will not be displayed
until you reach the end of the move.
This saves considerable cpu and display time.
This option defaults to
D 2
.b jump
E 2
I 2
.i jump
E 2
if you are using a slow terminal.
D 2
.ip "\fBstep\fP [\fI\^nostep\^\fP]"
When
.b step
is set,
lists of things,
like inventories or
.Cs *
responses to
\*(lqWhich item do you wish to \fB. . .\fP? \*(rq questions,
are displayed one item at a time on the top of the screen,
rather than clearing the screen,
displaying the list,
then re-displaying the dungeon level.
E 2
D 5
.ip "\fBflush\fP [\fI\^noflush\^\fP]"
All typeahead is thrown away after each round of battle.
This is useful for those who type far ahead
D 2
and then watch in dismay as a Kobold kills them.
.ip "\fBaskme\fP [\fI\^noaskme\^\fP]"
Upon reading a scroll or quaffing a potion
which does not automatically identify itself upon use,
rogue will ask you what to name it
so you can recognize it if you encounter it again.
E 2
I 2
and then watch in dismay as a Bat kills them.
.ip "\fBseefloor\fP [\fI\^seefloor\^\fP]"
Display the floor around you on the screen
as you move through dark rooms.
Due to the amount of characters generated,
this option defaults to
.i noseefloor
if you are using a slow terminal.
E 5
E 2
.ip "\fBpassgo\fP [\fI\^nopassgo\^\fP]"
Follow turnings in passageways.
If you run in a passage
and you run into stone or a wall,
rogue will see if it can turn to the right or left.
If it can only turn one way,
it will turn that way.
If it can turn either or neither,
it will stop.
D 4
This is followed strictly,
which can sometimes lead to slightly confusing occurrences
D 2
(which is why it defaults to being off).
The
.Cs f
prefix still works.
E 2
I 2
(which is why it defaults to 
.i nopassgo ).
E 4
I 4
This algorithm can sometimes lead to slightly confusing occurrences
which is why it defaults to \fInopassgo\fP.
E 4
D 5
.ip "\fBtombstone\fP [\fI\^tombstone\^\fP]"
Print out the tombstone at the end if you get killed.
E 5
I 5
.ip "\fBskull\fP [\fI\^skull\^\fP]"
Print out the skull at the end if you get killed.
E 5
This is nice but slow, so you can turn it off if you like.
D 5
.ip "\fBinven\fP [\fI\^overwrite\^\fP]"
Inventory type.
This can have one of three values:
.i overwrite ,
.i slow ,
or
.i clear .
With
.i overwrite
the top lines of the map are overwritten
with the list
when inventory is requested
or when
\*(lqWhich item do you wish to \fB. . .\fP? \*(rq questions
are answered with a
.Cs * .
However, if the list is longer than a screenful,
the screen is cleared.
With
.i slow ,
lists are displayed one item at a time on the top of the screen,
and with
.i clear ,
the screen is cleared,
the list is displayed,
and then the dungeon level is re-displayed.
Due to speed considerations,
.i clear
is the default for terminals without
clear-to-end-of-line capabilities.
E 5
E 2
.ip "\fBname\fP [account name]"
This is the name of your character.
It is used if you get on the top ten scorer's list.
D 2
It should be less than forty characters long.
E 2
.ip "\fBfruit\fP [\fI\^slime-mold\^\fP]"
This should hold the name of a fruit that you enjoy eating.
D 2
It is basically a whimsey that the program uses in a couple of places.
E 2
I 2
It is basically a whimsey that rogue uses in a couple of places.
E 2
.ip "\fBfile\fP [\fI\^~/rogue.save\^\fP]"
The default file name for saving the game.
If your phone is hung up by accident,
rogue will automatically save the game in this file.
D 2
The file name may contain the special character
E 2
I 2
The file name may start with the special character
E 2
.Cs ~
which expands to be your home directory.
.sh 1 Scoring

of the top ten scoring people on your machine.
Each account on the machine
E 2
I 2
of the top scoring people or scores on your machine.
D 5
Depending on how it is set up,
it can post either the top scores
or the top players.
In the latter case,
each account on the machine
E 2
can post only one non-winning score on this list.
E 5
If you score higher than someone else on this list,
or better your previous score on the list,
you will be inserted in the proper place
under your current name.
I 2
D 5
How many scores are kept
can also be set up by whoever installs it on your machine.
E 5
E 2
.pp
If you quit the game, you get out with all of your gold intact.
If, however, you get killed in the Dungeons of Doom,
your body is forwarded to your next-of-kin,
along with 90% of your gold;
D 2
ten percent of your gold is kept by the Dungeons' wizard as a fee.
E 2
I 2
