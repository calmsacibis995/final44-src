 * A `shape' is the fundamental thing that makes up the game.  There
 * are 7 basic shapes, each consisting of four `blots':
 *
 *	X.X	  X.X		X.X
 *	  X.X	X.X	X.X.X	X.X	X.X.X	X.X.X	X.X.X.X
 *			  X		X	    X
 *
 *	  0	  1	  2	  3	  4	  5	  6
 *
 * Except for 3 and 6, the center of each shape is one of the blots.
 * This blot is designated (0,0).  The other three blots can then be
 * described as offsets from the center.  Shape 3 is the same under
 * rotation, so its center is effectively irrelevant; it has been chosen
 * so that it `sticks out' upward and leftward.  Except for shape 6,
 * all the blots are contained in a box going from (-1,-1) to (+1,+1);
 * shape 6's center `wobbles' as it rotates, so that while it `sticks out'
 * rightward, its rotation---a vertical line---`sticks out' downward.
 * The containment box has to include the offset (2,0), making the overall
 * containment box range from offset (-1,-1) to (+2,+1).  (This is why
 * there is only one row above, but two rows below, the display area.)
 *
 * The game works by choosing one of these shapes at random and putting
 * its center at the middle of the first display row (row 1, column 5).
 * The shape is moved steadily downward until it collides with something:
 * either  another shape, or the bottom of the board.  When the shape can
 * no longer be moved downwards, it is merged into the current board.
 * At this time, any completely filled rows are elided, and blots above
 * these rows move down to make more room.  A new random shape is again
 * introduced at the top of the board, and the whole process repeats.
 * The game ends when the new shape will not fit at (1,5).
 *
 * While the shapes are falling, the user can rotate them counterclockwise
 * 90 degrees (in addition to moving them left or right), provided that the
 * rotation puts the blots in empty spaces.  The table of shapes is set up
 * so that each shape contains the index of the new shape obtained by
 * rotating the current shape.  Due to symmetry, each shape has exactly
 * 1, 2, or 4 rotations total; the first 7 entries in the table represent
 * the primary shapes, and the remaining 12 represent their various
 * rotated forms.

 * depending on its current value, via the `faster' macro below.
