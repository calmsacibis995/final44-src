/*
**  Klingon Attack Routine
**
**	This routine performs the Klingon attack provided that
**	(1) Something happened this move (i.e., not free), and
**	(2) You are not cloaked.  Note that if you issue the
**	cloak command, you are not considered cloaked until you
**	expend some time.
**
**	Klingons are permitted to move both before and after the
**	attack.  They will tend to move toward you before the
**	attack and away from you after the attack.
**
**	Under certain conditions you can get a critical hit.  This
**	sort of hit damages devices.  The probability that a given
**	device is damaged depends on the device.  Well protected
**	devices (such as the computer, which is in the core of the
**	ship and has considerable redundancy) almost never get
**	damaged, whereas devices which are exposed (such as the
**	warp engines) or which are particularly delicate (such as
**	the transporter) have a much higher probability of being
**	damaged.
**
**	The actual amount of damage (i.e., how long it takes to fix
**	it) depends on the amount of the hit and the "damfac[]"
**	entry for the particular device.
**
**	Casualties can also occur.
