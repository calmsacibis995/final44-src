/*
**  On-Board Computer
**
**	A computer request is fetched from the captain.  The requests
**	are:
**
**	chart -- print a star chart of the known galaxy.  This includes
**		every quadrant that has ever had a long range or
**		a short range scan done of it, plus the location of
**		all starbases.  This is of course updated by any sub-
**		space radio broadcasts (unless the radio is out).
**		The format is the same as that of a long range scan
**		except that ".1." indicates that a starbase exists
**		but we know nothing else.
**
**	trajectory -- gives the course and distance to every know
**		Klingon in the quadrant.  Obviously this fails if the
**		short range scanners are out.
**
**	course -- gives a course computation from whereever you are
**		to any specified location.  If the course begins
**		with a slash, the current quadrant is taken.
**		Otherwise the input is quadrant and sector coordi-
**		nates of the target sector.
**
**	move -- identical to course, except that the move is performed.
**
**	score -- prints out the current score.
**
**	pheff -- "PHaser EFFectiveness" at a given distance.  Tells
**		you how much stuff you need to make it work.
**
**	warpcost -- Gives you the cost in time and units to move for
**		a given distance under a given warp speed.
**
**	impcost -- Same for the impulse engines.
**
**	distresslist -- Gives a list of the currently known starsystems
**		or starbases which are distressed, together with their
**		quadrant coordinates.
**
**	If a command is terminated with a semicolon, you remain in
**	the computer; otherwise, you escape immediately to the main
**	command processor.
