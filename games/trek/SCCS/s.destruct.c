/*
**  Self Destruct Sequence
**
**	The computer starts up the self destruct sequence.  Obviously,
**	if the computer is out nothing can happen.  You get a countdown
**	and a request for password.  This must match the password that
**	you entered at the start of the game.
**
**	You get to destroy things when you blow up; hence, it is
**	possible to win the game by destructing if you take the last
**	Klingon with you.
**
**	By the way, the \032 in the message is a ^Z, which is because
**	the terminal in my office is an ADM-3, which uses that char-
**	acter to clear the screen.  I also stick in a \014 (form feed)
**	because that clears some other screens.
**
**	Uses trace flag 41
