**  call starbase for help
**
**	First, the closest starbase is selected.  If there is a
**	a starbase in your own quadrant, you are in good shape.
**	This distance takes quadrant distances into account only.
**
**	A magic number is computed based on the distance which acts
**	as the probability that you will be rematerialized.  You
**	get three tries.
**
**	When it is determined that you should be able to be remater-
**	ialized (i.e., when the probability thing mentioned above
**	comes up positive), you are put into that quadrant (anywhere).
**	Then, we try to see if there is a spot adjacent to the star-
**	base.  If not, you can't be rematerialized!!!  Otherwise,
**	it drops you there.  It only tries five times to find a spot
**	to drop you.  After that, it's your problem.
