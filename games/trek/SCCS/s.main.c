**
**	C version by Eric P. Allman 5/76 (U.C. Berkeley) with help
**		from Jeff Poskanzer and Pete Rubinstein.
**
**	I also want to thank everyone here at Berkeley who
**	where crazy enough to play the undebugged game.  I want to
**	particularly thank Nick Whyte, who made considerable
**	suggestions regarding the content of the game.  Why, I'll
**	never forget the time he suggested the name for the
**	"capture" command.
**
**	Please send comments, questions, and suggestions about this
**		game to:
**			Eric P. Allman
**			Project INGRES
**			Electronics Research Laboratory
**			Cory Hall
**			University of California
**			Berkeley, California  94720
**
**	If you make ANY changes in the game, I sure would like to
**	know about them.  It is sort of an ongoing project for me,
**	and I very much want to put in any bug fixes and improvements
**	that you might come up with.
**
**	FORTRASH version by Kay R. Fisher (DEC) "and countless others".
**	That was adapted from the "original BASIC program" (ha!) by
**		Mike Mayfield (Centerline Engineering).
**
**	Additional inspiration taken from FORTRAN version by
**		David Matuszek and Paul Reynolds which runs on the CDC
**		7600 at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, maintained there by
**		Andy Davidson.  This version is also available at LLL
**		and at LMSC.  In all fairness, this version was the
**		major inspiration for this version of the game (trans-
**		lation:  I ripped off a whole lot of code).
**
**	Minor other input from the "Battelle Version 7A" by Joe Miller
**		(Graphics Systems Group, Battelle-Columbus Labs) and
**		Ross Pavlac (Systems Programmer, Battelle Memorial
**		Institute).  That version was written in December '74
**		and extensively modified June '75.  It was adapted
**		from the FTN version by Ron Williams of CDC Sunnyvale,
**		which was adapted from the Basic version distributed
**		by DEC.  It also had "neat stuff swiped" from T. T.
**		Terry and Jim Korp (University of Texas), Hicks (Penn
**		U.), and Rick Maus (Georgia Tech).  Unfortunately, it
**		was not as readable as it could have been and so the
**		translation effort was severely hampered.  None the
**		less, I got the idea of inhabited starsystems from this
**		version.
**
**	Permission is given for use, copying, and modification of
**		all or part of this program and related documentation,
**		provided that all reference to the authors are maintained.
**

**********************************************************************
**
**  NOTES TO THE MAINTAINER:
**
**	There is a compilation option xTRACE which must be set for any
**	trace information to be generated.  It is probably defined in
**	the version that you get.  It can be removed, however, if you
**	have trouble finding room in core.
**
**	Many things in trek are not as clear as they might be, but are
**	done to reduce space.  I compile with the -f and -O flags.  I
**	am constrained to running with non-seperated I/D space, since
D 2
**	we don't have floating point hardware here; even if we did, I
E 2
I 2
**	we don't have doubleing point hardware here; even if we did, I
E 2
**	would like trek to be available to the large number of people
**	who either have an 11/40 or do not have FP hardware.  I also
**	found it desirable to make the code run reentrant, so this
**	added even more space constraints.
**
**	I use the portable C library to do my I/O.  This is done be-
**	cause I wanted the game easily transportable to other C
D 2
**	implementations, and because I was too lazy to do the floating
E 2
I 2
**	implementations, and because I was too lazy to do the doubleing
E 2
**	point input myself.  Little did I know.  The portable C library
**	released by Bell Labs has more bugs than you would believe, so
**	I ended up rewriting the whole blessed thing.  Trek excercises
**	many of the bugs in it, as well as bugs in some of the section
**	III UNIX routines.  We have fixed them here.  One main problem
**	was a bug in alloc() that caused it to always ask for a large
**	hunk of memory, which worked fine unless you were almost out,
**	which I inevitably was.  If you want the code for all of this
**	stuff, it is also available through me.
