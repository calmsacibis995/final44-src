/*
**  CAUSE A NOVA TO OCCUR
**
**	A nova occurs.  It is the result of having a star hit with
**	a photon torpedo.  There are several things which may happen.
**	The star may not be affected.  It may go nova.  It may turn
**	into a black hole.  Any (yummy) it may go supernova.
**
**	Stars that go nova cause stars which surround them to undergo
**	the same probabilistic process.  Klingons next to them are
**	destroyed.  And if the starship is next to it, it gets zapped.
**	If the zap is too much, it gets destroyed.
