/*
**  CAUSE SUPERNOVA TO OCCUR
**
**	A supernova occurs.  If 'ix' < 0, a random quadrant is chosen;
**	otherwise, the current quadrant is taken, and (ix, iy) give
**	the sector quadrants of the star which is blowing up.
**
**	If the supernova turns out to be in the quadrant you are in,
**	you go into "emergency override mode", which tries to get you
**	out of the quadrant as fast as possible.  However, if you
**	don't have enough fuel, or if you by chance run into something,
**	or some such thing, you blow up anyway.  Oh yeh, if you are
**	within two sectors of the star, there is nothing that can
**	be done for you.
**
**	When a star has gone supernova, the quadrant becomes uninhab-
**	itable for the rest of eternity, i.e., the game.  If you ever
**	try stopping in such a quadrant, you will go into emergency
**	override mode.
