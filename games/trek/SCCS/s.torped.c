/*
**  PHOTON TORPEDO CONTROL
**
**	Either one or three photon torpedoes are fired.  If three
**	are fired, it is called a "burst" and you also specify
**	a spread angle.
**
**	Torpedoes are never 100% accurate.  There is always a random
**	cludge factor in their course which is increased if you have
**	your shields up.  Hence, you will find that they are more
**	accurate at close range.  However, they have the advantage that
**	at long range they don't lose any of their power as phasers
**	do, i.e., a hit is a hit is a hit, by any other name.
**
**	When the course spreads too much, you get a misfire, and the
**	course is randomized even more.  You also have the chance that
**	the misfire damages your torpedo tubes.
