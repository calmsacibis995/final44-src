**  MOVE UNDER WARP POWER
**
**	This is both the "move" and the "ram" commands, differing
**	only in the flag 'fl'.  It is also used for automatic
**	emergency override mode, when 'fl' is < 0 and 'c' and 'd'
**	are the course and distance to be moved.  If 'fl' >= 0,
**	the course and distance are asked of the captain.
**
**	The guts of this routine are in the routine move(), which
**	is shared with impulse().  Also, the working part of this
**	routine is very small; the rest is to handle the slight chance
**	that you may be moving at some riduculous speed.  In that
**	case, there is code to handle time warps, etc.
