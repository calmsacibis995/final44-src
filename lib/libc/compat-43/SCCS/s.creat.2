Also see
.IR  chmod (2)
for the
construction of the

If the file did exist, its mode and owner remain unchanged
but it is truncated to 0 length.

The file is also opened for writing, and its file descriptor
is returned.

E 2
The

given is arbitrary; it need not allow
writing.
D 2
This feature is used by programs which deal with temporary
files of fixed names.
The creation is done with
a mode that forbids writing.
Then if a second
instance of the program attempts a
.I creat,
an error is
returned and the program knows that the name is unusable
for the moment.
