If

sends the signal to the sending process's process group.

E 7
The sending process and members of the process group must
D 5
have the same effective user ID, otherwise
this call is restricted to the super-user.
E 5
I 5
have the same effective user ID, or
the sender must be the super-user.
E 5
As a single special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent
D 2
to any process which is a descendant of the current process.  This
allows a command interpreter such as
.IR csh (1)
to restart set-user-id processes stopped from the keyboard with a stop signal.
.PP
The calls
.IP
.B "killpg(0, sig)"
.LP
and
.IP
.B "kill(0, sig)
.LP
have identical effects, sending the signal to all members of the
invoker's process group (including the process itself).
It is preferable to use the call involving
.I kill
in this case, as it is portable to other UNIX systems.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Zero is returned if the processes are sent the signals;
\-1 is returned if any process in the process group cannot be sent
the signal, or if there are no members in the process group.
.SH BUGS
The job control facilities are not available in standard version 7 UNIX.
These facilities are still under development and may change in future
releases of the system as better inter-process communication facilities
and support for virtual terminals become available.  The options and
specifications of this system call and even the call itself
are thus subject to change.
