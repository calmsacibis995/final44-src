.Sh DESCRIPTION
D 2
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by:
.Ef
.Xr setegid 2 .
E 2
I 2
The real and effective group ID's of the current process
are set to the arguments.
Unprivileged users may change the real group
ID to the effective group ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes.
E 2
.Pp
D 2
The effective group ID's of the
current process is set according to the
.Fa egid
argument.
The real group ID's of the
current process is checked to ensure that it matches
either the real or saved ID of the process
(thus ensuring that it can later be restored to the effective ID).
If
.Fa egid
is -1, the current gid is filled in by the system.
If
.Fa rgid
is -1, the check on real ID above is skipped.
Unprivileged users may change the effective user
ID to the real user ID or the saved user ID;
only the super-user may make other changes.
E 2
I 2
Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective
group ID forces the system to substitute the current
ID in place of the -1 parameter.
.Pp
The
D 5
.Fn setregid function was intended to allow swapping
E 5
I 5
.Fn setregid
function was intended to allow swapping
E 5
the real and effective group IDs
in set-group-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-group-ID value.
This function did not work correctly,
and its purpose is now better served by the use of the
.Fn setegid
function (see
.Xr setuid 2 ) .
.Pp
When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same value,
the standard
.Fn setgid
function is preferred.
E 2
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width [EPERM]
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id
D 2
or saved group-id was specified.
