E 7
D 2
The user ID (group ID) of the current process is set to
the argument.
Both the effective and the real ID are set.
These calls are only permitted to the super-user
or if the argument is the real or effective ID.
E 2

The real and effective user ID's of the
current process are set according to the arguments.

This interface is made obsolete by:

.Pp
The effective user ID's of the
current process is set according to the
.Fa euid
argument.
The real user ID's of the
current process is checked to ensure that it matches
either the real or saved ID of the process
(thus ensuring that it can later be restored to the effective ID).
E 9
I 9
The real and effective user IDs of the
current process are set according to the arguments.

E 7
D 3
Only the super-user may modify the real uid of
a process.  Users other than the super-user may
change the effective uid of a process only to the
real uid.
E 3

D 8
Unprivileged users may change the real user
ID to the effective user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes.
E 8
I 8
D 9
If
.Fa ruid
is -1, the check on real ID above is skipped.
Unprivileged users may change the effective user
ID to the real user ID or the saved user ID;
only the super-user may make other changes.
E 9
I 9
Unprivileged users may change the real user
ID to the effective user ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes.
.Pp
The

.Fn setreuid function has been used to swap the real and effective user IDs
E 10
I 10
.Fn setreuid
function has been used to swap the real and effective user IDs
E 10
in set-user-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the set-user-ID value.
This purpose is now better served by the use of the
.Fn seteuid
function (see
.Xr setuid 2 ) .
.Pp
When setting the real and effective user IDs to the same value,
the standard
.Fn setuid
function is preferred.
