To build this portably, try something like:

    make INC="-I../PORT/MACH/ -I../PORT/MACH/include" LIB=../PORT/MACH/libdb.a

where MACH is the machine, i.e. "sunos.4.1.1".

To run the tests, enter "sh run.test".  If your system dictionary isn't
in /usr/share/dict/words, edit run.test to reflect the correct place.

The script file consists of lines with a initial character which is
the "command" for that line.  Legal characters are as follows:

I 4
c: compare a record
	+ must be followed by [kK][dD]; the data value in the database
	  associated with the specified key is compared to the specified
	  data value.
E 4
I 2
e: echo a string
D 5
	+ writes out the rest of the line into the output file
E 5
I 5
	+ writes out the rest of the line into the output file; if the
	  last character is not a carriage-return, a newline is appended.
E 5
E 2
g: do a get command
	+ must be followed by [kK]
	+ writes out the retrieved data DBT.
p: do a put command
	+ must be followed by [kK][dD]
r: do a del command
	+ must be followed by [kK]
s: do a seq command
D 2
	+ writes out the retrieved key and data DBT's
E 2
I 2
	+ writes out the retrieved data DBT.
E 2
f: set the flags for the next command
	+ no value zero's the flags
D [file]: data file
	+ set the current data value to the contents of the file
d [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.
K [file]: key file
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the file
k [data]:
	+ set the current key value to the contents of the line.
I 6
o [r]: dump [reverse]
	+ dump the database out, if 'r' is set, in reverse order.
E 6

Options to dbtest are as follows:

I 7
	-f: Use the file argument as the database file.
E 7
	-i: Use the rest of the argument to set elements in the info
	    structure.  If the type is btree, then "-i cachesize=10240"
	    will set BTREEINFO.cachesize to 10240.
	-o: The rest of the argument is the output file instead of
	    using stdout.
D 3
	-t: Set the type of access, either "btree", "hash" or "recno".
E 3
I 3

Dbtest requires two arguments, the type of access "hash", "recno" or
"btree", and the script name.
