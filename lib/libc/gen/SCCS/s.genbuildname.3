.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Genbuildname
takes the name of a file and returns a pointer to a pathname
that should be used to create the file.
It is intended for use of programs such as the loader
to decide where to place binary output files.
The intent is to allow multiple architectures to be compiled
within a single source tree.
The destination directory for the binary is set in the predefined
.IR make (1)
variable
.SM OBJDIR.
