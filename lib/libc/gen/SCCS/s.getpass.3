getpass \- read a password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B char *getpass(prompt)
.B char *prompt;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getpass
reads a password from the file
.IR /dev/tty ,
or if that cannot be opened, from the standard input,
after prompting with the null-terminated string
.I prompt
and disabling echoing.
A pointer is returned to a null-terminated string
of at most 8 characters.

A calling process should zero the password as soon
as possible to avoid leaving the cleartext password
visible in the process' address space.
