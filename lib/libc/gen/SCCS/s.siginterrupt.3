.Fn siginterrupt "int sig" "int flag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn siginterrupt
function
E 2
is used to change the system call restart
behavior when a system call is interrupted by the specified signal.
If the flag is false (0), then system calls will be restarted if
they are interrupted by the specified signal
and no data has been transferred yet.
D 2
System call restart is the default behavior on 4.2 BSD.
.PP
If the flag is true (1), then restarting of system calls is disabled.
E 2
I 2
System call restart is the default behavior on
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
If the flag is true (1),
then restarting of system calls is disabled.
E 2
If a system call is interrupted by the specified signal
and no data has been transferred,
D 2
the system call will return -1 with errno set to EINTR.
E 2
I 2
the system call will return \-1 with the global variable
.Va errno
set to
.Dv EINTR . 
E 2
Interrupted system calls that have started transferring
data will return the amount of data actually transferred.
D 2
System call interrupt is the signal behavior found on 4.1 BSD
and AT&T System V UNIX systems.

E 2
I 2
System call interrupt is the signal behavior found on
.Bx 4.1
and
.At V
systems.
.Pp
Note that the new
.Bx 4.2
signal handling semantics are not
E 2
altered in any other way.
Most notably, signal handlers always remain installed until
explicitly changed by a subsequent

call, and the signal mask operates as documented in
D 2
.IR sigvec (2).
E 2
I 2
.Xr sigaction 2 .
E 2
Programs may switch between restartable and interruptible
system call operation as often as desired in the execution of a program.
