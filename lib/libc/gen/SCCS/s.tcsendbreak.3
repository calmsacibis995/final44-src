.LP
.B "Description"
.LP
If the terminal is using asynchronous serial data transmission, the
tcsendbreak() function shall cause transmission of a continuous stream of
zero-valued bits for a specific duration.  If duration is zero, it shall
cause transmission of zero-valued bits for at least 0.25 seconds, and not
more that 0.5 seconds.
.PP
The tcdrain() function shall wait until all output written to the object
referred to by fildes has been transmitted.
.PP
Upon successful completion, the tcflush() function shall have discarded
any data written to the object referred to by fildes but not transmitted,
or data received but not read, depending on the value of queue_selector:
.nf
    (1)  If queue_selector is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data received but
         not read.

    (2)  If queue_selector is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data written but
         not transmitted.

    (3)  If queue_selector is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both data
         received but not read, and data written but not transmitted.
.fi
.PP
The tcflow() function shall suspend transmission or reception of data on
the object referred to by fildes, depending on the value of action:
.nf
    (1)  If action is TCOOFF, it shall suspend output.

    (2)  If action is TCOON, it shall restart suspended output.

    (3)  If action is TCIOFF, the system shall transmit a STOP character,
         which is intended to cause the terminal device to stop
         transmitting data to the system.  (See the description of IXOFF
         in "Input Modes".)

    (4)  If action is TCION, the system shall transmit a START character,
         which is intended to cause the terminal device to start
         transmitting data to the system.  (See the description of IXOFF
         in "Input Modes".)
.fi
.LP
.B "Returns"
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.LP
.B "Errors"
.LP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcsendbreak() function
shall return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
.fi
.PP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcdrain() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINTR]       A signal interrupted the tcdrain() function.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
.fi
.PP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcflush() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINVAL]      The queue_selector argument is not a proper value.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
.fi
.PP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcflow() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINVAL]      The action argument is not a proper value.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tcdrain
function waits until all output written to the terminal referenced by
.Fa fd
has been transmitted to the terminal.
.Pp
The
.Nm tcflow
function suspends transmission of data to or the reception of data from
the terminal referenced by
.Fa fd
depending on the value of
.Fa action .
The value of
.Fa action
must be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "TCIOFF"
.It Fa TCOOFF
Suspend output.
.It Fa TCOON
Restart suspended output.
.It Fa TCIOFF
Transmit a STOP character, which is intended to cause the terminal to stop
transmitting data to the system.
(See the description of IXOFF in the
.Ql Input Modes
section of
.Xr termios 4 ).
.It Fa TCION
Transmit a START character, which is intended to cause the terminal to start
transmitting data to the system.
(See the description of IXOFF in the
.Ql Input Modes
section of
.Xr termios 4 ).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm tcflush
function discards any data written to the terminal referenced by
.Fa fd
which has not been transmitted to the terminal, or any data received
from the terminal but not yet read, depending on the value of
.Fa action .
The value of
.Fa action
must be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "TCIOFLUSH"
.It Fa TCIFLUSH
Flush data received but not read.
.It Fa TCOFLUSH
Flush data written but not transmitted.
.It Fa TCIOFLUSH
Flush both data received but not read and data written but not transmitted.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm tcsendbreak
function transmits a continuous stream of zero-valued bits for four-tenths
of a second to the terminal referenced by
.Fa fd .
The
.Fa len
parameter is ignored in this implementation.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, all of these functions return a value of zero.
.Sh ERRORS
If any error occurs, a value of -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa action
argument is not a proper value.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
The file associated with
.Fa fd
is not a terminal.
.It Bq Er EINTR
A signal interrupted the
.Nm tcdrain
function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tcsetattr 3 ,
.Xr termios 4
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm tcsendbreak ,
.Nm tcdrain ,
.Nm tcflush
and
.Nm tcflow
functions are expected to be compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-88
specification.
