The following interfaces are provided for getting and setting the values
of the input and output baud rates in the termios structure.  The effects
on the terminal device described below do not become effective until the
tcsetattr() function is successfully called, and not all errors are
detected until tcsetattr() is called as well.
.PP
The input and output baud rates are represented in the termios structure.
The type speed_t is an unsigned integer.  The value of the integer
corresponds directly to the baud rate being represented, however,
the following symbolic values are defined.

Both cfsetispeed() and cfsetospeed() return a value of zero if successful
and -1 to indicate an error.

The cfmakeraw() function shall set the flags stored in the termios
structure in a state that disables all input and output processing,
giving a "raw" i/o path.  Note that there is no "unraw" function.  This
is because there are a variety of processing options that could
be re-enabled and the correct method is for an application to
snapshot the current terminal state using tcgetattr(), setting
raw mode with cfmakeraw() and the subsequent tcsetattr(), and then
to revert to the previous terminal state with another tcsetattr()
using the saved terminal state.

Unless otherwise noted for a specific command, these functions are restricted
from use by background processes.
Attempts to perform these operations shall cause the process group to be sent

.fi
.LP
.B "Description"
.LP
The tcgetattr() function shall get the parameters associated with the
object referred to by fildes and store them in the termios structure
referenced by termios_p.  This function is allowed from a background
process; however, the terminal attributes may be subsequently changed by
a foreground process.  If the terminal device supports different input
and output baud rates, the baud rates stored in the termios structure
returned by tcgetattr() shall reflect the actual baud rates, even if they
are equal.  If differing baud rates are not supported, the rate returned
as the output baud rate shall be the actual baud rate.  The rate returned
as the input baud rate shall be either the number zero or the output rate.
.PP
The tcsetattr() function shall set the parameters associated with the
terminal (unless support is required from the underlying hardware that is
not available) from the termios structure referenced by termios_p as
follows:
.nf
    (1)  If optional_actions is TCSANOW, the change shall occur
         immediately.

    (2)  If optional_actions is TCSADRAIN, the change shall occur after
         all output written to fildes has been transmitted.  This
         function should be used when changing parameters that affect
         output.

    (3)  If optional_actions is TCSAFLUSH, the change shall occur after
         all output written to the object referred to by fildes has been
         transmitted, and all input that has been received but not read
         shall be discarded before the change is made.

    (4)  If TCSASOFT is or'ed in with the optional_actions, then the
	  value of the c_cflag and the speed will be ignored.
.fi
.PP
The symbolic constants for the values of optional_actions are defined in
<termios.h>.
.PP
The zero baud rate, B0, is used to terminate the connection.  If B0 is
specified as the output speed when tcsetattr() is called, the modem
control lines shall no longer be asserted.  Normally, this will
disconnect the line.
.PP
If the input baud rate is equal to zero (the number) in the termios
structure when tcsetattr() is called, the input baud rate will be changed
by tcsetattr() to the same value as that specified by the value of the
output baud rate, exactly as if the input rate had been set to the output
rate by cfsetispeed().  This usage of zero is obsolescent.
.PP
If an attempt is made using tcsetattr() to set an unsupported baud rate,
baud rates where the input and output baud rates differ and the hardware
does not support that combination, or other features not supported by the
hardware, but if tcsetattr() was able to perform some of the requested
actions, it shall return success.  It shall set all the attributes that
the implementation does support as requested and leave all the attributes
not supported by the hardware unchanged.  If no part of the request can
be honored, it shall return -1 and set errno to [EINVAL].  If the input
and output baud rates differ and are a combination that is not supported,
neither baud rate is changed.  A subsequent call to tcgetattr() shall
return the actual state of the terminal device [reflecting both the
changes made and not made in the previous tcsetattr() call].  The
tcsetattr() function shall not change the values in the termios structure
whether or not it actually accepts them.
.PP
The termios structure may have additional fields not defined by this
standard.  The effect of the tcsetattr() function is undefined if the
value of the termios structure pointed to by termios_p was not derived
from the result of a call to tcgetattr() on fildes; a Strictly Conforming
POSIX.1 Application shall modify only fields and flags defined by this
standard between the call to tcgetattr() and tcsetattr(), leaving all
other fields and flags unmodified.
.PP
.B "Returns"
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero is returned.  Otherwise, a
value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
.LP
.B "Errors"
.LP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcgetattr() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
.fi
.PP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcsetattr() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINTR]       A signal interrupted the tcsetattr() function.

   [EINVAL]      The optional_actions argument is not a proper value, or
                 an attempt was made to change an attribute represented
                 in the termios structure to an unsupported value.

   [ENOTTY]      The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.
.fi

.Pp
In all the functions, although
.Fa fd
is an open file descriptor, the functions affect the underlying terminal
file, not just the open file description associated with the particular
file descriptor.
.Pp
The
.Nm cfmakeraw
function sets the flags stored in the termios structure to a state disabling
all input and output processing, giving a
.Dq raw I/O path.
It should be noted that there is no function to reverse this effect.
This is because there are a variety of processing options that could be
re-enabled and the correct method is for an application to snapshot the
current terminal state using the function
.Nm tcgetattr ,
setting raw mode with
.Nm cfmakeraw
and the subsequent
.Nm tcsetattr ,
and then using another
.Nm tcsetattr
with the saved state to revert to the previous terminal state.
.Pp
The
.Nm tcgetattr
function copies the parameters associated with the terminal referenced
by
.Fa fd
in the termios structure referenced by
.Fa tp .
This function is allowed from a background process, however, the terminal
attributes may be subsequently changed by a foreground process.
.Pp
The
.Nm tcsetattr
function sets the parameters associated with the terminal from the
termios structure referenced by
.Fa tp .
The
.Fa action
field is created by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values, as specified in the include file
.Aq Pa termios.h .
.Bl -tag -width "TCSADRAIN"
.It Fa TCSANOW
The change occurs immediately.
.It Fa TCSADRAIN
The change occurs after all output written to
.Fa fd
has been transmitted to the terminal.
This value of
.Fa action
should be used when changing parameters that affect output.
.It Fa TCSAFLUSH
The change occurs after all output written to
.Fa fd
D 5
has been transmitted to the terminal
E 5
I 5
has been transmitted to the terminal.
E 5
Additionally, any input that has been received but not read is discarded.
.It Fa TCSASOFT
If this value is
.Em or Ns 'ed
into the
.Fa action
value, the values of the
.Em c_cflag ,
.Em c_ispeed ,
and
.Em c_ospeed
fields are ignored.
.El
.Pp
The 0 baud rate is used to terminate the connection.
If 0 is specified as the output speed to the function
.Nm tcsetattr ,
modem control will no longer be asserted on the terminal, disconnecting
the terminal.
.Pp
If zero is specified as the input speed to the function
.Nm tcsetattr ,
the input baud rate will be set to the same value as that specified by
the output baud rate.
.Pp
If
.Nm tcsetattr
D 5
is unable able to make any of the requested changes, it returns -1 and
E 5
I 5
is unable to make any of the requested changes, it returns -1 and
E 5
sets errno.
Otherwise, it makes all of the requested changes it can.
If the specified input and output baud rates differ and are a combination
that is not supported, neither baud rate is changed.
.Pp
Upon successful completion, the functions
.Nm tcgetattr
and
.Nm tcsetattr
return a value of 0.
Otherwise, they
return -1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument to
.Nm tcgetattr
or
.Nm tcsetattr
was not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINTR
The
.Nm tcsetattr
function was interrupted by a signal.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa action
argument to the
.Nm tcsetattr
function was not valid, or an attempt was made to change an attribute
represented in the termios structure to an unsupported value.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
The file associated with the
.Fa fd
argument to
.Nm tcgetattr
or
.Nm tcsetattr
is not a terminal.
