.B "Description"
.LP
If the process has a controlling terminal, the tcsetpgrp() function
shall set the foreground process group ID associated with the
terminal to pgrp_id.  The file associated with fildes must be the
controlling terminal of the calling process and the controlling
terminal must be currently associated with the session of the
calling process.  The value of pgrp_id must match a process group
ID of a process in the same session as the calling process.
.LP
.B "Returns"
.LP
Upon successful completion, tcsetpgrp() returns a value of zero.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
error.
.LP
.B "Errors"
.LP
If any of the following conditions occur, the tcsetpgrp() function shall
return -1 and set errno to the corresponding value:
.nf
   [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

   [EINVAL]      The value of the pgrp_id argument is a value not
                 supported by the implementation.

   [ENOSYS]      The tcsetpgrp() function is not supported in this
                 implementation.

   [ENOTTY]      The calling process does not have a controlling
                 terminal, or the file is not the controlling terminal,
                 or the controlling terminal is no longer associated with
                 the session of the calling process.

   [EPERM]       The value of pgrp_id is a value supported by the
                 implementation but does not match the process group ID
                 of a process in the same session as the calling process.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the process has a controlling terminal, the
.Nm tcsetpgrp
function sets the foreground process group ID associated with the
terminal device to
.Fa pgrp_id .
The terminal device associated with
.Fa fd
must be the controlling terminal of the calling process and the
controlling terminal must be currently associated with the session
of the calling process.
The value of
.Fa pgrp_id
must be the same as the process group ID of a process in the same
session as the calling process.
.Pp
Upon successful completion,
.Nm tcsetpgrp
returns a value of zero.
.Sh ERRORS
If an error occurs,
.Nm tcgetpgrp
returns -1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid value of
.Fa pgrp_id
was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file
represented by
.Fa fd
is not the controlling terminal, or the controlling terminal is no
longer associated with the session of the calling process.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa pgrp_id
argument does not match the process group ID of a process in the same
session as the calling process.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm tcsetpgprp
function is expected to be compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-88
specification.
