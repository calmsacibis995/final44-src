     *	Fraction of text space to allocate for from hash buckets.
     *	The value of HASHFRACTION is based on the minimum number of bytes
     *	of separation between two subroutine call points in the object code.
     *	Given MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION bytes of separation the value of
     *	HASHFRACTION is calculated as:
     *
     *		HASHFRACTION = MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION / (2 * sizeof(short) - 1);

     *
     *		calls	$0,(r0)
     *		calls	$0,(r0)
     *
     *	which is separated by only three bytes, thus HASHFRACTION is 
     *	calculated as:
     *
     *		HASHFRACTION = 3 / (2 * 2 - 1) = 1

     *	Note that the division above rounds down, thus if MIN_SUBR_FRACTION
