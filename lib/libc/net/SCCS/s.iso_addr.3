.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <netiso/iso.h>
.Ft struct iso_addr *
.Fn iso_addr "char *cp"
.Ft char *
.Fn iso_ntoa "struct iso_addr *isoa"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The routine
.Fn iso_addr
interprets character strings representing
.Tn OSI
addresses, returning binary information suitable
for use in system calls.
The routine
.Fn iso_ntoa
takes
.Tn OSI
addresses and returns
.Tn ASCII
strings representing NSAPs (network service
access points) in a
notation inverse to that accepted by 
.Fn iso_addr .
.Pp
Unfortunately, no universal standard exists for representing
.Tn OSI
network addresses.
.Pp
The format employed by
.Fn iso_addr
is a sequence of hexadecimal
.Dq digits
(optionally separated by periods),
of the form:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
<hex digits>.<hex digits>.<hex digits>
.Ed
.Pp
Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents a byte
with the leading digit indicating the higher-ordered bits.
A period following an even number of bytes has no
D 3
effect (but may be used to increase legitibility).
E 3
I 3
effect (but may be used to increase legibility).
E 3
A period following an odd number of bytes has the
D 3
effective of filling the byte of address being translated
E 3
I 3
effect of causing the byte of address being translated
E 3
to have its higher order bits filled with zeros.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn iso_ntoa
always returns a null terminated string.
.Fn iso_addr
always returns a pointer to a struct iso_addr.

E 3
The function
.Fn iso_addr
should diagnose improperly formed input, and there should be an unambiguous
way to recognize this.
