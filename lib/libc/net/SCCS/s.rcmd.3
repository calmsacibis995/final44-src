The

a remote machine using an authentication scheme based
on reserved port numbers.

The

The

returning \-1 if the host does not exist.
Otherwise
D 12

E 12
I 12

E 12
is set to the standard name of the host

E 12
I 12
a socket in the Internet domain of type

is returned to the caller, and given to the remote

E 12
and
D 12

If
D 12
.I fd2p
E 12
I 12
.Fa fd2p
E 12
is non-zero, then an auxiliary channel to a control
process will be set up, and a descriptor for it will be placed
in
D 12
.IR *fd2p .
E 12
I 12
.Fa *fd2p .
E 12
The control process will return diagnostic
output from the command (unit 2) on this channel, and will also

accept bytes on this channel as being UNIX signal numbers, to be

I 12

If

.I fd2p
E 12
I 12
.Fa fd2p
E 12
is 0, then the 
D 12

E 12
(unit 2 of the remote
command) will be made the same as the

.B stdout
E 12
I 12

and no
provision is made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process,
although you may be able to get its attention by using out-of-band data.

The

.Fn rresvport
function is used to obtain a socket with a privileged

address bound to it.  This socket is suitable for use
by

and sevral other routines.  Privileged addresses consist
E 3
I 3
D 8
and several other routines.  Privileged addresses consist
E 3
of a port in the range 0 to 1023.  Only the super-user

and several other routines.  Privileged Internet ports are those

I 12
.Fn rcmd
and several other functions.  Privileged Internet ports are those

If this file does not exist, is not a regular file, is owned by anyone

than the owner, the check automatically fails.
Zero is returned if the machine name is listed in the

The
.Fn iruserok
function is strongly preferred for security reasons.
It requires trusting the local DNS at most, while the
.Fn ruserok
function requires trusting the entire DNS, which can be spoofed.
