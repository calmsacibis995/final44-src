This interface is obsoleted by fgets(3).
As it makes no effort to avoid overwriting its buffer, 
it's a clear security problem.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gets
reads a string into
.I s
from the standard input stream
D 2
.B stdin.
E 2
I 2
.BR stdin .
E 2
The string is terminated by a newline
character, which is replaced in
.I s
by a null character.
.I Gets
returns its argument.
E 5
I 5
The
.I gets
function reads characters from the input stream pointed to by
.IR stdin ,
into the array pointed to by
.IR s ,
until end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read.
Any newline character is discarded, and a null character is written
immediately after the last character read into the array.
E 5
.PP
D 5
.I Fgets
reads 
.IR n \-1
D 3
characters, or up to a newline
E 3
I 3
characters, or up through a newline
E 3
character, whichever comes first,
from the
.I stream
into the string
.IR s .
The last character read into
E 5
I 5
The
.I gets
function returns
E 5
.I s
D 5
is followed by a null character.
.I Fgets
returns its first argument.
E 5
I 5
if successful.
If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into
the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a null
pointer is returned.
If a read error occurrs during the operation, the array contents
are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.

keeps it,
