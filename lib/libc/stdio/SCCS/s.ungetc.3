.Nd un-get character from input stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <stdio.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ungetc "int c" "FILE *stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ungetc
function pushes the character
.Fa c
(converted to an unsigned char)
back onto the input stream pointed to by
.Fa stream .
The pushed-backed characters will be returned by subsequent reads on the
stream (in reverse order).
A successful intervening call, using the same stream, to one of the file
positioning functions
.Po
.Xr fseek 3 ,
.Xr fsetpos 3 ,
or
.Xr rewind 3
.Pc
will discard the pushed back characters.
.Pp
One character of push-back is guaranteed,
but as long as there is
E 7
sufficient memory, an effectively infinite amount of pushback is allowed.
D 7
Attempts to push
.B EOF
are rejected.

If a character is successfully pushed-back,
the end-of-file indicator for the stream is cleared.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The

function
E 7
returns
D 7
.SM
.B EOF
D 5
if it can't push a character back.
E 5
I 5
if it cannot push back the given character for any reason
(this includes attempts to push
.BR EOF ).
E 7
I 7
the character pushed-back after the conversion, or
.Dv EOF
if the operation fails.
If the value of the argument
.Fa c
character equals
.Dv EOF ,
the operation will fail and the stream will remain unchanged.
