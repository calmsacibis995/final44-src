E 4
The
D 4
.I bsearch
E 4
I 4
.Fn bsearch
E 4
function searches an array of
D 4
.I nmemb
E 4
I 4
.Fa nmemb
E 4
D 9
objects, the inital member of which is 
E 9
I 9
objects, the initial member of which is 
E 9
pointed to by
D 4
.IR base ,
E 4
I 4
.Fa base ,
E 4
for a member that matches the object pointed to by
D 4
.IR key .
E 4
I 4
.Fa key .
E 4
The size of each member of the array is specified by 
D 4
.I size .
.PP
E 4
I 4
.Fa size .
.Pp
E 4
The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according
to the comparison function referenced by
D 4
.IR compar .
.I Compar
is called with two arguments that point to the
.I key
object and to an array member, in that order, and must return an integer

I 4
.Fa compar .
The
.Fa compar
routine
D 8
is expected to have two
E 8
I 8
is expected to have
E 8
two arguments which point to the
.Fa key
object and to an array member, in that order, and should return an integer
E 4
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
D 4
.I key
object is considered, respectively, to be less than, equal to, or to
E 4
I 4
.Fa key
object is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be
E 4
greater than the array member.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
E 4
The
D 4
.I bsearch
E 4
I 4
.Fn bsearch
E 4
function returns a pointer to a matching member of the array, or a null
pointer if no match is found.
If two members compare as equal, which member is matched is unspecified.
