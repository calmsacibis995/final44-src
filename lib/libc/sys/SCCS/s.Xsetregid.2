.SH DESCRIPTION
The real and effective group ID's of the current process
are set to the arguments.
D 2
Only the super-user may change the real group ID
of a process.  Unpriviledged users may change the
effective group ID to the real group ID, but to
no other.
E 2
I 2
Unprivileged users may change the real group
ID to the effective group ID and vice-versa; only the super-user may
make other changes.
E 2
.PP
Supplying a value of \-1 for either the real or effective
group ID forces the system to substitute the current
ID in place of the \-1 parameter.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of \-1 is returned and \fIerrno\fP is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS
.TP 15
[EPERM]
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective group-id to the real group-id
was specified.
