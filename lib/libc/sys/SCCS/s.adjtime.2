The time is maintained by incrementing it with a machine-dependent tick
every clock interrupt.
E 2
If \fIdelta\fP is negative, the clock is
E 7
I 7
.Fa delta .
If
.Fa delta
is negative, the clock is

slowed down by incrementing it in smaller ticks until
the correction is made.
If \fIdelta\fP is positive, a larger tick
E 2
I 2
slowed down by incrementing it more slowly than normal until
the correction is complete.
D 7
If \fIdelta\fP is positive, a larger increment than normal
E 7
I 7
If
.Fa delta
is positive, a larger increment than normal
E 7
E 2
is used.
I 2
The skew used to perform the correction is generally a fraction of one percent.
E 2
Thus, the time is always
a monotonically increasing function.
D 7
A time correction from an earlier call to \fIadjtime\fP
may not be finished when \fIadjtime\fP is called again.
If \fIolddelta\fP is non-zero,

This call can be used in time servers that synchronize the clocks
E 2
I 2
This call may be used by time servers that synchronize the clocks

of computers in a local area network.
Such time servers would slow down the clocks of some machines
and speed up the clocks of others to bring them to the average network time.

.SH NOTES
On a VAX the time is incremented 
in 10ms ticks.
When \fIadjtime\fP is called with an argument other than zero,
ticks of 9ms or 11ms are used until the time is corrected.
A \fIdelta\fP of less than 1ms would have no effect.

E 7
A return value of 0 indicates that the call succeeded.
D 7
A return value of \-1 indicates that an error occurred, and in this
case an error code is stored in the global variable \fIerrno\fP.
.SH "ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in \fIerrno\fP:
.TP 15
[EFAULT]

I 7
A return value of -1 indicates that an error occurred, and in this
case an error code is stored in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Adjtime
