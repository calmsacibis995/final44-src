.Fd #include <unistd.h>

.Fn fork void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Fork
E 7
D 2
and
.IR vfork (2)
are the only ways new processes are created.
With
.I fork ,
the new process's core image is a copy of
that of the caller of
.IR fork .
The only distinction
is the fact
that the value returned in the old (parent) process
contains the process ID
of the new (child) process,
while the value returned in the child is 0.
Process ID's range from 1 to 30,000.
This process ID is used by
.IR wait (2).
.PP
Files open before the fork
are shared, and have a common read-write pointer.
In particular,
this is the way that standard input and output
files are passed and also how
pipes are set up.
.PP
.I Vfork
is the most efficient way of creating a new process
when the fork is to be followed shortly by an exec,
but is not suitable when the fork is not to be followed
by an exec.

causes creation of a new process.
The new process (child process) is an exact copy of the
D 7
calling process except for the following:
.in +5n
.sp
E 7
I 7
calling process (parent process) except for the following:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
E 7
The child process has a unique process ID.
D 7
.sp
The child process has a different parent process ID (i.e.,
the process ID of the parent process).
.sp
E 7
I 7
.It
The child process has a different parent
process ID (i.e., the process ID of the parent process).
.It
E 7
The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors.
These descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so that,
for instance, file pointers in file objects are shared between
D 5
the child and the parent, so that a
E 5
I 5
the child and the parent, so that an

.Xr read
E 7
or
D 7
.I write
E 7
I 7

by the parent.
This descriptor copying is also used by the shell to
establish standard input and output for newly created processes
as well as to set up pipes.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn fork

E 7
of 0 to the child process and returns the process ID of the child
D 7
process to the parent process.  Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned
E 7
I 7
process to the parent process.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned
E 7
to the parent process, no child process is created, and the global
D 7
variable \fIerrno\fP is set to indicate the error.

there is inadequate swap space,
the user is not super-user and has too many processes,
or the system's process table is full.
Only the super-user can take the last process-table slot.
