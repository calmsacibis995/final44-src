.Fn mkfifo "const char *path" "mode_t mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Mkfifo
E 3
creates a new fifo file with name
D 3
.IR path .
The mode of the new file
is initialized from
.IR mode .
(The protection part of the mode
is modified by the process's mode mask; see
.IR umask (2)).
.PP
E 3
I 3
.Fa path .
The access permissions are
specified by
.Fa mode
and restricted by the
.Xr umask 2
of the calling process.
.Pp
E 3
The fifo's owner ID is set to the process's effective user ID.
The fifo's group ID is set to that of the parent directory in
which it is created.
D 3
.PP
The low-order 9 bits of mode are modified by the process's
file mode creation mask: all bits set in the process's file mode
creation mask are cleared.  See
.IR umask (2).
