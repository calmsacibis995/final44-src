.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ptrace
provides a means by which a parent process
may control the execution of a child process,
and examine and change its core image.
Its primary use is for the implementation of breakpoint debugging.
There are four arguments whose interpretation
depends on a
.I request
argument.
Generally,
.I pid
is the process ID of the traced process,
which must be a child (no more distant descendant)
of the tracing process.
A process being traced
D 2
behaves normally until it encounters some signal whether internally generated
like `illegal instruction' or externally generated like `interrupt.'
E 2
I 2
behaves normally until it encounters some signal
whether internally generated
like \*(lqillegal instruction\*(rq or externally
generated like \*(lqinterrupt\*(rq.
E 2
See
D 2
.IR signal (2)
E 2
I 2
.IR sigvec (2)
E 2
for the list.
Then the traced process enters a stopped state
and its parent is notified via
.IR  wait (2).
When the child is in the stopped state,
its core image can be examined and modified
using
.IR ptrace .
If desired, another
.I ptrace
request can then cause the child either to terminate
or to continue, possibly ignoring the signal.
.PP
The value of the
.I request
argument determines the precise
action of the call:
.TP 4
D 3
0
E 3
I 3
PT_TRACE_ME
E 3
This request is the only one used by the child process;
it declares that the process is to be traced by its parent.
All the other arguments are ignored.
Peculiar results will ensue
if the parent does not expect to trace the child.
.TP 4
D 3

E 3
I 3
PT_READ_I, PT_READ_D
E 3
The
word in the child process's address space
at
.I addr
is returned.
D 2
If I and D space are separated, request 1 indicates I space,
E 2
I 2
If I and D space are separated (e.g. historically
D 3
on a pdp-11), request 1 indicates I space,
E 2
2 D space.
E 3
I 3
on a pdp-11), request PT_READ_I indicates I space,
PT_READ_D D space.
E 3
.I Addr
D 4
must be even.
E 4
I 4
must be even on some machines.
E 4
The child must be stopped.
The input
.I data
is ignored.
.TP 4
D 3
3
E 3
I 3
PT_READ_U
E 3
The word
of the system's per-process data area corresponding to
.I addr
is returned.
.I Addr
D 4
must be even and less than 512.
E 4
I 4
must be even on some machines and less than 512.
E 4
This space contains the registers and other information about
the process;
its layout corresponds to the
.I user
structure in the system.
.TP 4
D 3
4,5
E 3
I 3
PT_WRITE_I, PT_WRITE_D
E 3
The
given
.I data
is written at the word in the process's address space corresponding to
.I addr,
D 4
which must be even.
E 4
I 4
which must be even on some machines.
E 4
No useful value is returned.
D 3
If I and D space are separated, request 4 indicates I space, 
5 D space.
E 3
I 3
If I and D space are separated, request PT_WRITE_I indicates I space, 
PT_WRITE_D D space.
E 3
Attempts to write in pure procedure
fail if another process is executing the same file.
.TP 4
D 3
6
E 3
I 3
PT_WRITE_U
E 3
The process's system data is written,
D 3
as it is read with request 3.
E 3
I 3
as it is read with request PT_READ_U.
E 3
Only a few locations can be written in this way:
the general registers,
the floating point status and registers,
and certain bits of the processor status word.
.TP 4
D 3
7
E 3
I 3
PT_CONTINUE
E 3
The
.I data
argument is taken as a signal number
and the child's execution continues
at location
.I addr
as if it had incurred that signal.
Normally the signal number will be
either 0 to indicate that the signal that caused the stop
should be ignored,
or that value fetched out of the
process's image indicating which signal caused
the stop.
If
.I addr
is (int *)1 then execution continues from where it stopped.
.TP 4
D 3
8
E 3
I 3
PT_KILL
E 3
The traced process terminates.
.TP 4
D 3
9
Execution continues as in request 7;
E 3
I 3
PT_STEP
Execution continues as in request PT_CONTINUE;
E 3
however, as soon as possible after execution of at least one instruction,
execution stops again.
The signal number from the stop is
SIGTRAP.
D 2
(On the PDP-11 and VAX-11 the T-bit is used and just one instruction
is executed;
on the Interdata the stop does not take place
until a store instruction is executed.)
E 2
I 2
(On the VAX-11 the T-bit is used and just one instruction
is executed.)
E 2
This is part of the mechanism for implementing breakpoints.
I 9
.TP 4
PT_ATTACH
The process indicated by 
.I pid
is re-parented to the calling process and delivered a SIGSTOP signal.
The child process may then be traced by the parent, as in PT_TRACE_ME.
A process already being traced cannot be attached to.

If the calling process is not owned by root,
it must have the same real user ID as the target process and
D 11
not have used set user or group priviledges.
E 11
I 11
not have used set user or group privileges.
E 11
.TP 4
PT_DETACH
The process indicated by
.I pid
is detached from tracing and continues its execution.
The process, which must be a traced child of the caller, is re-parented
with the parent it had before tracing began.  The
.I data
and
.I addr
arguments behave as in PT_CONTINUE.
E 9
.PP
As indicated,
these calls
D 3
(except for request 0)
E 3
I 3
(except for request PT_TRACE_ME)
E 3
can be used only when the subject process has stopped.
The
.I wait
call is used to determine
when a process stops;
D 2
in such a case the `termination' status
E 2
I 2
in such a case the \*(lqtermination\*(rq status
E 2
returned by
.I wait
has the value 0177 to indicate stoppage rather
than genuine termination.
.PP
To forestall possible fraud,
.I ptrace
D 2
inhibits the set-user-id facility
E 2

E 2
on subsequent
D 2

E 2
calls.
If a traced process calls
D 2
.I exec,
E 2
I 2
.IR execve ,
E 2
it will stop before executing the first instruction of the new image
showing signal SIGTRAP.
.PP
D 2
On the Interdata 8/32,
`word' means a 32-bit word and `even' means 0 mod 4.
On a VAX-11, `word' also means a 32-bit integer, but the `even' restriction
does not apply.
E 2
I 2
On a VAX-11, \*(lqword\*(rq also means a 32-bit integer,
but the \*(lqeven\*(rq
restriction does not apply.
.SH "RETURN VALUE
A 0 value is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call fails
then a \-1 is returned and the global variable \fIerrno\fP is
set to indicate the error.

PT_STEP is not supported on all architectures.
For example, the SPARC architecture does not have a trace bit, which
complicates single instruction stepping.
Debuggers and the like can emulate PT_STEP by placing breakpoints at
all possible locations of the next instruction.
