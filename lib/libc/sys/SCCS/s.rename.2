.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Rename
E 8
causes the link named
D 8
.I from
E 8
I 8
.Fa from
E 8
to be renamed as
D 8
.IR to .
E 8
I 8
.Fa to .
E 8
If 
D 8
.I to
exists, then it is first removed.
E 8
I 8
.Fa to
exists, it is first removed.
E 8
Both 
D 8
.I from
E 8
I 8
.Fa from
E 8
and
D 8
.I to
E 8
I 8
.Fa to
E 8
must be of the same type (that is, both directories or both
non-directories), and must reside on the same file system.
D 8
.PP
.I Rename
E 8
I 8

.Fn Rename
E 8
guarantees that an instance of
D 8
.I to

E 8
will always exist, even if the system should crash in
the middle of the operation.

If the final component of
D 8
.I from
E 8
I 8
.Fa from
E 8
is a symbolic link,
the symbolic link is renamed,
not the file or directory to which it points.

.SH CAVEAT
E 8
I 8
.Sh CAVEAT
E 8
The system can deadlock if a loop in the file system graph is present.
D 8
This loop takes the form of an entry in directory \*(lqa\*(rq,
say \*(lqa/foo\*(rq,
being a hard link to directory \*(lqb\*(rq, and an entry in
directory \*(lqb\*(rq, say \*(lqb/bar\*(rq, being a hard link
to directory \*(lqa\*(rq.
E 8
I 8
This loop takes the form of an entry in directory
.Ql Pa a ,
say
.Ql Pa a/foo ,
being a hard link to directory
.Ql Pa b ,
and an entry in
directory
.Ql Pa b ,
say
.Ql Pa b/bar ,
being a hard link
to directory
.Ql Pa a .
E 8
When such a loop exists and two separate processes attempt to
D 8
perform \*(lqrename a/foo b/bar\*(rq and \*(lqrename b/bar a/foo\*(rq,
E 8
I 8
perform
.Ql rename a/foo b/bar
and
.Ql rename b/bar a/foo ,
E 8
respectively, 
the system may deadlock attempting to lock
both directories for modification.
Hard links to directories should be
replaced by symbolic links by the system administrator.
