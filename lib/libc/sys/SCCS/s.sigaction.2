E 2
The system defines a set of signals that may be delivered to a process.
D 6
Signal delivery resembles the occurence of a hardware interrupt:
E 6
I 6
Signal delivery resembles the occurrence of a hardware interrupt:
E 6
the signal is blocked from further occurrence, the current process 
context is saved, and a new one is built.  A process may specify a
D 2
.I handler
E 2
I 2
.Em handler
E 2
to which a signal is delivered, or specify that a signal is to be 
D 2
.IR ignored .
E 2
I 2
.Em ignored .
E 2
A process may also specify that a default action is to be taken
by the system when a signal occurs.
A signal may also be
D 2
.IR blocked ,
E 2
I 2
.Em blocked ,
E 2
in which case its delivery is postponed until it is
D 2
.IR unblocked .
E 2
I 2
.Em unblocked .
E 2
The action to be taken on delivery is determined at the time
of delivery.
Normally, signal handlers execute on the current stack
of the process.  This may be changed, on a per-handler basis,
so that signals are taken on a special
D 2
.IR "signal stack" .
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Em "signal stack" .
.Pp
E 2
Signal routines execute with the signal that caused their
invocation
D 2
.IR blocked ,
E 2
I 2
.Em blocked ,
E 2
but other signals may yet occur.
A global 
D 2
.I "signal mask"
E 2
I 2
.Em "signal mask"
E 2
defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery
to a process.  The signal mask for a process is initialized
from that of its parent (normally empty).  It
may be changed with a
D 2
.IR sigprocmask (2)
E 2
I 2
.Xr sigprocmask 2
E 2
call, or when a signal is delivered to the process.
D 2
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Pp
E 2
When a signal
condition arises for a process, the signal is added to a set of
signals pending for the process.
If the signal is not currently
D 2
.I blocked
E 2
I 2
.Em blocked
E 2
by the process then it is delivered to the process.
Signals may be delivered any time a process enters the operating system
(e.g., during a system call, page fault or trap, or clock interrupt).
If multiple signals are ready to be delivered at the same time,
any signals that could be caused by traps are delivered first.
Additional signals may be processed at the same time, with each
appearing to interrupt the handlers for the previous signals
before their first instructions.
The set of pending signals is returned by the
D 2
.IR sigpending (2)
E 2
I 2
.Xr sigpending 2
E 2
function.
When a caught signal
is delivered, the current state of the process is saved,
a new signal mask is calculated (as described below), 
and the signal handler is invoked.  The call to the handler
is arranged so that if the signal handling routine returns
normally the process will resume execution in the context
from before the signal's delivery.
If the process wishes to resume in a different context, then it
must arrange to restore the previous context itself.
D 2
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Pp
E 2
When a signal is delivered to a process a new signal mask is
installed for the duration of the process' signal handler
(or until a
D 2
.I sigprocmask
E 2
I 2
.Xr sigprocmask
E 2
call is made).
This mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal mask set,
the signal to be delivered, and 
the signal mask associated with the handler to be invoked.
D 2
.PP
.I Sigaction
E 2
I 2
.Pp
.Fn Sigaction
E 2
assigns an action for a specific signal.
If
D 2
.I act
E 2
I 2
.Fa act
E 2
is non-zero, it
D 2
specifies an action (SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or a handler routine) and mask
E 2
I 2
specifies an action
.Pf ( Dv SIG_DFL ,
.Dv SIG_IGN ,
or a handler routine) and mask
E 2
to be used when delivering the specified signal.
If 
D 2
.I oact
E 2
I 2
.Fa oact
E 2
is non-zero, the previous handling information for the signal
is returned to the user.
D 2
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Pp
E 2
Once a signal handler is installed, it remains installed
until another
D 2
.I sigaction
E 2
I 2
.Fn sigaction
E 2
call is made, or an 
D 2
.IR execve (2)
E 2
I 2
.Xr execve 2
E 2
is performed.
D 2
The default action for a signal may be reinstated by setting
.I sa_handler
to SIG_DFL.
The default actions are termination, possibly with a core image;
E 2
I 2
A signal-specific default action may be reset by
setting
.Fa sa_handler
to
.Dv SIG_DFL .
The defaults are process termination, possibly with core dump;
E 2
no action; stopping the process; or continuing the process.
See the signal list below for each signal's default action.
If
D 2
.I sa_handler
is SIG_IGN the signal is subsequently ignored,
and pending instances of the signal are discarded.
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Fa sa_handler
is
I 6
.Dv SIG_DFL ,
the default action for the signal is to discard the signal,
and if a signal is pending,
the pending signal is discarded even if the signal is masked.
If
.Fa sa_handler
is set to
E 6
.Dv SIG_IGN
current and pending instances
of the signal are ignored and discarded.
.Pp
E 2
Options may be specified by setting
D 2
.IR sa_flags .
If the SA_NOCLDSTOP bit is set when installing a catching function
for the SIGCHLD signal,
the SIGCHLD signal will be generated only when a child process exits,
E 2
I 2
.Em sa_flags .
If the
.Dv SA_NOCLDSTOP
bit is set when installing a catching function
for the
.Dv SIGCHLD
signal,
the
.Dv SIGCHLD
signal will be generated only when a child process exits,
E 2
not when a child process stops.
D 2
Further, if the SA_ONSTACK bit is set in
.I sa_flags,
E 2
I 2
Further, if the
.Dv SA_ONSTACK
bit is set in
.Em sa_flags ,
E 2
the system will deliver the signal to the process on a
D 2
.IR "signal stack" ,
E 2
I 2
.Em "signal stack" ,
E 2
specified with
D 2

I 6
the call may return with a data transfer shorter than requested,

or the call may be restarted.
Restart of pending calls is requested

by setting the SA_RESTART bit in

The default signal action is termination
if the signal is not caught or ignored,
except for signals marked with \*b or \*d.
The starred signals in the list above cause termination with a core image.
Signals marked with \*b are discarded if the action
is SIG_DFL; signals marked
with \*d cause the process to stop.
The signals marked with \*p are not defined by POSIX.
