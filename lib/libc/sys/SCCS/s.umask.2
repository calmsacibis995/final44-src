.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Umask
D 2
sets a mask used whenever a file is created by
.IR creat (2)
or
.IR mknod (2):
the actual mode (see
.IR chmod (2))
of the newly-created file is the logical
.B and
of the given mode and the complement of the argument.
Only the low-order 9 bits of the mask (the protection bits)
participate.
In other words, the mask shows the bits to be turned off
when files are created.
E 2
I 2
sets the process's file mode creation mask to \fInumask\fP
and returns the previous value of the mask.  The low-order
9 bits of \fInumask\fP are used whenever a file is created,
clearing corresponding bits in the file mode

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/stat.h>
.Ft mode_t
.Fn umask "mode_t numask"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn umask
routine sets the process's file mode creation mask to
.Fa numask
and returns the previous value of the mask.  The 9 low-order
access permission
bits of
.Fa numask
are used by system calls, including
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
and
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
to turn off corresponding bits
requested in file mode.

The previous value of the mask is returned by the call.

The value is initially 022 (write access for owner only).
The mask is inherited by child processes.
