E 2
from the
D 2
.I timep
E 2
I 2
.I tvp
E 2
vector
to set the corresponding recorded times for
.I file.
.PP
The caller must be the owner of the file or the super-user.
D 2
The `inode-changed' time of the file is set to the current time.
E 2
I 2
The \*(lqinode-changed\*(rq time of the file is set to the current time.
.SH "RETURN VALUE

The first structure is the access time, and the second is the modification
time.
.Pp
If the times are specified (the

argument is
.Dv NULL )
the caller must be the owner of the file, have permission to
write the file, or be the super-user.
