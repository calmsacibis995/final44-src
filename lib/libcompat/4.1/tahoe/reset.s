 * C library -- reset, setexit
 *
 *	reset(x)
 * will generate a "return" from
 * the last call to
 *	setexit()
 * by restoring r2 - r12, fp
 * and doing a return.
 * The returned value is x; on the original
 * call the returned value is 0.
 *
 * useful for going back to the main loop
 * after a horrible error in a lowlevel
 * routine.
