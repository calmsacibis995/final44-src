Many variables which are used to describe the terminal environment
are available to the programmer. They are:

expand;
lw(6m) lw(8n) lw(50n).
type	name	description
_
WINDOW *	curscr	T{
.fi
current version of the screen (terminal screen).
T}
WINDOW *	stdscr	T{
standard screen.  Most updates are usually done here.
T}
char *	Def\*_term	T{
default terminal type if type cannot be determined
T}
bool	My\*_term	T{
use the terminal specification in \fIDef\*_term\fR as terminal,
irrelevant of real terminal type
T}
char *	ttytype	T{
full name of the current terminal.
