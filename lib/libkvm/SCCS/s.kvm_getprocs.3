.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn kvm_getprocs
returns a (sub-)set of active processes in the kernel indicated by
.Fa kd.
The
.Fa op
and
.Fa arg
arguments constitute a predicate which limits the set of processes
returned.  The value of
.Fa op
describes the filtering predicate as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 20n -offset indent -compact
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_ALL
all processes
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_PID
processes with process id 
.Fa arg
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_PGRP
processes with process group
.Fa arg
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_SESSION
processes with session
.Fa arg
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_TTY
processes with tty
.Fa arg
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_UID
processes with effective user id
.Fa arg
.It Sy KINFO_PROC_RUID
processes with real user id
.Fa arg
.El
.Pp
The number of processes found is returned in the reference parameter
.Fa cnt .
The processes are returned as a contiguous array of kinfo_proc structures.
D 5
This memory is owned by kvm and is not guaranteed to be persistent across
subsequent kvm library calls.  Data should be copied out if it needs to be
saved.
E 5
I 5
This memory is locally allocated, and subsequent calls to
.Fn kvm_getprocs 
and 
.Fn kvm_close
will overwrite this storage.

.Fn kvm_getargv
D 2
returns an null-terminated argument vector that corresponds to the 
E 2
I 2
returns a null-terminated argument vector that corresponds to the 
E 2
command line arguments passed to process indicated by
.Fa p .
Most likely, these arguments correspond to the values passed to
.Xr exec 3
D 2
on process creation.  However, this information exists only the
process address space, and is therefore alterable by the process
itself.   Note that the original command name can be found, unaltered,
E 2
I 2
on process creation.  This information is, however,
deliberately under control of the process itself.
Note that the original command name can be found, unaltered,
E 2
in the p_comm field of the process structure returned by
.Fn kvm_getprocs .
.Pp
The 
.Fa nchr
argument indicates the maximum number of characters, including null bytes,
to use in building the strings.  If this amount is exceeded, the string
causing the overflow is truncated and the partial result is returned.
This is handy for programs like
.Xr ps 1
and
D 2
.Xr w
that print only a one line summary of a command and should copy
out large numbers arguments that will not be printed.
E 2
I 2
.Xr w 1
that print only a one line summary of a command and should not copy
out large amounts of text only to ignore it.
If
.Fa nchr
is zero, no limit is imposed and all argument strings are returned in 
their entirety.

D 2
The memory allocated to the argv pointers as well as the string storage
are owned by the kvm library.  Data must be copied out of this
structure before calling another kvm function.
E 2
I 2
The memory allocated to the argv pointers and string storage
D 4
is owned by the kvm library.  Since subsequent kvm calls may clobber
this storage, data must be copied out if it needs to be saved.
E 4
I 4
is owned by the kvm library.  Subsequent 
.Fn kvm_getprocs 
and 
.Xr kvm_close 3
calls will clobber this storage.
E 4

.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_getenvv
function is similar to
.Fn kvm_getargv
D 4
but returns the vector of environment strings.  This is data is
E 4
I 4
but returns the vector of environment strings.  This data is
E 4
also alterable by the process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn kvm_getprocs ,
.Fn kvm_getargv ,
and
.Fn kvm_getenvv ,
D 2
all return NULL on failure.
E 2
I 2
all return
.Dv NULL
on failure.

.Sh BUGS
These routines do not belong in the kvm interface.
