/* ATANH(X)

 *
 * Special cases:
 *	atanh(x) is NaN if |x| > 1 with signal;
 *	atanh(NaN) is that NaN with no signal;

 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	atanh(x) returns the exact hyperbolic arc tangent of x nearly rounded.
 *	In a test run with 512,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum
 *	observed error was 1.87 ulps (units in the last place) at
 *	x= -3.8962076028810414000e-03.
