/* kahan's cube root (53 bits IEEE double precision)

 * Accuracy:
 *	better than 0.667 ulps according to an error analysis. Maximum
 * error observed was 0.666 ulps in an 1,000,000 random arguments test.
 *
 * Warning: this code is semi machine dependent; the ordering of words in
 * a floating point number must be known in advance. I assume that the
 * long interger at the address of a floating point number will be the
 * leading 32 bits of that floating point number (i.e., sign, exponent,
 * and the 20 most significant bits).
 * On a National machine, it has different ordering; therefore, this code 
 * must be compiled with flag -DNATIONAL.
