The

function
E 8
extracts the entry for terminal
D 8
.I name
E 8
I 8
.Fa name
E 8
into the buffer at
D 8
.I bp.
.I Bp
E 8
I 8
.Fa bp .
The
.Fa bp
argument
E 8
should be a character buffer of size
D 4
1024 and must be retained through all subsequent calls

I 8
.Fn tgetnum ,

E 8
and
D 8
.I tgetstr.
.I Tgetent
D 4
returns \-1 if it cannot open the
.I termcap
file, 0 if the terminal name given does not have an entry,
E 4
I 4
returns \-1 if none of the termcap
E 8
I 8
.Fn tgetstr .
The
.Fn tgetent
function
returns \-1 if none of the
.Nm termcap
E 8
data base files could be opened,
0 if the terminal name given does not have an entry,
E 4
and 1 if all goes well.
D 8
It will look in the environment for a TERMCAP variable.
E 8

It will look in the environment for a

E 8
If found, and the value does not begin with a slash,
and the terminal type
D 4
.B name
E 4
I 4
D 8
.I name
E 4
is the same as the environment string TERM,
D 4
the TERMCAP string is used instead of reading the termcap file.
If it does begin with a slash, the string is used as a path name rather than
.I /etc/termcap.
E 4
I 4
the TERMCAP string is used instead of reading a termcap file.
E 8
I 8
.Fa name
is the same as the environment string
.Ev TERM ,
the
.Ev TERMCAP
string is used instead of reading a
.Nm termcap
file.
E 8
If it does begin with a slash, the string is used as a path name
D 8
of the termcap file to search.
If TERMCAP does not begin with a slash and
.I name
is different from TERM,
.I tgetent
D 6
searches the files $HOME/.termcap and /etc/termcap,
E 6
I 6
searches the files $HOME/.termcap and /usr/share/misc/termcap,
E 6
in that order, unless the environment variable TERMPATH exists,
E 8
I 8
of the
.Nm termcap
file to search.
If
.Ev TERMCAP
does not begin with a slash and
.Fa name
is different from
.Ev TERM ,
.Fn tgetent
searches the files
.Pa $HOME/.termcap
and
.Pa /usr/share/misc/termcap ,
in that order, unless the environment variable
.Ev TERMPATH
exists,
E 8
in which case it specifies a list of file pathnames
(separated by spaces or colons) to be searched instead.
Whenever multiple files are searched and a
D 8
.B tc
E 8
I 8
.Sy tc
E 8
field occurs in the requested entry, the entry it names must be found
in the same file or one of the succeeding files.
E 4
This can speed up entry into programs that call
D 8
.IR tgetent ,
E 8
I 8
.Fn tgetent ,
E 8
D 4
as well as to help debug new terminal descriptions
or to make one for your terminal if you can't write the file

The

function
E 8
gets the numeric value of capability
D 8
.I id,
E 8
I 8
.Fa id ,
E 8

D 8
.I Tgetflag
E 8
I 8
The

function
E 8
returns 1 if the specified capability is present in
the terminal's entry, 0 if it is not.
D 8
.I Tgetstr
E 8
I 8
The

function
E 8

.I Tgoto
E 8
I 8
The

function
returns

If a \fB%\fR sequence is given which is not understood, then

If a
