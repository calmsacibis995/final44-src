It reads the message from the standard input or the named file, checks
the format and returns mail acknowledging receipt or a message 
indicating the proper format.  Valid reports are then summarized and

filed in the appropriate folder.  Users can then log onto the system and

are filed in a folder named ``errors.''
Program maintainers can then log onto the system and

check the summary file for bugs that pertain to them.
