.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rbootd
utility services boot requests from Hewlett-Packard workstations over a
E 2
local area network.
All boot files must reside in the boot file directory; further, if a
D 2
client supplies path information in its boot request, it will be
silently stripped away before processing.
E 2
I 2
client supplies path information in its boot request, it will be silently
stripped away before processing.
E 2
By default,
D 2
.I rbootd
only responds to requests from machines listed in its configuration
file.
.PP
.I Rbootd
supports the following command line options:
.TP
.B \-a
Respond to boot requests from any machine.  With this option,
the configuration file is ignored.
.TP
.B \-i intf
Service boot requests on specified interface.  If unspecified,
.I rbootd
searches the system interface list for the lowest numbered,
configured ``up'' interface (excluding loopback).  Ties are
broken by choosing the earliest match.
.TP
.B \-d
Run server in debug mode.  Packets sent and
received are displayed to the terminal.
.TP
.B ConfigFile
Specify a different configuration file.
.PP
The configuration file consists of ascii text where each line describes
a particular machine.  A line must start with a machines'
.I ethernet address
followed by an optional list of
.I boot file names.
An ethernet address is specified in hexadecimal with each of its six
octets separated by a colon.  The boot file names come from the boot
file directory.
The ethernet address and boot file(s) must be separated
by white-space and/or commas.  A pound sign causes the remainder of
a line to be ignored.  Here is a sample configuration file:
.in +4

Specifying
.Ar config_file
on the command line causes
.Nm rbootd
to use a different configuration file from the default.
.Pp
The configuration file is a text file where each line describes a particular
machine.
A line must start with a machine's Ethernet address followed by an optional
list of boot file names.

E 2
logs status and error messages via
D 2
.I syslog.
A startup message is always logged, and in the case of fatal
errors (or deadly signals) a message is logged announcing the
server's termination.  In general, a non-fatal error is handled
by ignoring the event that caused it (e.g. an invalid Ethernet
address in the config file causes that line to be invalidated).
.PP
The following signals have the specified effect when sent to
the server process using the kill(1) command.
.IP SIGHUP
