The
.Nm rshd
server
E 12
listens for service requests at the port indicated in
the ``cmd'' service specification; see
D 12
.IR services (5).
E 12
I 12
.Xr services 5 .
E 12
When a service request is received the following protocol
is initiated:
D 12
.IP 1)
E 12
I 12
.Bl -enum
.It
E 12
The server checks the client's source port.
D 10
If the port is not in the range 0-1023, the server
E 10
I 10
If the port is not in the range 512-1023, the server
E 10
aborts the connection.
D 12
.IP 2)
E 12
I 12
.It
E 12
The server reads characters from the socket up
to a null (`\e0') byte.  The resultant string is
D 12
interpreted as an ASCII number, base 10.
.IP 3)
E 12
I 12
interpreted as an
.Tn ASCII
number, base 10.
.It
E 12
D 5
If the number received in step 1 is non-zero,
E 5
I 5
If the number received in step 2 is non-zero,
E 5
it is interpreted as the port number of a secondary
stream to be used for the 
D 12
.BR stderr .
E 12
I 12
.Em stderr .
E 12
A second connection is then created to the specified
port on the client's machine.  The source port of this
D 10
second connection is also in the range 0-1023.
E 10
I 10
second connection is also in the range 512-1023.
E 10
D 12
.IP 4)
E 12
I 12
.It
E 12
D 4
The server checks the client's source address.
If the address is associated with a host for which no
corresponding entry exists in the host name data base (see
.IR hosts (5)),
the server aborts the connection.
E 4
I 4
The server checks the client's source address
and requests the corresponding host name (see
D 9
.IR gethostbyaddr (3N),
E 9
I 9
D 12
.IR gethostbyaddr (3),
E 9
.IR hosts (5)

and
D 12
.IR named (8)).
E 12

.Xr named 8 ) .
E 12
If the hostname cannot be determined,
the dot-notation representation of the host address is used.
I 10
If the hostname is in the same domain as the server (according to
the last two components of the domain name),
or if the
D 12
.B \-a
E 12
I 12
.Fl a
E 12

the addresses for the hostname are requested,
verifying that the name and address correspond.
If address verification fails, the connection is aborted
with the message, ``Host address mismatch.''

D 4
The remote user name is looked up in the password file
E 4
I 4
The local (server-end) user name is looked up in the password file
E 4
and a
.I chdir
is performed to the user's home directory.  If either
the lookup or 
.I chdir
fail, the connection is terminated.
If the user is not the super-user, (user id 0), the file 
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
is consulted for a list of hosts considered ``equivalent''.
If the client's host name is present in this file, the
authentication is considered successful.  If the lookup
fails, or the user is the super-user, then the file
.I .rhosts
in the home directory of the remote user is checked for
the machine name and identity of the user on the client's
machine.  If this lookup fails, the connection is terminated.
E 7
I 7
then validates the user using
D 12
.IR ruserok (3),
which uses the file ``/etc/hosts.equiv'' and the ``.rhosts''
E 12
I 12
