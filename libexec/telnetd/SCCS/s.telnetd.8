.Xr services 5 ) .
The
.Fl debug
option may be used to start up
.Nm telnetd
E 12
manually, instead of through
D 12
.IR inetd (8).
If started up this way, \fIport\fP may be specified to
run \fItelnetd\fP on an alternate TCP port number.
E 8
E 3
.PP
I 8
The \fB\-D\fP option may be used for debugging purposes.
This allows \fItelnet\fR to print out debugging information
to the connection, allowing the user to see what telnetd
E 12
I 12
.Xr inetd 8 .
If started up this way, 
.Ar port
may be specified to run
.Nm telnetd
on an alternate
.Tn TCP
port number.
.Pp
The
.Nm telnetd
command accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "-a authmode"
.It Fl a Ar authmode
This option may be used for specifying what mode should
be used for authentication.
Note that this option is only useful if
.Nm telnetd
has been compiled with support for the
.Dv AUTHENTICATION
option.
There are several valid values for
.Ar authmode:
.Bl -tag -width debug
.It debug
Turns on authentication debugging code.
.It user
Only allow connections when the remote user
can provide valid authentication information
to identify the remote user,
and is allowed access to the specified account
without providing a password.
.It valid
Only allow connections when the remote user
can provide valid authentication information
to identify the remote user.
The
.Xr login 1
command will provide any additional user verification
needed if the remote user is not allowed automatic
access to the specified account.
.It other
Only allow connections that supply some authentication information.
This option is currently not supported
by any of the existing authentication mechanisms,
and is thus the same as specifying
.Fl a
.Cm valid .
.It none
This is the default state.
Authentication information is not required.
If no or insufficient authentication information
is provided, then the
.Xr login 1
program will provide the necessary user
verification.
.It off
This disables the authentication code.
All user verification will happen through the
.Xr login 1
program.
.El
.It Fl B
Specifies bftp server mode.  In this mode,
.Nm telnetd
causes login to start a
.Xr bftp 1
session rather than the user's
normal shell.  In bftp daemon mode normal
logins are not supported, and it must be used
on a port other than the normal
.Tn TELNET
port.
.It Fl D Ar debugmode
This option may be used for debugging purposes.
This allows
.Nm telnetd
to print out debugging information
to the connection, allowing the user to see what
.Nm telnetd
E 12
is doing.
D 12
There are several modifiers:
\fBoptions\fR prints information about the negotiation
of \fBTELNET\fR options,
\fBreport\fR prints the \fBoptions\fR information, plus
some additional information about what processing is going on,
\fBnetdata\fP displays the data stream received by \fItelnetd\fP,
\fBptydata\fP displays data written to the pty, and
\fBexercise\fR has not been implemented yet.

E 8
.I Telnetd
E 12
I 12
There are several possible values for 
.Ar debugmode:
.Bl -tag -width exercise
.It Cm options
Prints information about the negotiation of
.Tn TELNET
options.
.It Cm report
Prints the 
.Cm options
information, plus some additional information
about what processing is going on.
.It Cm netdata
Displays the data stream received by
.Nm telnetd.
.It Cm ptydata
Displays data written to the pty.
.It Cm exercise
Has not been implemented yet.
.El
.It Fl debug
Enables debugging on each socket created by
.Nm telnetd
(see
.Dv SO_DEBUG
in
.Xr socket 2 ) .
.It Fl edebug
If
.Nm telnetd
has been compiled with support for data encryption, then the
.Fl edebug
option may be used to enable encryption debugging code.
.It Fl h
Disables the printing of host-specific information before
login has been completed.
.It Fl I Ar initid
This option is only applicable to
.Tn UNICOS
systems prior to 7.0.
It specifies the
.Dv ID
from
.Pa /etc/inittab
to use when init starts login sessions.  The default
.Dv ID
is
.Dv fe.
.It Fl k
This option is only useful if
.Nm telnetd
has been compiled with both linemode and kludge linemode
support.  If the
.Fl k
option is specified, then if the remote client does not
support the
.Dv LINEMODE
option, then
.Nm telnetd
will operate in character at a time mode.
It will still support kludge linemode, but will only
go into kludge linemode if the remote client requests
it.
(This is done by by the client sending
.Dv DONT SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD
and
.Dv DONT ECHO . )
The
.Fl k
option is most useful when there are remote clients
that do not support kludge linemode, but pass the heuristic
(if they respond with
.Dv WILL TIMING-MARK
in response to a
.Dv DO TIMING-MARK)
for kludge linemode support.
.It Fl l
Specifies line mode.  Tries to force clients to use line-
at-a-time mode.
If the
.Dv LINEMODE
option is not supported, it will go
into kludge linemode.
.It Fl n
Disable
.Dv TCP
keep-alives.  Normally
.Nm telnetd
enables the
.Tn TCP
keep-alive mechanism to probe connections that
have been idle for some period of time to determine
if the client is still there, so that idle connections
from machines that have crashed or can no longer
be reached may be cleaned up.
.It Fl r Ar lowpty-highpty
This option is only enabled when
.Nm telnetd
is compiled for
.Dv UNICOS.
It specifies an inclusive range of pseudo-terminal devices to
use.  If the system has sysconf variable
.Dv _SC_CRAY_NPTY
configured, the default pty search range is 0 to
.Dv _SC_CRAY_NPTY;
otherwise, the default range is 0 to 128.  Either
.Ar lowpty
or
.Ar highpty
may be omitted to allow changing
either end of the search range.  If
.Ar lowpty
is omitted, the - character is still required so that
.Nm telnetd
can differentiate
.Ar highpty
from
.Ar lowpty .
.It Fl s
This option is only enabled if
.Nm telnetd
is compiled with support for
.Tn SecurID
cards.
It causes the
.Fl s
option to be passed on to
.Xr login 1 ,
and thus is only useful if
.Xr login 1
supports the
.Fl s
flag to indicate that only
.Tn SecurID
validated logins are allowed, and is
usually useful for controlling remote logins
from outside of a firewall.
.It Fl S Ar tos
.It Fl u Ar len
This option is used to specify the size of the field
in the
.Dv utmp
structure that holds the remote host name.
If the resolved host name is longer than
.Ar len ,
the dotted decimal value will be used instead.
This allows hosts with very long host names that
overflow this field to still be uniquely identified.
Specifying
.Fl u0
indicates that only dotted decimal addresses
should be put into the
.Pa utmp
file.
I 14
.ne 1i
E 14
.It Fl U
This option causes
.Nm telnetd
to refuse connections from addresses that
cannot be mapped back into a symbolic name
via the
.Xr gethostbyaddr 3
routine.
.It Fl X Ar authtype
This option is only valid if
.Nm telnetd
has been built with support for the authentication option.
It disables the use of
.Ar authtype
authentication, and
can be used to temporarily disable
a specific authentication type without having to recompile
.Nm telnetd .

option is enabled, a
.Dv WILL ECHO
or
.Dv WONT ECHO
will be sent to the client to indicate the
current state of terminal echoing.
When terminal echo is not desired, a

client should do any terminal echoing that is needed.
.It "WILL BINARY"
Indicates that the client is willing to send a
8 bits of data, rather than the normal 7 bits
of the Network Virtual Terminal.
.It "WILL SGA"
Indicates that it will not be sending
.Dv IAC GA,
go ahead, commands.

protocol allows for
the exchange of the number of lines and columns on the user's terminal,
but
.I telnetd
doesn't make use of them.
