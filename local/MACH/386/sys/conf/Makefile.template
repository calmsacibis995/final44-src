# $Log:	Makefile.template,v $
# Revision 2.30.5.2  90/05/14  13:17:16  rvb
# 	Revision 1.6  90/05/01  21:26:13  kupfer
# 	Add VOLATILE_LINT, so that we can lint files with "volatile" while
# 	building them with gcc.  (lint doesn't understand "volatile", gcc does.)
# 	[90/05/04            rvb]
# 
# Revision 2.30.5.1  89/10/22  11:29:08  rvb
# 	Revision 1.4  89/09/27  15:53:53  kupfer
# 	Put back support for GNU Emacs TAGS.
# 
# Revision 2.30  89/06/12  14:54:14  jsb
# 	Changed mach/mach.h is MACH_GENFILES to mach/mach_interface.h
# 	[89/06/05            mrt]
# 
# Revision 2.29  89/05/11  14:40:50  gm0w
# 	Removed explicit dependencies on file generated in ./mach/.
# 	These dependencies were previously required to trigger
# 	the ./mach rules; now mig{,debug}{,machine}files does this.
# 	[89/05/07  20:10:16  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.28  89/05/06  02:56:49  rpd
# 	Removed references to ./mach/mach_user.c, which is no longer generated.
# 	[89/05/06  02:39:13  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.27  89/05/01  15:23:05  rpd
# 	Changed remaining references to ./mach/memory_object.h to
# 	./mach/memory_object_user.h.
# 	[89/05/01  13:57:19  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.26  89/04/09  00:06:29  rpd
# 	Removed MIG_BOGUS_FILES and other Mig crap.
# 	[89/04/09  00:05:53  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.25  89/02/25  17:39:48  gm0w
# 	Removed obsolete rules for links, tags, printing, etc.
# 	[89/02/19            rpd]
# 
# 	Added MIG_BOGUS_FILES and rules to create the bogus files.
# 	The Mig-generated files use these old names.
# 	[89/02/19            rpd]
# 
# 	Converted migfiles/migdebugfiles rules to new format.
# 	[89/02/18            rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.24  89/01/31  01:50:24  rpd
# 	Picked up dlb's migfiles/migdebugfiles changes, but flushed
# 	the mach_host additions.  (They will get merged later.)
# 	[89/01/31            rpd]
# 
# 	Add mach_host.defs and related files.
# 	Add intermediate targets to kick off interface mig runs early.
# 	[89/01/25            dlb]
# 
# Revision 2.23  89/01/24  17:00:55  af
# 	Fixed the broken set of rules for mach_debug.   No comment.
# 
# Revision 2.22  89/01/23  22:16:16  af
# 	The basic change is that locore.s and ioconf.c are no longer
# 	special cased.  ioconf.c is now specified in files.  If you need
# 	some special treatment for locore.s, then do it in the machine
# 	dependent Makefile rules.  These changes where necessary to be
# 	more general in order to accomodate mips.
# 	
# 	The %<foo> order was changed to have %MACHDEP last.  So
# 	that it could have rules that dependended on SOBJS and COBJS.
# 	
# 	"makevariables" get emited after the %MACHDEP expansion.
# 	This means that the %MACHDEP can have variables that overide the
# 	defaults in the Makefile.template and that a given configuration
# 	file can overide the variables in the %MACHDEP (local Makefile).
# 	This works wonderfully for gcc.
# 	
# 	The text following a "|" in the files file, will be
# 	emitted as part of the rule for the given file.
# 	
# 	Lastly, you might want to look at the comments in the src/config
# 	program, especially in mkmakefile.c
# 	[89/01/09            rvb]
# 
#
# Revision 2.21  89/01/15  16:19:56  rpd
# 	Moved interfaces from kern/ to mach/.
# 	Moved rules for the mach_debug_ca interface to Makefile.ca.
# 	[89/01/15  14:53:06  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.20  89/01/12  07:42:30  rpd
# 	Updated for new Mig files in kern/, mach_debug/, ca/ directories.
# 	[89/01/12  04:34:35  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.19  88/12/19  02:40:21  mwyoung
# 	Split out ALLOPTS from old LINTOPTS, and provide VOLATILE only
# 	for lint.  I'm not sure why it's not safe to always use
# 	VOLATILE, but Bob didn't set things up that way.
# 	[88/12/19            mwyoung]
# 	
# 	Add volatile definition for lint.  It should be machine-dependent,
# 	but all forms of lint are based on pcc currently.
# 	[88/12/17            mwyoung]
# 
# Revision 2.18  88/11/23  16:35:34  rpd
# 	Added comments explaining PRELDDEPS.
# 	[88/11/05  13:45:58  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.17  88/10/20  18:19:42  mwyoung
# 	Move the "default" target ahead of .PRECIOUS.
# 	[88/10/18            mwyoung]
# 
# Revision 2.16  88/10/18  03:17:29  mwyoung
# 	Update Makefile (with "md") only upon exit.
# 	[88/10/17            mwyoung]
# 
# Revision 2.15  88/09/07  15:47:41  rpd
# 	Explicitly use generated make script when checking dependencies.
# 	[88/09/05  21:32:22  rpd]
# 
# Revision 2.14  88/08/06  18:07:21  rpd
# Convert to use new memory_object files.
# No longer need -I flags, because the generated make script
# does it all with CPATH.
# 
# Revision 2.13  88/07/17  20:38:52  mwyoung
# Fix typo in previous change.
# 
# Revision 2.12  88/07/17  20:28:25  mwyoung
# Add mach_types.defs to the list of things to get from kern/.
# 
# Revision 2.11  88/07/17  18:48:49  mwyoung
# Convert to use new memory_object files.
# 
# Revision 2.10  88/07/15  15:48:26  mja
# Don't reset CPATH here since it is now set in the calling
# ./make script to track VPATH;  pass ../conf/copyright to
# ../conf/newvers.sh for VPATH;  define MD variable;  correct
# dependencies on kern/* and replace wildcards with explicit
# names all for VPATH.
# 
# 20-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Always remove and rebuild kern/ when dependencies change.
#
# 17-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	More dependencies on kern/ files.
#
# 11-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Simplify B_RULEs to decode directly from the source directory.
#
#  7-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Build MiG-generated interfaces in the build directory.
#	Unfortunately, the generated file "mach.h" conflicts with the
#	option file of the same name, so the interfaces get built in a
#	subdirectory.
#
#  7-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Decode binary (".b") files into object files.
#
#  2-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Temporarily added rules to make "strings.h" until MiG can be
#	convinced not to include it unless strings are being used.
#
# 18-May-88  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Add .PRECIOUS target to prevent Makefile from ever being
#	deleted on interrupt.
#	[ V5.1(XF25) ]
#
# 09-Apr-88  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Corrected object and binary rules to permit errors and remove
#	target before copying in new version (in case it is not
#	writeable);  added version file for patch level;  changed "md"
#	invocation to simply wildcard all files rather than only those
#	newer than "Makefile" since this can often cause files to be
#	overlooked if "Makefile" is touched before they are
#	incorporated.
#	[ V5.1(XF23) ]
#
# 31-Mar-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Allow source directory to be other than "..".
#
# 31-Mar-88  Robert Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Need to have ${VOLATILE} for genassym
#
# 28-Mar-88  Robert Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Add macros VOLATILE and FORCE_VOLATILE as per change in
#	conf/files.<machine> file:
#	VOLATILE	is included if the file contains the ansi C
#			 volatile keyword
#	FORCE_VOLATILE	is included if the file has volatile memory 
#			references, but does not use declare them
#			correctly.
#	(also see comment in config/mkmakefile.c)
#
# 29-Feb-88  Robert Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Add VOLATILE macro which is fed to the preprocessor to macro define
#	the "keyword" volatile to an empty string.  On gcc builds, the
#	local Makefile will define VOLATILE= which lets the volatile
#	definitions show thru.
#
#  6-Jan-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Change references from h/ to sys/.
#	Remove all but the most pertinent history.
#
# 15-Dec-87  Robert Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Add rules to profile a system as it is build.  The target is
#	gprof.
#
# 09-Nov-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Update LDDEPS to include remaining files used by .swap.sys rule
#	in order to work with RCS; add CFILES dependency to "tags"
#	rule;  added new SYSDEPS definition;  change to create
#	symbols.sort in build directory;  fix to use explicit names in
#	version files to work with RCS;  add new "checkout" rule to
#	permit manual extraction of files from RCS when the
#	dependencies aren't current;  added KCC and KCPP definitions
#	for compiling kernel modules to clear the default search list
#	to prevent accidental inclusion of external include files
#	(especially important when working with header files in RCS
#	where this can easily occur from a missing dependency and a
#	checked-in source).
#	[ V5.1(XF21) ]
#
# 24-Oct-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Name version files explicitly to avoid .BAK .CKP etc.
#
# 10-Oct-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Updated to pass all four version component files to the
#	"newvers.sh" script (which now includes them as kernel
#	variables and creates a version suffix) and changed SYS_RULE_4
#	to also link kernel images with the version suffix provided by
#	this script;  corrected "clean" rule to use new "LOAD" symbol
#	(provided by the "config" program) to remove all configured
#	kernel images related files;  revised symbols.sort rule to
#	use a new MACHINEDIR variable so that it can be overridden
#	for use with directories other than ../machine
#	[ V5.1(XF18) ]
#
# 11-Mar-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Flushed all the "features.h" stuff since this is now a machine
#	independent file.  The equivalent function is now performed by
#	the "doconf" script if an appropriate features file exists in
#	the "machine" directory.
#	[ V5.1(F6) ]
#
# 19-Jan-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Created (from old Makefile.vax).
#	[ V5.1(F1) ]
#
# 01-Oct-86  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Reorganized to support simplified config program:
#	- COPTS_P variable defines the options used differently when
#	  compiling profiled kernels
#	- LDOBJS is the set of special objects used by the kernel load(s)
#	- LDDEPS is the set of dependencies for the kernel load(s)
#	- SWAPDEPS is the set of dependencies for the swapping module(s)
#	- Kernel configurations are built from a default rule defined here
#	  instead of inside config;  an artificial .swap.sys rule is used 
#	  to trigger this for each swap configuration
#	- Standard rules for building objects in the various normal, driver,
#	  and profiling cases are also defined here instead of inside config.
#	
#	Removed special rules for param.c and replaced PARAM variable
#	with include of new "confdep.h" file now generated by config;
#	also changed ioconf.c to use standard rules.
#	
#	Revised version number processing to eliminate newvers.c program and
#	only increment the version number as part of the archival process
#       rather than on every build.
#
# 18-Apr-86  Robert V. Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
#	Introduce new make depend stuff.

#  This must be here before any rules are possibly defined by the
#  machine dependent makefile fragment so that a plain "make" command
#  always works.  The config program will emit an appropriate rule to
#  cause "all" to depend on every kernel configuration it generates.
#

default: all

#
#  In order to move the link commands out of config and back into the
#  template makefile, config has been changed to emit a dendency rule
#  of the form *vmunix.sys: *vmunix.swap for each configuration so that
#  the common commands for building each configuration can be placed
#  directly in the template in the default rule for the .sys.swap
