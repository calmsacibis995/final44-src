Use "void" where appropriate.

Fix the function header comments to track the changes made in
switching from System V to BSD.

Use BLITFB macro.  Try to make it functional (i.e., one that produces
an expression, rather than one that does an assignment).

Support for auto-config. [1 day]

Query info-mach: should the driver explicitly mark the Blit as
non-pageable? 

Document the "generic" bitmap code as being for displays that
reference the bitmap a byte at a time.  The 786 refers to the display
a word at a time.  Fortunately, it all seems to work because the
characters stored in the ROM are one word wide and are apparently
byte-swapped so that they can be copied straight into the frame
buffer.  It's probably not worth trying to make the Blit code more
general (e.g., to handle fonts where the characters are a byte wide),
but it would be good to document all this.

Use symbolic constants rather than magic numbers in kdcheckmagic() and
elsewhere.  (grep for XXX in sources)

Use a bottom margin (reduce interline spacing, make cursor smaller).

Should use EPROM for determining screen size (and similar values), DP
register block.

Do you need explicit permission checks for /dev/kbd & /dev/mouse
ioctl's?  The Sun /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse are chmod 666, which leads
me to believe they don't do any permission checking...
[2 days]

Faster scrolling when emulating a console.

You should fix freeblit() so that it actually frees the allocated
virtual addr's.
