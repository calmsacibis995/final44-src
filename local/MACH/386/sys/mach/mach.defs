 *
 * 19-Jun-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added vm_map, pager_data_error.  Removed obsolete entries.
 *
 * 28-Jan-88 Douglas Orr (dorr) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added task_set_emulation. Note that task_set_emulation
 *	only works in kernels with the MACH_EMULATION attribute on.
 *	task_get_ioport only works in kernels with the MACH_DEVICE
 *	attribute on.
 *
 * 21-Jan-88  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added new thread and task interfaces.  Obsolete interfaces
 *	are prefixed with 'xxx_' but remain (temporarily) for binary
 *	compatibility.  Made task_create no longer return the task's
 *	data port (it doesn't exist).  Removed obsolete external pager
 *	interfaces (per mwyoung): pager_data_lock, pager_clean_request,
 *	pager_flush_request.
 *
 *  3-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added deallocator functions for task_t, thread_t, vm_map_t.
 *
