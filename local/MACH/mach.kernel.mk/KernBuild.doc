After supping the kernel sources you need to make a few modifications.
Assuming that you have cd'ed to the base of your source tree, e.g. /usr/kernel:

1. Make two symbolic links for your machine type
    ln -s {i386|sun3|ca|vax|mmax} machine
    ln -s mach/{i386|sun3|ca|vax|mmax} mach/machine

2. Change Makeconf to select a local build directory and the
   default configuration that you want to build. The rest of
   the file can be deleted leaving only the following lines;
	OBJECTDIR=./build
	CONFIG=STD+WS-afs-nfs
   Note: since we do not sup the afs files to anyone you must include
    -afs in any configuration you build. The nfs files are only supped
    to sites with an NFS Educational Institution license.

3. Change the #include ../../${MAKETOP}Makefile-common to
    #include ${MAKETOP}Makefile-common, since Makefile-common
    is in the current source directory. Note: if your version of make
    doesn't understand ${MAKETOP}, you can use ${MAKECONF:h} instead.

4. Create the OBJECTDIR

5. Now "make >& log &" should create the directories bin, src, and
   STD+WS in the OBJECTDIR and proceed to build  a kernel in OBJECT/STD+WS.

   "make CONFIG=<config_name>" will build a specific configuation.

Configurations are defined in the conf/MASTER* files. Specific features
may be added to the STD+{WS|ANY|MF}{+EXP} configurations by using
+|-<feature>. The latest kerenel configurations include nfs and afs
which you may not have been able to sup because of licensing restrictions.
STD+WS-afs-nfs will build a kernel without these files. The vax
STD+{MF|MP|ANY} configurations contain dialup ip support which is also not
supped. STD+{MF|MP|ANY}-du builds without this feature.
  WS -> workstation (on vax requires ultrix source license)
  MF -> main frame
  MP -> multi processor (bi bus)
  ANY -> extra device drivers
  EXP -> experimental and debugging features.

Note: There are many options defined in the MASTER files that do not
	build. If you start selecting things other than the ones used
	by the standard configs they may not work.
