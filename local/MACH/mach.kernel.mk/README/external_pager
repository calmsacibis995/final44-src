If the kernel is built with the afs, nfs, cfs or vfs options it will
use a new inode that pages to a paging file rather
than anonymous inodes. The program src/swappingfile/swapon replaces
/etc/swapon and will read /etc/fstab and create paging files. If
no paging files exist, the inode pager will call panic when it first
attempts to page out. 
  There is documentation in src/swappingfile on how to set up
fstab. An example follows:

/dev/rz0a:/:rw:1:1
/dev/rz0b:/paging0:rw:0:6:ufs:paging,pagelowat=1,pagehiwat=0
/dev/rz0d:/sys0:rw:1:2
/dev/rz0e:/usr0:rw:1:3:ufs:paging,pagelowat=1,pagehiwat=6M

pagelowat=0 means do not shrink the paging file.
pagehiwat=0 means grow the paging file as large as possible.

If you are switching between a Mach 2.5 and Mach 3.0 system and
you wish to  use the same paging file you must set pagelowat to
be the same value as pagehiwat and create a pagingfile that is
that size. This is because the Mach 3.0 inode pager cannot grow
the paging file and the Mach 2.5 inodde pager will try to make
it smaller if pagelowat is less than pagehiwat.
