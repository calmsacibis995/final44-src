#
#  Explanation of Mach IPC options:
#
#  The multitude of IPC options allow various features to be turned on/off
#  for compatibility purposes.  Unless you have a specific need,
#  they should be left with their default values.  (Note that at CMU
#  some of the backwards-compatibility options are turned on in
#  the conf/MASTER.local file.)  There are also a few options for
#  for debugging/measuring purposes, that do not change IPC semantics.
#  The options are all independent; any combination will work.
#
#	MACH_IPC_SIGHACK (ipc_sighack) (default is OFF)
#		When enabled, messages sent to ports in ports sets
#		will generate signals in the receiving task.  (If
#		MSG_TYPE_EMERGENCY, then SIGEMSG, else SIGMSG.)  This
#		feature (emergency messages, too) is obsolete.  It is
#		no longer necessary now that Mach supports
#		multi-threaded tasks, and it is very awkward to
#		implement when Unix signal functionality is no longer
#		in the kernel.  It is enabled at CMU in MASTER.local
#		because CMU Common Lisp still relies on it.
#
#	MACH_IPC_STATS (ipc_stats) (default is OFF)
#		When enabled, some IPC statistics are collected at
#		runtime.  If MACH_DEBUG is also enabled, then the
#		host_ipc_statistics and host_ipc_statistics_reset
#		kernel calls may be used.  Otherwise, adb/kdb work.
#		The disadvantage to enabling it is that the kernel
#		gets a little bigger and IPC operations get a little
#		slower.  At CMU, it is enabled in MASTER.local for EXP
#		configurations.
#
#	MACH_IPC_TCACHE (ipc_tcache) (default is ON)
#		This option enables a cache of (task, name) -> port
#		(ie, port translations) mappings.  The MACH_IPC_STATS
#		option enables collection of hit/miss statistics for
#		the cache.  The advantage to enabling it is that IPC
#		operations generally get faster.  The big disadvantage
#		is that the task structure gets bigger.
#
#	MACH_IPC_WWA (ipc_wwa) (default is OFF)
#		This option controls exactly how blocked senders are
#		woken up when there is room in the port's queue.  If
#		enabled, a blocked sender is woken up as soon as there
#		is space in the queue.  If disabled, all blocked
#		senders are woken up when the queue is completely
#		drained.  The advantage to having it disabled is that
#		Rick's streaming IPC test gets better times.  Presumably
#		if we had good scheduling we could turn it on.
#
#	MACH_IPC_XXXHACK (ipc_xxxhack) (default is OFF)
#		This is the main backwards-compatibility option.  When
#		enabled (done at CMU in MASTER.local), the old message
#		traps and kernel calls still work.  It also turns on
#		ownership rights.  The big disadvantage is that it
#		makes the kernel bigger.  (The time penalty is small.)
