 * 	Add HW_AST option to support hardware (e.g. vax) that does ast's

 *	There are two types of AST's:
 *		1.  This thread must context switch [call thread_block()]
 *		2.  This thread must do something bizarre
 *			[call thread_halt_self()]
 *
 *	Type 2 ASTs are kept in a field in the thread which encodes the
 *	bizarre thing the thread must do.
 *
 *	The need_ast array (per processor) records whether ASTs are needed
 *	for each processor.  For now each processor only has access to its
 *	own cell in that array.  [May change when we record which 
 *	processor each thread is executing on.]
 *
 *	need_ast is initialized from the thread's ast field at context
 *	switch.  Type 1 ASTs are entered directly into the field
 *	by aston().  The actual values in need_ast do not matter, 
 *	an ast is required if it is non-zero.
