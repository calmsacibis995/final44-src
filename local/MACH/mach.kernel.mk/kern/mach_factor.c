/*
 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	mach_factor.c,v $
 * Revision 2.4  89/10/11  14:13:38  dlb
 * 	Complete rewrite to calculate statistics for all processor sets, and
 * 		for being called by sched thread.
 * 	Don't divide by ncpus in calculating load average.
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  89/02/25  18:05:36  gm0w
 * 	Changes for cleanup.
 * 
 * 25-Mar-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added sched_load calculation.
 *
 *  4-Dec-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fix calculation to correctly account for threads that are
 *	actually on cpus.  This used to work by accident because if a
 *	processor is not idle, its idle thread was on the local runq;
 *	this is no longer the case.
 *
 * 18-Nov-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Removed conditionals, compute every second.
