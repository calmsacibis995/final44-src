 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	timer.c,v $
 * Revision 2.8  90/03/27  18:48:17  dlb
 * 	Convert timer_grab to a real routine instead of a macro by
 * 	popular demand.  It's not in any critical paths.
 * 	[90/03/15            dlb]
 * 	#ifdef out trap, interrupt, and switch routines for multimax.
 * 	These have been moved to inline assembly language for speed.  See
 * 	mmax/timer_macros.h and mmax/inline/multimaxpats.c.
 * 	[90/01/05            dlb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  89/10/11  14:35:01  dlb
 * 	Optimize timer_normalize and timer_grab based on new timer
 * 	representation.  This is a simple version of a Lamport clock
 * 	based on a suggestion by dbg (again!).  The savings in
 * 	timer_grab are impressive.
 * 	[89/09/12            dlb]
 * 
 * 	New overflow logic.  Check low_bits directly for risk of
 * 	overflow.  Gets rid of service_timers().  Suggested by dbg.
 * 	[88/10/26            dlb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.6  89/03/09  20:17:23  rpd
 * 	More cleanup.
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  89/02/25  18:10:44  gm0w
 * 	Changes for cleanup.
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  89/01/30  22:07:42  rpd
 * 	Added declarations of variables from kern/timer.h.
 * 	(The declarations there use "extern" now.)
 * 	[89/01/25  15:19:35  rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.3  88/12/19  02:48:18  mwyoung
 * 	Remove lint.
 * 	[88/12/09            mwyoung]
 * 
 * 18-May-88  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	HC compiler does not consider '| =' to be the same as '|='.
 *
 *  9-May-88  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added register declarations.  Not all machines enjoy the luxury
 *	of a reasonable compiler.
 *
 * 20-Apr-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Removed thread_times system call.
 *
 * 29-Mar-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Normalize old timer on interrupt exit if needed.
 *
 * 19-Feb-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Massive changes - parametrize most constants to deal with
 *	different clock frequencies, field name changes in timer
 *	structure.  Replace array in thread structure with individual
 *	timers.  Implemented timer_delta and timer_current_delta routines
 *	to efficiently read timing information for scheduler.
 *
 * 12-Feb-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Use time_value_t's instead of struct timeval's.
 *
 * 28-Jan-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Rewrote thread_times for new port naming and thread referencing
 *	logic.
 *
 * 26-Mar-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed trap entry and exit routines to always set correct timer
 *	regardless of current timer.
 *
 * 18-Mar-87  David L. Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Moved kickoff of service_timers() into init_main.c because
 *	callout queue is not initialized when init_timers is called.
 *
 * 23-Feb-87  David L. Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Created.
