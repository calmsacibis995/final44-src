.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Swapon
is used to specify additional devices or files on which swapping or 
paging are to take place.
Calls to
.I swapon
normally occur in the system multi-user initialization file
.I /etc/rc
making all swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping 
activity is interleaved across several devices.
Under
.B MACH
the system may make use of one or more paging files instead of swap devices.

Normally, the
.B \-a
argument is given, causing all mounted devices marked with the ``paging''
option in
.B /etc/fstab
to be made available for sustaining paging files.  These paging files
will be named
.I pagingfile
in the root of the mounted file system specified.
Each paging file has both lower and upper bounds 
on its size.  The kernel
truncates the file to its lower bound.  The kernel 
doesn't let the
paging file grow larger than its upper 
bound.  An upper bound
of zero indicates unlimited growth.  The options field of 
.B /etc/fstab
may also be used to to specify the following paging options.
.TP 8
.B  "pageprefer"
Specifies this to be a preferred paging file and device.
The kernel will pick a preferred
file over a non-preferred file when it assigns a memory object
to a paging file.
.TP 8
.B  "pagehiwat=num"
Specifies 
.B num
to be the upper bound of the paging file.
.TP 8
.B  "pagelowat=num"
Specifies
.B num
to be the lower bound of the paging file.
.i0
.DT
.PP
.B Num
may be suffixed with either 
.B  "k, m,"
or
.B  "g"
to specify kilobyte megabyte or gigabyte, respectively.

The second form gives individual block devices as given
in the system swap configuration table.  The call makes only this space
available to the system for swap allocation.

The third form of the command is used to specify a paging device and file
(which will be created) for the system to begin using for backing store
in much the same way as is specified in
.B /etc/fstab.
.I Swapon
interprets several options.
.TP 8
.B \-v
Be verbose about what the call does.
.TP 8
.B \-p
Make this paging file preferred.
.TP 8
.B  "-l size"
Specifies the lower bound for the paging file.
The value should be a number of bytes.
The default is zero bytes.
.TP 8
.B  "-h size"
Specifies the upper bound for the paging file.
The value should be a number of bytes.
The default is zero bytes, or unlimited growth.
.i0
.DT
.PP
For both the 
.B \-l
and
.B \-h
options, the suffixes
.B  k m
and
.B  g
may be added to 
.B  size
to specify kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte as in
.I  20m 
for twenty megabytes

.SH FILES
/dev/[ra][rz][sd][ru][pk]?b	normal paging devices

/?/pagingfile			default name of paging file created.
.SH BUGS
There is no way to stop paging or swapping on a device.
It is therefore not possible to make use of devices which may be
dismounted during system operation.

If no suitable paging file is ever given to the kernel, it will eventually
run out of memory.
