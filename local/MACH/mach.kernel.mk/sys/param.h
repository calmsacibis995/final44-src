 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	param.h,v $
 * Revision 2.15  91/08/30  09:39:02  berman
 * 	Drop the balance and multimax hack for allocating 100 processes per
 * 	users...When people make mistakes, they slowly but surely accumlate
 * 	lots of dead processes alas such a large number drains the master
 * 	processes table causing the system to crash instead of the user not
 * 	being allowed to create more processes. Alas there is no limits of
 * 	on the total number of threads.
 * 	[91/07/30  13:01:57  ern]
 * 
 * Revision 2.14  91/08/29  22:41:30  berman

 * 
 * Revision 2.9  89/02/25  17:55:14  gm0w

 *

 * 	extra #include statements.
 * 	[89/01/09            af]
 * 	
 * 	Changes for I386 -- define _bit_<foo> like for a vax??
 * 		I guess we just don't use them anymore.
 * 	[89/01/09            rvb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  89/01/21  13:33:29  jsb

 * 
 * Revision 2.6  89/01/18  01:18:11  jsb
 * 	Vnode support: define MAXLINK, PMASK and PCATCH.
 * 	[89/01/13            jsb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  88/12/21  14:19:01  mja

 * 
 * Revision 2.4  88/08/24  02:38:21  mwyoung
 * 	Adjusted include file references.
 * 	[88/08/17  02:19:37  mwyoung]
 *
 * 23-May-88  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CMUCS:  Bump maximum user process count to 64 (it is patched
 *	down to the standard 40 on time-sharing systems).
 *	[ V5.1(XF26) ]
 *
 * 20-Apr-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Change to signal macros to allow use of exception signals as
 *	back door ipc.  [XXX]
 *
 * 21-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH: ISSIG() must check for per-thread exit conditions.
 *
 * 17-Sep-87  Robert Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Split up ISSIG() so I can tell if issig() would be called.  This
 *	is neccessary for astcheck which is running at interrupt level,
 *	and for trap() that does now want to acquire/release the
 *	unix_lock twice.
 *
 * 17-Mar-87  David L. Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon :University
 *	MULTIMAX & BALANCE: MAXUPRC -> 100
 *
 * 31-Jan-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	machparam.h was a 4.3 *feature*, so I have changed the include
 *	of machine/param.h back to machine/machparam.h.
 *
 * 29-Jan-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Make tsleep stuff conditional on CMUCS instead of CS_COMPAT.
 *
 * 29-Oct-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Moved INCLUDE_VERSION to h/version.h
 *
 *  1-Oct-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	INCLUDE_VERSION changed to -5 to account for different proc
 *	structure and elimination of task and thread tables.
 *
 * 29-Sep-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Conditionalized which version of <machine/param.h> to get on
 *	CMUCS.  Added separate INCLUDE_VERSION for MACH case.
 *	Rearranged PSEM and PIPC under appropriate conditionals.
 *
 * 18-Sep-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Bumped include version to -4, to account for different
 *	TBL_* constants after merge with Facilities system.
 *	Shouldn't the INCLUDE_VERSION really be in another file?
 *
 *  2-Sep-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Bumped INCLUDE_VERSION to -3, to reflect changes in
 *	"vm/vm_map.h".
 *
 * 23-Aug-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed "machparam.h" reference to "machine/param.h".
 *
 * 27-Jul-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed ROMP to romp.
 *
 * 10-Jun-86  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CMUCS:  Added INCLUDE_VERSION definition.
 *
 * 22-Mar-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Merged VM and Romp versions.
 *
 * 19-Mar-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fixed definitions of the bit manipulation macros (setbit, etc.)
 *	so that their arguments may be of any type (as opposed to having
 *	to be of a single byte length type).
 *
 * 28-Feb-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added defintions of _bit_{set,clear,tst} for romp.
 *
 * 20-Feb-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Spiffed up and included IBM code for Sailboat which handles the
 *	inclusion of signal.h when we are running on the romp
 *	(specifically, not to include it when building locore, or all
 *	hell will break loose).
 *
 * 25-Jan-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Upgraded to 4.3 and increased MAXHOSTNAMELEN to 256 [CMUCS].
 *	Also removed CS_NOFILE.
 *
 * 23-May-85  Glenn Marcy (gm0w) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CS_COMPAT:  Added tsleep() return values from 4.1BSD [V1(1)].
