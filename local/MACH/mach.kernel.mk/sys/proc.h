 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	proc.h,v $
 * Revision 2.10  89/10/11  14:54:00  dlb
 * 	Pass thread to thread_should_halt().
 * 	[88/10/18            dlb]
 * 
 * Revision 2.9  89/03/15  15:59:42  gm0w
 * 	Added pointer to utask to proc structure so that programs
 * 	out-side of the kernel can find it without using the task
 * 	structure.
 * 	[89/03/14            gm0w]
 * 
 * Revision 2.8  89/03/09  22:06:32  rpd
 * 	More cleanup.
 * 
 * Revision 2.7  89/02/27  21:04:05  mrt
 * 	Made p_rmt_seg field in struct proc unconditional.
 * 	[89/02/27            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.6  89/02/25  17:55:23  gm0w
 * 	Got rid of MACH and CMUCS conditionals and all non-MACH code.
 * 	Made CMUCS conditional code true. Make VICE conditionals
 * 	unconditionally false for X75 binary compatibilty, should
 * 	be changed to true.
 * 	[89/02/13            mrt]
 * 
 * Revision 2.5  89/01/30  22:08:17  rpd
 * 	Updated macro definitions to the new style.
 * 	Made variable declarations use "extern".
 * 	[89/01/25  15:22:29  rpd]
 * 
 * Revision 2.4  88/08/24  02:39:19  mwyoung
 * 	Adjusted include file references.
 * 	[88/08/17  02:20:09  mwyoung]
 *
 *  4-May-88  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Document use of p_stat for MACH.
 *
 * 29-Mar-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH: Removed unused variables (whichqs).
 *
 * 11-Apr-88  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Move controlling terminal information to proc structure from
 *	U-area (to provide better handle on disconnecting background
 *	processes from a terminal);  CS_SECURITY => CMUCS.
 *	[ V5.1(XF23) ]
 *
 * 29-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Delinted.
 *
 * 26-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Removed MACH_NOFLOAT.
 *
 * 21-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Check for thread termination condition and return properly
 *	in more places in sig_lock.
 *
 *  9-Dec-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed forced_exit case of sig_lock to call thread_halt_self
 *	for new thread termination logic.
 *
 *  3-Dec-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added second argument to task_dowait.
 *
 * 18-Nov-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Eliminated MACH conditionals.
 *
 * 28-Oct-87  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH_TT: restore definition of SWEXIT to keep ps happy.
 *
 * 16-Oct-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH_TT: Incorporate exit_thread logic in sig_lock() macro.
 *		This replaces and extends core_thread.
 *
 * 25-Sep-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH: added core_thread field to deal with network core dumps.
 *
 * 18-Sep-87  Richard Sanzi (sanzi) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Deleted definition of SOWEFPA, as this condition is no longer
 *	associated with processes, but rather with threads.
 *
 *  4-Sep-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added sig lock for signals and exit.  This frees proc lock for
 *	other uses.
 *
 * 15-May-87  David Black (dlb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH: Added p_stopsig field to record signal that stopped
 *	process.  Can't use p_cursig for this purpose under MACH.
 *
 * 30-Mar-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added a lock to the proc structure to synchronize Unix things in
 *	a multiple thread environement.  This is not conditional on
 *	MACH (but on MACH) so that the same version of ps and friends
 *	will work on both kernels.
 *
 * 06-Mar-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed to use shorts instead of ints for these values that
 *	are really signed chars anyway since its more space efficient
 *	and consistent with the prior fix to p_nice.
 *	[ V5.1(F5) ]
 *
 * 05-Mar-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Make usrpri, pri and nice ints for ROMP due to compiler
 *	difference (this doesn't matter under MACH, but till we run
 *	that everywhere...)
 *
 * 04-Mar-87  Jonathan J. Chew (jjc) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added pointer to proc structure of tracer for Sun.
 *
 * 02-Mar-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Fixed to make the p_nice field a short on the IBM-RT since its
 *	current compiler doesn't provide signed char types and this is
 *	wreaking havoc with high priority processes never getting any
 *	cycles!  This fix is only temporary until a better compiler
 *	becomes the standard.
 *	[ V5.1(F4) ]
 *
 *  7-Feb-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Merge VICE changes -- include vice.h and change to #if VICE.
 *
 * 31-Jan-87  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Eliminate p_wchan for MACH as a check for elimination of all
 *	uses of it.
 *
 * 28-Jan-87  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CMUCS:  added p_logdev field to record controlling device
 *	of top-level logged-in process.
 *	[ V5.1(F1) ]
 *
 * 08-Jan-87  Robert Beck (beck) at Sequent Computer Systems, Inc.
 *	If MACH, declare p_pctcpu as a long and define PCTCPU_SCALE.
 *
 * 31-Dec-86  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Purged all MACH uses of p0br and friends.  Removed fields
 *	that refer to text structure, and removed segment size fields
 *	(p_tsize, p_dsize, p_ssize) that are unused under MACH.
 *	ROMP_FPA should be the next to go (it belongs with the thread info).
 *
 *  2-Dec-86  Jay Kistler (jjk) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	VICE: 1/ added p_rmt_seq field to "proc" struct;
 *	      2/ added SRMT flag;
 *
 * 31-Oct-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Removed include of task/thread header files by using "struct"
 *	instead of typedef.
 *
 * 15-Oct-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Well, as it turns out, the Multimax code actually does want the
 *	Vax versions of p0br and friends for compatibility.  Presumably
 *	these will all go away someday anyway.
 *
 * 14-Oct-86  William Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Changed #ifdef romp #else romp {vax code here} #endif romp to
 *	the (correct) #ifdef vax {vax code here} #endif vax.  This
 *	should NOT be changed back again; we now have more machines than
 *	just the vax and the RT, and I don't think that the Sun and the
 *	Encore want definitions of p_p0br.  It's time to fix the scripts.
 *
 * 30-Sep-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added backpointers from proc to task and thread.
 *
 * 24-Sep-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added include of <sys/types.h> to pick up uid_t, etc.
 *
 *  6-Sep-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added include of <sys/time.h> for non-KERNEL compiles.
 *
 * 20-Jul-86  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added include of "time.h" to satisfy "struct itimerval"
 *	reference.
 *
 *  7-Jul-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	romp: removed p_sid0 and p_sid1 (since this info is stored in
 *	the pmap and is no longer used).  Conditionalized
 *	SPTECHG on vax and added SOWEFPA in same bit on romp w/FPA.
 *	Conditionalized p0br and p1br on vax.
 *
 * 25-Jan-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Upgraded to 4.3.
 *
 * 18-Feb-86  Bill Bolosky (bolosky) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Added definition of p_sid0 and p_sid1 in proc structure for
 *	IBM-RT under switch romp.
 *
 *  3-Sep-85  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH:  Added SACTIVE flag to signify that a process is actually
 *	running on a cpu.
 *
 * 25-Aug-85  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Allow recursive includes.
 *
 * 25-May-85  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Upgraded from 4.1BSD.  Carried over changes below.
 *	[V1(1)]
 *
 * 20-Aug-81  Mike Accetta (mja) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	CMUCS:  added SXONLY bit definition to flag execute only
 *	processes;
