 * HISTORY
 * $Log:	subr_rmap.c,v $
 * Revision 2.2  92/01/03  20:33:44  dbg
 * 	Fix bug in rminit: clear the entire rmap.
 * 	[91/10/25            dbg]
 * 
 * Revision 2.1  89/08/03  15:31:19  rwd
 * Created.
 * 
 * 11-Aug-88  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	MACH_KERNEL version.
 *
 * 29-Mar-88  Michael Young (mwyoung) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Don't compile rmprint.
 *
 * 17-Dec-86  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Remove use of text.h for MACH_VM.
 *
 * 14-Nov-86  David Golub (dbg) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Disable the use of MACH VM maps for the moment.  These resource
 *	maps are often used at interrupt level, and use of MACH VM maps
 *	would require that the map entry zone be interrupt-proof.
 *
 * 25-Jan-86  Avadis Tevanian (avie) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Upgraded to 4.3.
 *
 * 22-Feb-85  Robert V Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	No change this time, but we have had another problem like  5-Oct.
 *	The problem is we are doing an rmfree to add stuff to the user
 *	process shared memory map.  We init the map so the first cell says
 *	0,0, the ensuing cells contain non zero junk if the map was freed by
 *	shmpfree.  Adding a new element clobbers the zero cell, but MUST lob
 *	a zero into the succeeding cell. Thus the whole map is restored to
 *	some bogus state.  I am fixing this for now by making shmpfree zero
 *	the map.  I think the problem should be solved here instead.
 *
 *  5-Oct-84  Robert V Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Change the sentinel check when merging an entry with the next to
 *	check the size == 0 rather than the addr == 0
 *
 * 18-Sep-84  Robert V Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	On a badrmfree, print name and address of map
 *
 * 29-Aug-84  Robert V Baron (rvb) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	added rmprint for printing a resource map

/*
 * Resource map handling routines.
 *
 * A resource map is an array of structures each
 * of which describes a segment of the address space of an available
 * resource.  The segments are described by their base address and
 * length, and sorted in address order.  Each resource map has a fixed
 * maximum number of segments allowed.  Resources are allocated
 * by taking part or all of one of the segments of the map.
 *
 * Returning of resources will require another segment if
 * the returned resources are not adjacent in the address
 * space to an existing segment.  If the return of a segment
 * would require a slot which is not available, then one of
 * the resource map segments is discarded after a warning is printed.
 * Returning of resources may also cause the map to collapse
 * by coalescing two existing segments and the returned space
 * into a single segment.  In this case the resource map is
 * made smaller by copying together to fill the resultant gap.
 *
 * N.B.: the current implementation uses a dense array and does
 * not admit the value ``0'' as a legal address, since that is used
 * as a delimiter.
 */

 * and to be called ``name'', which we print if
 * the slots become so fragmented that we lose space.

 * starting at addr.
