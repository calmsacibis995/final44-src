This directory contains a modified version of the program `xpr'
from the Version 10 Release 3 distribution of X to allow it to drive a
PostScript device (such as the Apple LaserWriter).
See documentation, include files, make files, etc. in the original
X distribution for more information.
See the comment at the head of xpr.c for details about how it differs
from the distributed version.

	This directory was moved from orpheus:/u1/X/NRFPT/xpr to 
orpheus:/u1/X11/clients/xpr_lw on 6-4-87 for use as the foundation of
X11 xpr and xdpr.  The files in this directory are modified versions of
the origionals, for use with X11.
