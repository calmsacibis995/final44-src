## fas7.pi -  
## Test requirements:
##   Test that fill area set attributes ,which are set in a parent 
##   structure, are inherited by a child structure.
##   individual fill area set attributes :
##      edge type:
##      edge width scale factor:
##      edge colour index:
##      fill area interior style:
##      fill area interior colour index:
