Most of the PostScript files in this tree have been compressed to save space.
If your system does not have the "uncompress" program, compile the sources
in the directory util/compress/.  Names of compressed files end in ".Z".

Also, please beware that, due to a bug in our PostScript generation software,
printing the PostScript files as-is may cause the page numbers at the bottoms
of pages to not get printed on certain printers.  To get the contents more
reasonably centered on the page, use the sed script provided as the file
"psfix.sed" in this directory.

For example:

zcat BDF/bdf.PS.Z | sed -f psfix.sed | lpr
