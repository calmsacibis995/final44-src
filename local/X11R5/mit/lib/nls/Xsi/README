This directory contains locales definitions written in ASCII text.
In the current implementation, the locale file specified by setlocale()
is loaded.
Each file name is also the locale name(except files README, nls.dir, nls.alias).

nls.dir     -- specifies which locales should be loaded.
nls.alias   -- alias

Locales:

C              -- ANSI C locale, defaul locale of system.
ja_JP.jis7 *   -- Japanese 7-bit JIS encoding
ja_JP.jis8     -- Japanese 8-bit JIS encoding
ja_JP.mscode   -- Japanese MS-code(SJIS) encoding
ja_JP.ujis     -- Japanese UJIS encoding(from EUC)
ja_JP.pjis     -- Used offen in Japan by historical reose 
lt_LN.bit7     -- Latin-1 7 bits encoding
lt_LN.bit8     -- Latin-1 8 bits encoding
ko_KR.euc      -- Korean encoding(from EUC)
zh_CN.ugb **   -- Chinese UGB encoding(from EUC)
zh_TW.big5     -- Taiwan BIG-5 encoding.
wr_WR.ct ***   -- Compound Text encoding that specifies which
                  languages would be possibly used.

Notes *: This encoding actually is an extension of CT because only
         different escape sequence for Japanese.

     **: The name UGB is called by myself.  There maybe no the name
         in China yet.(GB stands for national standard pronunciated
         in Chinese PinYin -- GuoBiao;  UGB for Unixnized GB)

    ***: This locale is an old method for CT encoding.  In later
         it would be canceled.  System will support open-ended CT
         encoding for any language.
