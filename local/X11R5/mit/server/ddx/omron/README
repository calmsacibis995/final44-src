Xluna -- Omron Xserver Sample Implementation		June 26, 1991


This version of the Omron X11 drivers uses ../mi, ../mfb to support
the following configurations:

	Machine Type		Operating System

	LUNA			UniOS-B 4.3BSD		
	LUNA-II			UniOS-Mach 2.5		
	LUNA-88K		UniOS-Mach 2.5		

The following configurations are not supported:

	Machine Type		Operating System

	LUNA			UniOS-U	
	LUNA-FS			UniOS-U	
	LUNA-II			UniOS-U

The cfb code is written for packed pixeles, but currently Omron's framebuffers
are planewise, so this version of the Omron X11 drivers supports only monochrome displays. 
 
Some older versions of Omron's operating systems require two special defines 
to be specified when compiling the server. These defines are
 -DUNUSE_SIGIO_SIGNAL and -DUNUSE_DRV_TIME. These defines will be set 
automatically if the correct operating system version is specified in
config/luna.cf. Please set the values for OSMajorVerion and OSMinorVersion in
luna.cf to correspond to the version listed in /etc/motd.

Omron's source code has an additional define that controls the KANA key on the
Japanese keyboard. If -DUSE_KANA_SWITCH is specified, the KANA key is
interpreted as XK_Mode_switch and registered as mod5.
  
All development and testing of this version of X was done using the GNU C
compiler. It is therefore recommended that gcc be used when compiling all
source code. If your system does not have gcc, please obtain copy from Omron.
