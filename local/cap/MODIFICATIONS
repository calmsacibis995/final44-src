The following is an (incomplete) list of the modifications from CAP
Distribution 4 to CAP Distribution 5.

The general change are:
  o various directories have been reorganized.  The major ones are:
    doc - documentation, man - manual pages, samples - sample
    programs, applications - heavily used programs (at Columbia), 
    lib - libraries, and etc - support programs. 

  o While a generic Makefile is included, a "os specific" makefile
    generation facility is included and should now be used.

We do not list bug fixes below, only major changes in functionality.

In samples, the various programs now use a define to find cap.printers
allowing it to be relocated from etc.  In addition, look has been
revised to make its operation easier and renamed to atlook to prevent
naming conflicts (looks => atlooklws, and pinger => atpinger)
