	AUFS - AppleTalk to Unix File Server

	o RELEASE NOTES
	o Aufs, version 3.00, Feb. 1988

Introduction
------------

Aufs provides file service for a Mac client running AppleShare
software.  Aufs implements the AppleTalk Filing Protocol, as specified
by protocol version 1.1, February 17, 1987.

Though this version has been extensively tested, but definitely
contain bugs - it is far to big not to.  It does not incorporate all
AFP 1.1 features.

Aufs is currently being developed and tested under a modified Ultrix
2.0 system.

MAJOR CHANGES since Version 2.0:

Here's the big one: we finally realized that the .ADeskTop, .IDeskTop
and .finderinfo files are NOT written in network order.  This means
you can't transport directly between machines with different byte
orders!  (Not tar, dump, or NFS).  Aufs version 3 will destroy the old
desktop files.  Aufs version 3 will also rewrite the old .finderinfo
files when it sees them.  To ensure things are okay, rebuild your
desktop.

Accepts .afpvols if no afpvols.

Provision has now been made to handle international character sets or
rather "ascii"s that are different from what most people in the U.S.
see.  The idea (and tables) come from Dan Sahlin of the Swedish
Institute of Computer Science.

Turning on SMART_FINDERINFO in afpudb.c will yield more information;
however, it is unix variant (BSD) dependent and slows things down
considerably.

Simple minded shutdown mechanism added.

Disallow "." and ".." as file names.

Kinetics Box too slow code dropped in favor of settable values.

Update to use sun quota system properly
