High:


Medium:
Setting directory owner is a bad idea under unix?  (Allow under SysV)
do something to the DT if the magic number is wrong

Low:
make xbin do the correct file names and finder info format.
Add OpenDir, CloseDir
Make conflicting aufs processes handle conflicts with .finderinfo,
  desktop for systems without flock, lockf 

Clean:

run lint on the whole mess and get rid of any unused routines
cleanup interface
system admin manual page, user manual page
modules needing init should be called from InitServer(), name Init_xxx();

Bugs:

Folders gets locked/in use and can't get rid of it.

Done 

4/1/87 Bill - move afperr() from aufs into (new) afperr.c do char *afperr() 
4/1/87 Bill - error codes prefixed aeX to prevent conflict with other codes.
4/1/87 Bill - clean up command line args/help
4/2/87 Bill - Icon database resides in each volumes root directory
4/2/87 Bill - Make tilde available in path name on volumes in afpvols file.
4/2/87 Bill - Volume passwords.
4/2/87 Bill - Clean up os interface some.
4/2/87 Bill - don't show desktop files...
4/2/87 Bill - APPL database (afpdt) mostly working
4/3/87 Bill - default finder information should have TEXT...
4/3/87 Bill - if no finderinfo, item is locked, comment is "Unix created.."
4/3/87 Bill - Comment strings (afpdt).
4/3/87 Bill - write returns bad offset on return (cck fix)
4/3/87 Bill - abmisc2 should be moved into other ab modules (cck did most) 
4/4/87 Bill - fpenumerate should use the max replysize instead of current hack
4/4/87 Bill - fpenumerate does not count an item when request bitmap is 0.
4/4/87 Bill - OSFileDirInfo doesn't consider bitmap, does unnecessary work
4/4/87 Bill - SetFileParms, SetDirParms, SetFileDirParms
4/4/87 Bill - SetDirParms for access mode
4/4/87 Bill - move/rename for dirs needs to modify IDir structure better!
4/4/87 Bill - volmodified should be set in more places.
4/4/87 Bill - APPL information should be written to disk.
4/4/87 Bill - some routines are doing packing by hand, they should be modified.
4/4/87 Bill - packing routines searches a table for AFPCmd... chuck it
4/6/87 B&C  - name mapping... disallow characters which confuse unix.
4/6/87 CCK  - add spawning on login.  Debug server prevents this.
4/16/87 Bill - implement FPCopyFile
4/16/87 Bill - use a master afpvols files; switch is -V
4/16/87 CCK - log login/logout to a log file.
4/16/87 Bill - make very quite if debugging turned off.
4/16/87 Bill - allow newlinechar in read
4/16/87 Bill - see if most OS error codes are translated ok.
4/16/87 Bill - using the path name for volume problems; use component name 
4/16/87 Bill - move table out of afpcmd.c
4/16/87 Bill - build a combined common header file... keep others seperate
6/24/87 cck - Add SetForkParms and allow setfiledirparms to set fork lengths.
		bunch of other changes too.
6/24/87 cck - Setting directory group forks off the chgrp program if neces.
6/26/87 cck - allow guest login, cmd line option to set guest id?
7/22/87 cck - use citi mechanism for converting files - change default
		file type to TEXT, creator "unix".  Files like this will
		have lf mapped to cr on read and vice versa on write
8/01/87 cck - time conversion is off because mac does not use AFP
		time - only in Appleshare verison 1.0
 
1/88 - Fix problems with byte order in .ADeskTop, .IDeskTop and
.finderinfo files.
