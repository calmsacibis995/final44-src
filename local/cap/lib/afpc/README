    afpc.c - primary library 
    afpc.mss - documentation for afpc.c
    afpcc.c - set of "easy" access routines (not documented)
    probs - noted problems with appleshare client

The afpc libraries are consist of two major parts.  The first is a set
of routines (afpc) that adheres closely to the Apple standards for
argument passing, etc.  The second is a set of routines (afpcc) that
attempts to simplify using the above mentioned routines.  afpc.mss
shows the structures and special calling conventions for routines in
(afpc) - be wary of this file - it is out of date.

Note: if libafp has des routines encoded you will be able to use
randnum exchange in login sequences - otherwise not.

The afpc libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib/libafpc.a.  See
the samples directory for examples of how to load or how to program
using these libraries.

These routines are braindamaged and unmaintainable the way there are
done.  They really need to be rewritten.
