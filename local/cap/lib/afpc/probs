Revised: Aug. 6, 1987

Comments apply to AppleShare version 1.0, Jan. 12, 1987 and protocol
specification "AppleTalk File Protocol (AFP) Engineering Technical
Notes, Protocol Version 1.1, February 17, 1987"

Additional comments apply to AppleShare version 1.1.

FPAddAPPL packet display says we are to send volid in a request - this
doesn't seem right - probably should be DTRefNum.

AppleShare seems to use Mac time, with earliest time at 0.  This is at
|odds with the specification.  This seems to be fixed in AppleShare 1.1.

At least for FPEnumerate AppleShare client seems to reverse creation
and modification dates.  Either the spec or code is out of sync.
Probably the code since the AppleShare server seems to get them in the
|correct order.  This may be fixed in AppleShare 1.1.

Spec does not make clear how FPAddIcon is to proceed - it simply says
"The bitmap is sent to the server in a subsequent intermediate
exchange of the Session Protocol packets".

SPAttention calls from the server are not documented - not sure if you
think this should be part of the specification, but the calls should
be documented.  From observations, we can guess that some number <=4
of the high order bits of the attention code define the event.  For
example, (0x => hex) 0x8xxx seems to mean server is going down in xxx
minutes unless xxx == fff in which case it indicates that a shutdown
has been cancelled.
