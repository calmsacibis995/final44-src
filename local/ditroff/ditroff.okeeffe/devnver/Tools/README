The files in this directory are tools for making emulators for 
the Harris typesetter.  

On the Harris typesetter, the data for each of the characters 
for each of the fonts is stored as a binary stream.  This stream 
is fed first through a `huffman decoder', which produces output 
(for each character) in the form of `run lengths'.  This data in 
turn is fed through `the predictor', which produces output, 
essentially in bitmaps.

Our emulation goes through almost the same process, except that
we do scaling to the various pointsizes before me make the bitmaps,
and for this purpose we have an intermediate form called `rects
files', which encode the character as a union of disjoint 
rectangles.  This is done because it makes the scaling easier.

The versatec driver only cares about the existence of the final
bitmap files, so the prior forms (rle files and rects files)
do not need to be maintained, as they and the bitmap files
can be regenerated from the raw Harris disk.  But it doesn't
hurt to keep them around.

Currently the directories for the data are as follows:

	/hfonts/harris.disk	- the raw harris disk
	/hfonts/rles/<fontno>-<ms>/<charno>.rle
				- the rle files for each char 
				  in each font.
	/hfonts/rects/<fontno>-<ms>.rect
				- the rect file for each font
	/hfonts/<fontno>/<pointsize>
				- the bitmap files for each
				  font in each pointsize.

The <ms> is the mastersize of the font as stored on the Harris
disk.  <pointsize> is the pointsizes the versatec driver
expects to find.

The programs are:

	cdata <fontno>-<ms> ..

Extract the rle data from the disk for the requested font
and size, and put it into the rle files.  This program must
be run from /hfonts/rles as the working directory, and the
<fontno>-<ms> directory must already be created.

	prects [-d] [-o<file>] <fontno>-<ms>

Converts the run length files for a font into a rects file.  
<fontno>-<ms> selects the directory to work on, and -o<file> 
specifies the output file (by default it is <fontno>-<ms>.rect
on the same directory).  [-d] runs debugging mode.  Like
cdata, this must be run from /hfonts/rles.

	bitmaps [-d] <fontno>-<pointsize> ...

Converts the rects files to bitmaps files for the requested
font, scaled to the requested pointsize.  bitmaps reads
rects files from /hfonts/rects and writes bitmap files to
/hfonts/<fontno>/<pointsize>  (and so, unlike cdata and
prects, you don't have to be in /hfonts/rles to run it).
The <fontno> directory does have to exist, however. -d 
turns on debugging mode.


There are also couple of programs which get information
out of the raw disk:

	checkdisk [-a]

Gives info about the disk, including a list of font numbers.
With -a, more info about the fonts are printed.

	fntinfo <fntname-sz> ...

Gives in depth information about the requested fonts. (The
same as cdata, but doesn't extract files.)
