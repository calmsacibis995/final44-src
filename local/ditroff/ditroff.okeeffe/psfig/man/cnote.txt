             POSTSCRIPT Structuring Conventions





     For POSTSCRIPT files to be proper, they must be  struc-
tured according to ``The POSTSCRIPT File Structuring Conven-
tion'',  as  defined  by  Adobe  Systems  (the  creator   of
POSTSCRIPT)   At  a  bare  minimum,  the  first  line  in  a
POSTSCRIPT file must start with the characters ``%!''.  _N_o_t_e
_t_h_a_t _M_a_c_D_r_a_w (at least the current version) _d_o_e_s _n_o_t _s_u_p_p_o_r_t
_t_h_i_s, so some programs (notably psfig and FigTeX) may reject
Macintosh  files as invalid. The solution to this is simple-
add a line of the form ``%!'' to the beginning of the  file.
Psfig and FigTeX users will also have to add a ``%%Bounding-
Box:'' comment just below the ``%!''.

     So, a sample file from MacDraw may have to  be  changed
from

        md begin
        T 32 760 100 72 72 psu
        ...

to:

        %!
        %%BoundingBox:  _a _b _c _d
        md begin
        T 32 760 100 72 72 psu
        ...

where (_a,_b) is the lower left coordinate and  (_c,_d)  is  the
upper right coordiate of the figure's bounding box expressed
in points (72 to the  inch),  relative  to  the  lower  left
corner  of  the page. Again, you probably only need to worry
about a bounding box if you are using psfig or FigTeX.
