ditroff.frag

This code fragment should be added to t10.c to allow \X to center properly.

The two lines marked should be added to the ptout0() fcn.

==================================================================


psdit.c.patch

This patch to psdit (from version 2 transcript) allows it to
accept the special commands generated by ditroff (which are used by psfig)

The fontheight change fixes a small bug in the way psdit handles explicit 
height changes from ditroff.

run:

% ed psdit.c.old < psdit.c.patch

ed should print out:
30767
32131
and psdit.c.new will be created.

The file psdit.c.frag contains these patches in contextual context

===========================================

psdit.pro.frag:

this shows the first n lines of the file psdit.pro, add everything between
the comment "%% Psfig additions" and "%% end XMOD additions"

good luck
