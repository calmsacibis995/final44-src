This release contains the sources, binaries, various support
utilities, and documentation for the following programs:
.(l
.ta \w'gremlin:\0\0\0\0\0\0'u
ditroff:	device independent troff
eqn:	program for typesetting mathematics
gremlin:	interactive graphical editor that runs on a terminal & AED
grn:	gremlin \(-> ditroff preprocessor
ideal:	advanced graphics typesetting language
pic:	simple graphics typesetting language
refer:	bibliographic data base preprocessor
tbl:	table typesetting program
output filters (drivers) for Versatec, Rotated Versatec, and Imagen printers and lineprinter
SUN workstation previewer
.)l
Each program is in a separate subdirectory, with
README files giving further instructions for the various programs.
These programs run well on VAXen.  They will run, if recompiled,
on SUNs (except for the Versatec output filters, due to byte-swapping
inconsistencies).  Some of them will NOT run unmodified on PDP\-11s.  No
comment is made on their usefulness for any other machine.
.uh "Installation Instructions"
.pp
The tape is written in Unix ``tar'' program format, 1600 BPI, 20
blocks per record.  There are about 14 Mbytes of stuff on
the tape.  Installing the sources on a VAX running 4.2 BSD Unix
is relatively easy.  First, create a directory ``ditroff'' in the
source directory \- /usr/src/local or /usr/src on most machines.
Change directory into that directory and load the information
from the tape with the command \fItar x\fP.
.PP
You should look at the Makefile in the root of this distribution for
some of the setup parameters, and edit them accordingly.  Run \fImake\fP
and check for errors, then run \fImake install\fP.  Root priviledges
are probably necessary to run the install since it writes into
directories which are most likely protected.  See the
README file in the gremlin subdirectory for further instructions on
installing gremlin.
.PP
There are a few things that the various programs and utilities expect
to have around.  The \-me macros expect /usr/lib/me to contain individual
pieces of the macros.  The Versatec output filters and vfontinfo program
expect to find the font files in /usr/lib/vfont (in vfont format) \-
more information is contained in their manual pages.  The Imagen
filter also needs its RST font files in a particular directory.
The vfont font files are contained on this release, but we don't have
permission to distribute imagen's fonts.  There is one RST font file
(bracket) included, which has most of the bracket-building characters
in it.  The font files are not installed by the Makefile because
of their large size.
.PP
As sent, \fImake install\fP places the binary programs into /usr/local,
most libraries and data into /usr/local/lib, and manual pages into
/usr/man/manl.  This is where
the programs will expect them to be.  If you wish to change those
directories you can do so in the main ``Makefile'' and then recompile \-
it's recommended that \fImake clean\fP be run after changing any defines
in the main ``Makefile''.  The above procedure installs everything but the
device filters for final output.  The ditroff command itself sends
its output to \fIlpr\fP, which is expected to send the output to the
appropriate device filter.
.PP
You will need to make additions and/or changes to \fIlpr\fP to
make it handle ditroff output properly.  This usually involves changing
the program that gets run at output generation time, or adding an
option and filter to handle ditroff.  If you don't wish to use
lpr you will have to modify \fIditroff\fP to send its output to
the driver by another method.  The flags that ditroff sends to
lpr may not match those in use on your system, so some modification
may be needed there, too.
.PP
All the drivers in this release take ditroff input and write
to standard out.  The lpr method of driving the printers sets up
a connection from standard output of the filter to the input of
the appropriate printer (or the device driver for that printer).
That connection will have to be made to the device in another manner
if lpr is not used (possibly having the ``filter'' program open the
device directly).
.PP
One last caveat:  these programs are set up for the environment
at UC Berkeley, where there are three main output devices; ip
(imagen), va (varian) and vp (versatec).  Many of the macros,
utilities, pre-processors and post-processors have these devices'
names built into them.  As many of these dependencies as was
feasible have been removed or parameterized.  Some changes will
still be necessary for a new environment.
