\*(id is a programming language to be used for describing
pictures.
.PP
The main use of \*(id is as a preprocessor to \*(tf,
so that pictures and text may reside in the same
file and be typeset together.
This manual contains many examples of this use of \*(id.
.PP
\*(id proper produces device-independent descriptions
of pictures, so pictures may also be displayed through
the
.UX
plot filters.

This document describes how to use the existing
implementation of \*(id.

This document describes how to use
the existing implementation of \*(id
and treats several examples in depth.
