.NH 1
Commands to Control \*(id Processing
.PP
These commands affect decisions that must be made during  the processing of
an \*(id program.
They should appear after the .IS delimiter,
each on a separate line beginning with three dots.
.NH 2
Forgetting a Box
.P1
\&...forget $(boxname)*$
.P2
.PP
All box definitions except the definition of $main$ survive across
\&.IS\(em.IE boundaries.
If you won't need a box again, and memory space is tight, you can
use the $forget$ command to reclaim the space its definition requires.
Because of implementation deficiencies, at most five names of boxes may
appear on one $forget$ line.
There is no way to remember the $main$.
.NH 2
Angle Processing
.P1
\&...degrees
.P2
.P1
\&...radians
.P2
.PP
\*(id expects angles\(emarguments to $roman "cis"$ and the result of $angle$\(em\!
to appear in degrees,
unless it was invoked with the \-r option on the command line,
in which case it expects angles in radians.
These two commands may be used to switch back and forth between
degrees and radians.
Only one convention may be used within a single \*(id program,
that is between .IS and .IE.
.NH 2
Including Files
.P1
\&...libfile $(file)*$
\&...include $(file)*$
.P2
.PP
The first command directs that the named library files be interpolated so
that their box definitions may be used.
The second is a way to include one's own files.
The following library files are available:
.IT arc ,
.IT arrow ,
.IT circle ,
.IT dash ,
.IT rect ,
and
.IT wavy.
