.H 1 "Command-Line Options"
.H 2 "New options"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI \fB\-T\fP\fIname\fP
The
.B \-T
option may be used to specify the output device.
The default
output device is defined locally.
.LI \fB\-F\fP\fIdir\fP
The
.B \-F
option causes font information to be accessed from 
the directory
.BI dir name
instead of the default
.BI /usr/lib/font/dev name
(where
.I name
is the default output device.
.LI \fB\-z\fP
Suppress formatted output.
Only diagnostics and messages from
.B tm
requests will occur.
.LE
.H 2 "Deleted options"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI ###
The options
.BR \-p ,
.BR \-g ,
and
.BI + n
have been eliminated.
.H 1 "Requests"
.H 2 "New requests"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI \fB.ab\fP\fI#\|text\fP
Prints
.I text
on the diagnostic output (normally, the terminal)
and terminates without further processing.
If
.I text
is missing, the message ``User Abort'' is printed.
This request does
.I not
cause a break.
The output buffer is flushed.
.LI \fB.cf\fP#\|\fIfile\fP
The
.B cf
command copies the contents of
.I file
into the
.SM TROFF
output file at this point, uninterpreted.
Havoc ensues unless the motions in the file
restore current horizontal and vertical position.
.LI \fB.!\fP\fI#\|cmd#\|args\fP
The
.SM UNIX
command
.I cmd
is executed.
The standard input for
.I cmd
is closed.
The command
.B sy
is a synonym for
.BR ! .
.LI \fB.pi\fP#\|\fIcmd\fP
The
.B pi
command causes the output of 
.SM TROFF
to be piped into
.I cmd
instead of appearing on the standard output,
as in
.SM NROFF .
.LE
.H 2 "Modified requests"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI \fB.ad\fP\fI#\|c\fP
The adjustment type indicator
.I c
may now also be a number obtained from the
.B .j
register;
see Section#4 below.
.LI \fB.ft\fP\fI#\|F\fP
The
.B ft
command causes the font
.I F
to be loaded on font position 0
(which is in all other ways inaccessible)
if the font exists and is not currently mounted
by default or by a
.B fp
command.
The font must be still or again in position 0
when the line is printed.
.LI \fB.so\fP\fI#\|file\fP
The contents of
.I file
will be interpolated at the point the
.B so
request is encountered.
Previously,
if an
.B so
was encountered inside a macro, the interpolation was delayed
until the input level returned to the file level
(i.e., at least until the end of the macro).
.LI \fB.li\fP
The
.B li
request has been eliminated.
.LE
.H 1 "New Escape Sequences"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI \fB\eD\(fml\fP\fI#dh#dv\fP\fB\(fm\fP
Draw a line from the current position by
.IR dh,dv .
.LI \fB\eD\(fmc\fP\fI#d\fP\fB\(fm\fP
Draw a circle of diameter
.I d
with left side at the current position.
.LI \fB\eD\(fme\fP\fI#d1#d2\fP\fB\(fm\fP
Draw an ellipse of diameters
.I d1
and
.I d2
with left side at current position.
.LI \fB\eD\(fma\fP\fI#dh1#dv1#dh2#dv2\fP\fB\(fm\fP
.br
Draw an arc from current position to
.IR dh1+dh2 ,
.IR dv1+dv2 ,
with center at
.I dh1,dv1
from current position.
.LI \fB\eD\(fm\(ap\fP\fI#dh1#dv1#dh2#dv2#...\fP\fB\(fm\fP
.br
Draw a B-spline from current position by
.IR dh1,dv1 ,
then by
.IR dh2,dv2 ,
then ...#.
.LI \fB\e\^g\fP\fIx\fP,\fB\e\^g(\fP\fIxx\fP
Return the
format of register
.I x #or# xx ;
return nothing if
.I x #( xx )
has not yet been referenced.
Can be saved and used later as the second argument of
the
.B af
request
(q.v.)
to restore the previous format of a register.
.LI \fB\e\^H\(fm\fP\fIn\fP\fB\(fm\fP
Character heights are set to
.I n
points, without changing widths.
A height of the form
.I \(+-n
is an increment on the current point size;
a height of zero restores the height to the point size.
.LI \fB\e\^S\(fm\fP\fIn\fP\fB\(fm\fP
Output is slanted
.I n
degrees.
.I n
may be negative.
.LE
.H 1 "New Predefined Number Registers"
.VL 1i 3n
.LI \fB$$\fP
Read-only.
Contains the process-id of the
.SM TROFF
process.
.LI \fB.L\fP
Read-only.
Contains the current line-spacing parameter,
i.e., the value of the argument of the most recent
.B ls
request.
.LI \fB.P\fP
Read-only.
Contains the value 1 if the current page is being printed, and 0
otherwise, e.g., if the current page does
.I not
appear in the
.B \-o
option list.
.LI \fB.R\fP
Count of number registers that remain available for use.
.LI \fB.b\fP
Emboldening factor of the current font,
as set by the
.B bd
command.
.LI \fB.j\fP
Read-only.
Indicates the current adjustment mode and type.
Can be saved and used later as the argument to
the
.B ad
request (q.v.)
to restore a previous adjustment mode.
.LI \fB.k\fP
Read-only.
Contains the horizontal size of the text portion
.RI ( not
including the size of the current indent, if any)
of the current, partially-collected
.I output
line,
if any, in the current environment.
.LI \fBc.\fP
Provides general register access to the input line-number in the current
input file.
Contains the same value as the read-only
.B .c
register.
.LI \fB.T\fP
Contains the name of the
.SM TROFF
output device, e.g.,
.IR aps .
This is a string, not a number register,
so it is accessed as
.BR \e*(.T .
.LE
.H 1 "Other Important Changes"
.AL
.LI
The conditionally accepted part of an
.B ie
or
.B if
request is now
completely ignored
if the test fails, rather than being read in copy mode.
.LI
Transparent mode with
.B \e!\&
has been fixed so that transparent output actually appears
in the output.
.LI
The
.B hp
number register has been eliminated.
.LE
