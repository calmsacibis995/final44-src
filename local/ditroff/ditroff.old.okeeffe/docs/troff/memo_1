Introduction
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are text processors under
the \s-1UNIX\s+1\(dg Time-Sharing System [1]
.fn
\(dg UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.
.ef
that format text for typewriter-like terminals and
for a phototypesetter, respectively.
They accept lines of text interspersed with lines of
format control information and
format the text into a printable, paginated document
having a user-designed style.
\*(NR and \*(TR offer
unusual freedom in document styling,
including:
arbitrary style headers and footers;
arbitrary style footnotes;
multiple automatic sequence numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc;
multiple column output;
dynamic font and point-size control;
arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point;
and
a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and
line drawing functions.
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are highly compatible with each other and it is almost always
possible to prepare input acceptable to both.
Conditional input is provided that enables
the user to embed input expressly destined for either program.
\*(NR can prepare output directly for a variety of terminal types and
is capable of utilizing the full resolution of each terminal.
.pg
.ftB
Usage
.pg
The general form of invoking \*(NR (or \*(TR) at \s-1UNIX\s+1 command level is:
.x1
nroff  \fIoptions  files\fR	      or
troff  \fIoptions  files\fR
.x2
where \fIoptions\fR represents any of a number of option arguments
and \fIfiles\fR represents the list of files containing the document
to be formatted.
An argument consisting of a single minus (\fB\-\fR) is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
If no file names are given input is taken from the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:

.bt
	\fB\-o\fIlist\fR	\
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in \fIlist\fR,
which consists of comma-separated numbers and number ranges.
A number range has the form \fIN\-M\fR
and means pages \fIN\fR through \fIM;\fR
a initial \fI\-N\fR means
from the beginning to page \fIN;\fR and a final \fIN\-\fR means
from \fIN\fR to the end.
.bt
	\fB\-n\fIN\fR	Number first generated page \fIN\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-s\fIN\fR	Stop every \fIN\fR pages.
\*(NR will halt prior to every \fIN\fR pages (default \fIN\fR=1)
to allow paper loading or
changing, and will resume upon receipt of a new-line.
\*(TR will stop the phototypesetter every \fIN\fR pages,
produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and will resume after the phototypesetter \s-1START\s+1 button is pressed.
See \(sc1.2 of the Addendum for additional details.
.bt
	\fB\-m\fIname\fR	Prepends the macro file
\fB\(slusr\(sllib\(sltmac.\fIname\fR
to the input \fIfiles\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-r\fIaN\fR	The number register
whose (one-character) name is \fIa\fR is set to \fIN\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-i\fR	Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.bt
	\fB\-q\fR	\
Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the \fBrd\fR request.

.ftI
.bd I 3

.bt
	\fB\-T\fIname\fR	Specifies
the name of the output terminal type.
Currently defined names are \fB37\fR for the (default)
\s-1\fITELETYPE\fR\s+1\^\(rg Model\ 37,
\fBtn300\fR for the \s-1GE\s+1 TermiNet\ 300 (or any terminal without half-line
capabilities),
\fB300\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1\ 300,
\fB300s\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1\ 300s,
and
\fB450\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1\ 450;
\fB300-12\fP, \fB300s-12\fP, and \fB450-12\fP, respectively,
are used to print in 12-pitch (12 characters per inch)
on the three \s-1DASI\s+1 terminals.
.bt
	\fB\-e\fR	\
Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted
lines, using full terminal resolution.

currently busy.

	\fB\-b\fR	\*(TR will report whether the phototypesetter
is busy or available.
No text processing is done.

.pg
Each option is invoked as a separate argument;
for example:
.x1
nroff  \-o4,8\-10  \-T300\-12  \-mabc  file1  file2
.x2
requests formatting of pages 4, 8, 9, and 10 of the document contained in files
named \fBfile1\fR and \fBfile2\fR,
specifies the output terminal as a \s-1DASI\s+1\ 300 in 12-pitch,
and invokes the macro package \fBabc\fR.
.pg
Various pre- and postprocessors are available for use with \*(NR and \*(TR.
These include
the equation preprocessors \s-1NEQN\s+1 and \s-1EQN\s+1 [2]
(for \*(NR and \*(TR respectively),
the table-construction preprocessor \s-1TBL\s+1 [3],
and the constant-width preprocessor \s-1CW\s+1 [1].
A reverse-line postprocessor \s-1COL\s+1 [1]
is available for multiple-column \*(NR output on terminals without reverse-line ability;
\s-1COL\s+1 expects the \s-1\fITELETYPE\fR\s+1 Model\ 37
escape sequences that \*(NR produces by default.
4014 [1]
is a \s-1\fITELETYPE\fR\s+1 Model\ 37-simulator postprocessor for printing
\*(NR output on a Tektronix 4014.
\s-1TC\s+1 [1]
is phototypesetter-simulator postprocessor
for \*(TR that produces an approximation of phototypesetter output
on a Tektronix 4014.
For example, in:
.x1
tbl  \fIfiles\fR  \(bv  eqn  \(bv  troff  \-t  \fIoptions\fR  \(bv  tc
.x2
the first \(bv indicates the piping of
\s-1TBL\s+1's output to \s-1EQN\s+1's input;
the second the piping of \s-1EQN\s+1's output to \*(TR's input;
and the third indicates the piping of \*(TR's output to \s-1TC\s+1.
\s-1GCAT\s+1 [1] can be used to send \*(TR (\fB\-g\fR) output to
the Murray Hill Computation Center.
