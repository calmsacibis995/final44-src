 *	This routine converts tilde notation into standard directory names.

 *	Results:
 *	If the conversion was done successfully, then TRUE is returned.
 *	If a user name couldn't be found in the password file, then
 *	FALSE is returned.
 *
 *	Side Effects:
 *	If the first character of the string indicated by psource is a
 *	tilde ("~") then the subsequent user name is converted to a login
 *	directory name and stored in the string indicated by pdest.  Then
 *	remaining characters in the file name at psource are copied to
 *	pdest and both pointers are updated.  Upon return, psource points
 *	to the terminating character in the source file name and pdest
 *	points to the next character after the last character in the file
 *	name at that location.  If a tilde cannot be converted because the
 *	user name cannot be found, psource is still advanced past the current
 *	entry, but pdest is unaffected.  At most size characters will be
 *	stored at pdest, and the size is decremented by the number of
 *	characters we actually stored.
