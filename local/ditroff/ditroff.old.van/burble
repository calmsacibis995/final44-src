Typesetter-Independent TROFF
.SH
TROFF
.PP
The main component of the package is an updated version of
TROFF which is independent of any particular typesetter.
There are three major changes from the Version 7 package:
.IP (1)
TROFF reads a description of typesetter parameters
(sizes, resolution, fonts, character set)
for a particular typesetter.
It produces output in a device-independent ASCII format,
but parameterized for the specified typesetter.
A post-processor converts the device-independent format
into actual codes for a typesetter.
Prototype post-processors are provided for
Mergenthaler Linotron 202,
Autologic APS-5,
Wang CAT-4 and CAT-8,
Tektronix 4014, and
Imagen Canon laser printer.
New post-processors are straightforward to write.
.IP (2)
TROFF provides graphics primitives for
diagonal lines,
circles, ellipses, arcs, and splines.
These primitives are normally used by the PIC and IDEAL graphics languages
that are part of the package,
but can also be accessed directly.
.IP (3)
TROFF now permits up to 128 sizes and 256 fonts
and arbitrary character sets.
Other restrictions have been eliminated
(e.g., any number of fonts on a page);
new commands have been added.
.SH
Graphics Languages
.PP
PIC and IDEAL provide tools for including
diagrams in typeset documents;
both are TROFF pre-processors in the spirit
of EQN and TBL.
PIC is simpler and easier to learn;
IDEAL provides more powerful constructs like
shading and opaquing.
.SH
Updated Versions of EQN, TBL, REFER, Macro Packages
.PP
The package includes the current versions of
the EQN, TBL and REFER pre-processors,
and several macro packages.
.LP
.SH
Manuals
.PP
User manuals are included for all programs.
.SH
Caveats
.PP
This version of TROFF requires separate I and D spaces;
it is not likely to run on 11/40-style PDP-11's.
.PP
The post-processors are not necessarily production versions;
they will certainly need tinkering before
being placed into production use.
