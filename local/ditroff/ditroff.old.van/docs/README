This directory contains the various documents and man pages associated
with ditroff.  The following get distributed:

	deqn.1		ditroff.1	dtbl.t.1	dterm.1
	grn.1		ideal.1		pic.1		font.t.l
	trchange.l

and all get put in the local manual section.  The files with .t in
them are run through dtbl first, before being distributed.

Some of the manual pages and user documents have, as the first line,
the command sequence (or close to it) needed to produce them.  They
are, unfortunately, set up for distribution at Berkeley, so some
things may need to be changed for a particular installation.

gremlin documentation is in its own subdirectory.
