.TH CH2VFT 8 "February 1984"
.SH NAME
ch2vft, ch2rst \- convert ``.@'' font files to vfont (or RST) format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B ch2vft
[
.B \-i
.B \-s
]
fontfile
.sp 0.5v
.B ch2rst
[

.SH DESCRIPTION
Both of these programs read character format font files (the ``.@''
format \- see vft2ch(8) for a description of the format) and write
another format to standard output.
.I Ch2vft
writes vfont format for versatec printers, and
.I ch2rst
writes RST format for Imagen fonts.  If
.I fontfile
is missing, standard input is read.  Both programs expect a particular
resolution font and will produce a warning message if the resolution is
different.  The resolution for vfont files is 200 (in pixels per inch)
and for RST files is 240.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i
Causes the program to ignore all the glyph numbers (the number after
the colon that starts a glyph entry) in the file.  The glyphs are
instead numbered consecutively from zero in the order that they
exist in the file.
.TP
.B \-s
ch2vft normally trims down the field of bits to make the glyph only
as big as a bounding box.  The
.B \-s
option forces the whole field to be converted.  This is usefull for
making stipple patterns that need a specific size.
