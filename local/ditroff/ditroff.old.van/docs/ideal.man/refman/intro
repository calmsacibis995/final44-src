\*(id Reference Manual
.PP
\*(id programs are usually interpolated into \*(tf input files.
Each program must be preceded by a .IS line, and followed by
either a .IE line or a .IF line.
The .IE line directs that further text will
follow the picture, while the .IF line leaves the current
position as it was when the .IS line was encountered.

In this description, italicized names refer to nonterminal grammar symbols.
A parenthesized construct followed by a star means zero or
more repetitions of the construct within.
Comments may appear in \*(id programs between /* and */ brackets
(which nest), and between # and newline.
