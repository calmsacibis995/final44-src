\*(id usually prepares output for processing by \*(tf on the Mergenthaler Linotron 202:
the \-T202 flag is the default.
When invoked with the \-Taps option, it prepares output for the Autologic APS-5.
The \-p option directs that the output be generic $plot$ output.
The \-4 option causes the output to appear on the screen of a 4014.
Both options cause a screen erase at each .IS, but only the \-4
option causes a pause for input at each .IE.
The screen erase at .IS lines may be suppressed by including the line
.P1
\&...noerase
.P2
and may be restored by the line
.P1
\&...yeserase
.P2
Option \-n directs that the raw \*(id output remain uninterpreted,
so it can be run through  N\s-2ROFF\s0 without harm.
.NH 2
Quality Option
.IP
\-q
.PP
When \*(id is used to prepare figures for typeset text,
one has a choice of how to draw horizontal and vertical lines.
Without the \-q option, \*(id uses rule characters,
which draw the lines fast, but may not be accurate.
Giving the \-q option causes \*(id to draw all lines,
including horizontal and vertical lines, using dots;
this takes longer, but is more accurate.
.NH 2
Angle Processing
.IP
\-r
.PP
\*(id expects angles in degrees.
The \-r option causes \*(id to expect them in radians instead.
(See also the section on Angle Processing as a command to \*(id, below.)
.NH 2
Including Library Files
.IP
\-l$libfile$
.PP
This causes \*(id to read the named library file before it begins processing
the input files or the standard input.
(See also the section on Including Library Files as a command to \*(id, below.)
