.NH 1
Commands to the Postprocessor
.PP
Each of these commands must appear
with the .IS\(em.IE delimiters
on a separate line that begins with
three dots.
.NH 2
Defining the Bounding Box
.P1
\&...minx $number$
\&...miny $number$
\&...maxx $number$
\&...maxy $number$
.P2
.PP
The \*(id processor computes the minimum and maximum extent of the
picture in both $x$- and $y$-directions so that the bounding box
(hence, the picture) can be scaled to the desired width.
These commands allow you to override \*(id's computed bounding box.
They are useful when the computed bounding box is too large or too small.
The bounding box of an arc is the circle of which it is a part, which may
be too conservative.
\*(id cannot compute the bounding box of a string, so it doesn't try,
and this may be too liberal.
.PP
Normally these dimensions are computed anew for each picture produced
by \*(id.
Use the line
.P1
\&...obbox
.P2
between subsequent .IS\(em.IE[F] lines to keep the
bounding box of the previous picture.
.NH 2
Setting the Picture Width
.P1
\&...width $number$
.P2
.PP
This command causes the bounding box to be scaled to a width of $number$
inches.
(If not specified, the default is four inches.)
It persists across .IS\(em.IE boundaries.
.NH 2
Setting the Column Width
.P1
\&...colwid $number$
.P2
.PP
This command gives the width of the column in which the picture will appear
so that it can be centered in the column.
(If not specified, the default is six inches.)
It also persists across .IS\(em.IE boundaries.
.NH 2
Using Postprocessor Commands to Scale Pictures
.PP
The bounding box and width information can be adjusted
to scale the picture or move it on the page.
\*(id does not check that the entire picture is in fact
contained in the bounding box, and it cannot check
that the column width is correct:
it uses the bounding box information to scale the
picture to the width requested,
then uses the column width to center the bounding box.
.PP
For example, to produce figures at the right of the
page, \*(id was told that the column was nine inches wide.
Since the pictures are typically no more than two inches
wide, they lie within the actual six inch column.
.PP
Suppose one's \*(id figures are drawn in the unit square,
though some pieces lie a little outside,
and one wants one inch to correspond to one in \*(id's
coordinate system.
One could set the six parameters as follows:
.P1
\&...minx 0
\&...miny 0
\&...maxx 1
\&...maxy 1
\&...width 1
\&...colwid 6
.P2
.LP
This gives a way for \*(id users to get exact scale
representations of their pictures.
