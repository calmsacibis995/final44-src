Overview of \*(id
.PP
To take advantage of \*(id's capabilities,
you must believe that

.IT "complex numbers are good" .
.IP \(bu
Complex numbers have a natural correspondence
to points in the Cartesian ($x-y$) coordinate
system.
.IP \(bu
Using complex numbers obviates the need for
distinguishing between ``points'' and ``dimensions.''
.IP \(bu
Complex numbers capture readily such common
operations as translation, rotation, and
reflection in the plane.
.LP
\*(id programs define pictures by means of
a system of simultaneous equations in the
significant points of the picture and
a set of drawing instructions to be
carried out with respect to those points.
\*(id solves the system of equations,
then draws the picture using the points
so determined.
.PP
All variables in \*(id programs are complex
numbers, with the usual operations:
.IP \(bu
component-wise addition and subtraction:
$(a,b) ~ +- ~ (c,d) ~ = ~ (a +- c , b +- d)$
.IP \(bu
vector multiplication:
$(a,b)*(c,d) ~ = ~ (ac - bd , ad + bc)$
.IP \(bu
vector division:
$(a,b)/(c,d) ~ = ~ (ac + bd , -ad + bc)/( c sup 2 + d sup 2 )$
.IP \(bu
component manipulation:
$roman "re" ((a,b)) ~ = ~ a$,
$roman "im" ((a,b)) ~ = ~ b$,
and
$roman "conj" ((a,b)) ~ = ~ (a,-b)$
.IP \(bu
vector magnitude calculation:
$roman "abs" ((a,b)) ~ = ~ sqrt { { a sup 2 } + { b sup 2 } }$
.IP \(bu
unit vector function:
$roman "cis" ( theta ) ~ = ~ cos theta + i sin theta$
.LP
A non-standard notation that has proved useful is
$alpha [ x , y ]$, for complex $x$ and $y$,
defined by $x + alpha ( y - x )$, and
meaning ``$alpha$ of the way from $x$ to $y$.''
.PP
Scalars are treated as vectors with null imaginary component.
For example, ``1'' is treated as ``(1,0).''
.PP
The scale of the coordinate system in which
\*(id programs are written is entirely a matter
of convenience.
The \*(id processor proper
produces output in the same coordinate
system as the input.
Postprocessors (``filters'') scale this coordinate
system to make sense for the device on which the
picture is displayed.
.PP
Some of the pictures below include captions keyed
to the associated programs.
Some of the labels are not produced by the program:
I added them to help explain the picture.
Such labels are parenthesized.
For pictures and programs that have not been
labeled, you may find that labeling them yourself
helps you understand the program.
