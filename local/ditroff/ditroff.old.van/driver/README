This directory contains the sources for device filters (also known as
"drivers") for ditroff.  It also contains source for some utilities for
dealing with font files.

Drivers:
	graph.c		versatec/varian graphics routines
	draw.c		imagen graphics routines

	vsort.c		"preprocessor" for dver.c to sort and shuffle
			pages for the wide paper of the versatec.
	dver.c		versatec driver (along with vsort)
	dvar.c		varian driver
	dip.c		imagen driver
	dterm.c		dumb terminal driver

	ipr.sh		lpd filter shell for running the imagen printer

Utilities:
	ifontinfo.c	looks at imagen font on terminal
	vfontinfo.c	looks at varian/versatec (unrotated) font on terminal
	makevfont.c	converts va/vp fonts to ditroff width files.
	makeifont.c	converts imagen RST fonts to width files.
	rst2ch.c	convert imagen RST format font files to an
			editable (with vi) character format.
	vft2ch.c	convert vfont format font files to character format.
	qms2ch.c	convert QMS format font files to character format.
	x2ch.c		convert X (strike) font files to character format.
	ch2rst.c	convert character format to RST format font files.
	ch2vft.c	convert character format to vfont format font files.
	ch2qms.c	convert character format to QMS font file format.
	ch2x.c		convert character format to X (strike) format files.
	scalech.c	shrink character format files by a scaling factor
	rotate.c	read in (vertical) vfont files and convert to a
			"rotated" (90 degrees clockwise) font.

Other:
	ifont.desc\	The directories containing the device description and
	vfont.desc\	width table producers (mak.sh) for the imagen device,
	tfont.desc\	Versatec/Varian devices, and terminals.  The "devconfig"
			program should be run using "DESC" as it's argument
			to produce one "DESC.out" file that goes in the
			"dev---" directories (see the "dit.install" shell-
			script in the home directory)

Where things are:
/usr/local/lib/font - contains the "dev---" directories.  These directories
(one for each typesetter - currently va, vp, ip, ter) contain DESC.out
files for width tables and character position information.  The DESC.out
files come from devconfig (troff directory), which is run on DESC files
and (implicitly) width table files.

grn, pic, eqn - width tables in /usr/local/lib/font/dev---/DESC.out.
			--- is given by -P option.

ideal - library in /usr/lib/ideallib

troff - width tables in /usr/local/lib/font/dev---/DESC.out.  --- is given by
	the -P option.  Macro packages in /usr/lib/ditmac.

dip - width tables in /usr/local/lib/font/devip/DESC.out (FONTDIR/devip).
      Symbolic links to (rst) raster files in /usr/local/lib/ifontt (BITDIR).
   (  NOTE:  changing the name of the raster files to match troff's
	     expected one-or-two-character name would forego having
	     to use symbolic links.  If dip would search for various
	     point sizes, as do both dvar and dver, it would also be
	     unnecessary to include EVERY point size for each font   )

dver, dvar - width tables in /usr/local/lib/font/devv- (FONTDIR/devv-).
	     raster font files in /usr/lib/vfont (RASTDIR).
	     raster-file-name map in RASTDIR/fontmap.
