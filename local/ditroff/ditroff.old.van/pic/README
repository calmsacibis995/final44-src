To make a new pic,
	make

The output should be something like
	yacc -d picy.y
	
	conflicts: 32 shift/reduce
	cc  -c y.tab.c
	rm y.tab.c
	mv y.tab.o picy.o
	lex  picl.l
	1174/1300 nodes(%e), 3365/3500 positions(%p), 514/600 (%n), 26763 transitions
	, 44/100 packed char classes(%k), 1313/1400 packed transitions(%a), 1035/1200 output slots(%o)
	cc  -c lex.yy.c
	rm lex.yy.c
	mv lex.yy.o picl.o

You may have some trouble with Lex -- older versions of Lex have
default sizes of arrays set poorly, and the pic lexical phase
strains them.  If it complains about out of space in various ways,
such as "calloc returns 0" or more specific messages,
look at the output lines that say things like
"1174/1300 nodes(%e)" and decrease the corresponding %e line
at the top of picl.l to make the limit tighter.
I have done this fairly tightly already, but you might
squeeze a bit more if necessary.

If you are using the standard version of Troff (i.e., the one that
drives the Graphics Systems CAT), the following CAVEAT applies:


I have included with this version of PIC code that in principle
will drive the old (i.e., standard) version of Troff.  The way
it works is to draw slanted lines, circles, etc., with millions
of small periods, so as might be expected it is slow and produces
voluminous input to troff.

To set things up for your typesetter and troff, you may want
to diddle some defaults.

1.  The typesetter type has to be set in main.c; I have it set
up for the Linotron 202, which is almost certainly not what you want.
In main.c, set devtype to DEVCAT and res to 432.

2.  When you compile with Make, you must one way or another
define the constant OLDTROFF in pltroff.c, either by
	make CFLAGS=-DOLDTROFF
or by adding the line
	#define OLDTROFF
to pltroff.c.

There are no guarantees with the old-style stuff, since I can't
really give it an effective test.  I will be glad to take back
improvements for subsequent distribution, however.

Good luck.

End of CAVEAT.

The file UNDOC describes a couple of things that have been
added to PIC since TM-80-1272-2 (June 9, 1980).
