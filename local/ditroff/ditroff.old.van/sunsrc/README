This directory contains the sources for a ditroff previewer and the
gremlin graphics editor for SUN workstations.  All other program
sources in adjacent directories can be copied to a SUN and compiled
directly (i.e. eqn, tbl, troff...) except for dvar.c and dver.c,
which have some byte-swap dependencies.

The SUN vfont format and the regular vfont format are NOT compatible
since they have some c structures imbedded in the file, plus word- not
byte-alignment.  The programs that deal with vfont formats handle the
differences appropriately.
