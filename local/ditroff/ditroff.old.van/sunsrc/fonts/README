	This directory contains the font files for running "dsun" and
"gremlin" on the SUN workstations.  There are scripts called "xxx.maker"
that, when run, produce ".@" format versions of gremlin and dsun's fonts.
They must be converted to vfont files ON THE SUN MACHINES, using the sun
version of ch2vft.  The imagen and varian/versatec versions of the sun
format files are here in the dev* directories.  There are makefiles in
the "imagen" and "versatec" directories for updating those font files on
a SUN machine, if that is necessary.
