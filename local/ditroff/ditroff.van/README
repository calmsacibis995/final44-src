This directory contains the current version of ditroff.

It subdirectories contain all other necessary programs etc, to make
the system work.

Note that theses sources are the frozen one as around:
	 Wed Dec  5 23:23:11 MET 1984.
It is only the parts of the ditroff distribution tape that are actually used,
of course with a lot of improvements and added stuff.

The binaries are generated with `make install', everything will be done
automatically.
Note that and the macros files tbl will not be generated (yet)!!!

There is more work in progress to get a better system.
