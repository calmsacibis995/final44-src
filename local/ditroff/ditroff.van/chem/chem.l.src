.SH NAME
chem \- troff preprocessor for chemical structure diagrams
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B chem
files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I
Chem
is yet another preprocessor like eqn, pic, etc., 
this time for producing chemical structure diagrams.
Today's version is best suited for organic chemistry
(bonds, rings) and it's excruciatingly slow sometimes.
Who knows what the future may hold.
.PP
In a style reminiscent of
.I eqn
and
.I pic,
diagrams are
written in a special language and occur in a document
surrounded by lines beginning
.br
	.cstart
.br
and
.br
	.cend
.br
(in the first column, naturally).  Anything outside
these is copied through intact;  whatever is between
\&.cstart and .cend is converted into pic commands to
draw the diagram.
.PP
So as a bare minimum,
.nf
	.cstart
	CH3
	bond
	CH3
	.cend
.fi
prints two CH3 groups with a bond between them.
To actually print this, you must run chem, pic,
troff, and your output filter on whatever file
contains the input.
.SH FILES
.nf
chem.awk	awkscript for chem
chem.macros	pic(1) marcros
.fi

.SH BUGS
.I Chem
needs the current version of awk;
you will get some mysterious error messages from awk
if your version is too old.  You will also profit from
having sensible and consistent definitions for the PS
and PE macros
.SH WISH LIST
.br
It's too slow (but it's too early in the game to optimize).
.br
Error checking is minimal;  errors are usually detected
and reported in an oblique fashion by pic.
.br
There's no library or file inclusion mechanism, and there's
no shorthand for repetitive structures.
.br
The extension mechanism is to create pic macros, but these
are tricky to get right and don't have all the properties
of built-in objects.
.br
There's no in-line chemistry yet (e.g., analogous to
the $...$ construct of eqn).
.br
There is no way to control entry point for bonds on groups.
Normally a bond connects to the carbon atom if entering from
the top or bottom and otherwise to the nearest corner.
.br
Bonds from substituted atoms on heterocycles do not join
at the proper place without adding a bit of pic.
.br
There is no decent primitive for brackets.
.br
Text (quoted strings) doesn't work very well.
.br
A squiggle bond is needed.
