===========================================================================

What you need to use psfig:

	+ a ditroff (device-independent troff) that accepts the \X
		command for text pass-thru. ditroff from DWB 2.0 or 
		greater will do.

	+ source to psdit from the adobe transcript package

	+ (optionally) source for ditroff to make some minor fixes.

	+ of course, a postscript printer for the final result. Draft
		copies do not need a postscript device.

========================================================================
What to do:

1. Compile the preprocessor:
	cd src; make psfig
	cp psfig /usr/local (or /usr/bin, &c...)

2. Next, install the patches to psdit and psdit.pro.
** Read patches/README for instructions on the psdit.c and psdit.pro patches.

3. Copy lib/psfig.tmac to the troff macro directory (/usr/lib/tmac).

4. Finally, if you are up to it and have ditroff source, apply
	the ditroff patch. (less critical) If you don't make the
	patch, figures may not center properly and figures won't
	work inside eqn. The centering problem can be alleviated
	by using "-f" with psfig.

Give the test program a spin...

% cd tst
% make test.ps

make a copy of the manaul...

% cd doc 
% dopaper

Note that the slew of warnings from psfig about `psfig.ps.?' on the first pass
is no problem and should be ignored. (due to recursive figure processing...)
