     _P_s_f_i_g is a preprocessor for _d_i_t_r_o_f_f(1) that permits direct
     inclusion of PostScript figures and special effects into a
     document.	The input files are copied to the standard out-
     put, except for lines between .F+ and .F- commands, which
     are assumed to contain _p_s_f_i_g commands. If no input files are
     given, _p_s_f_i_g reads the standard input, so it may be used as
     part of a pipe to ditroff.  The -_D<_d_i_r> option specifies a
     directory in which to search for files. Any number of these
     may be specified, and they will be searched in turn. The
     current directory is always searched first.

     The -_m_p_s_f_i_g argument must be given to _d_i_t_r_o_f_f, whose output
     is passed to _p_s_d_i_t, the ditroff to postscript conversion
     program supplied with the Transcript package, which produces
     the final output.

     _P_s_f_i_g commands are enclosed between `.F+' and `.F-' macros
     in your document.	The simplest _p_s_f_i_g command is the word
     `figure', followed by the name of a PostScript file. For
     example,

	  .F+
	  figure image.ps
	  .F-

     would include the figure in `image.ps' into your document as
     a centered display.  _P_s_f_i_g uses bounding box information
     from the PostScript file to decide where the figure is nor-
     mally printed on the page, then performs the appropriate
     translation to move the figure to the current spot on the
     _d_i_t_r_o_f_f page.  The proper amount of space is reserved so
     that the figure doesn't conflict with anything else on the
     page. Adding an `L' argument to `.F+' would force the figure
     to be flush left.

     Several options may be specified on the `figure' command,
     including `height' or `width' followed by a troff value,
     which would shrink or enlarge the figure to the specified
     measurement. If either a height and a width is specified,
     but not both, then the figure is scaled equally so that the
     shape of the figure is maintained. For example

	  .F+
	  figure image.ps height 1i
	  .F-

     would include `image.ps' scaled so that it has a vertical
     edge of one inch.

     For _p_s_f_i_g to properly scale and move a figure, it must be
     able to tell what it's natural size and position on the page
     are. This is usually specified by the bounding box comment
     in the PostScript file. Unfortunately, some applications
     (including MacDraw) do not provide this information. In this
     case you can add the clause `bounds _l_l_x _l_l_y _u_r_x _u_r_y' to the
     figure command, manually specifying the bounding box of the
     figure.  The four coordinates are, respectively, the lower
     left _x coordinate, the lower left _y coordinate, the upper
     right _x coordinate, and the upper right _y coordinate of the
     figure's bounding box, all specified in points relative to
     an origin in the lower left corner of the page.

     If a figure is very expensive to print (say a 100K image) it
     can be set in draft mode, printing just an outline box and
     the name of the file, for all but the final version of the
     document. Each _p_s_f_i_g figure has a level associated with it;
     the default is 10, but this may be superseeded with a `level
     _n' clause on the figure command.  -_d<_l_e_v_e_l> flag specifies
     the draft level for _p_s_f_i_g to run at. If the level of a fig-
     ure exceeds the draft level, the figure is printed in draft
     mode (just an outline box.) The default draft level is 100,
     and the default level of a figure is 10.  If just a -_d is
     specified with no level, zero is assumed.	In full draft
     mode, _p_s_f_i_g is quite flexible. Plain-vanilla _t_r_o_f_f (or even
     _n_r_o_f_f) and any generic output device will suffice, so that
     you can write a paper on a non-PostScript system in draft
     mode, then print the final copy on a PostScript system.
