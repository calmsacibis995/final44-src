	Franz Lisp Distribution
	
  This note describes our distribution policy for Franz Lisp.

What is being distributed:
  We distribute only source code in order to keep the distribution
  small and relatively Unix independent.   Makefiles are provided to
  build the entire lisp system from source, even if you don't have
  a version of lisp running already.  This process takes about 3 cpu
  hours on a Vax 780.  [This version for the Vax and 68000.  If you
  are running a unisoft 68000 system, Contact ucbkim.layer@berkeley
  for more advice]

  The following source is provided:
    lisp interpreter, 
    compiler (liszt),
    cross reference program (lxref),
    lisp manual,
    and other utility programs:
       trace, step, debug, cmu library functions, (and other minor ones),
       and these packages from the MIT lisp library:
	    defstruct, loop. 
   	    [These programs are provided as a convenience to those who can't
	     access the arpanet and copy them.  There is no documentation for
	     them in the Franz Lisp manual.  The best source of documentation
	     is the Lisp Machine manual (available from MIT, Symbolics
	     or LMI)]

   Regarding Flavors:  there are two implementations of flavors for
	Franz Lisp, one from MIT (contact person Richard Zippel (rz@mit-mc))
	and one from the University of Maryland (contact person
	Liz Allen  (liz.umcp-cs@udel-relay)).  Neither implementation is
	exactly like flavors on the Lisp Machine (due to differences between
	Lisp Machine lisp and Franz Lisp), and the implementations differ
	from each other.    The MIT version cannot be distributed by 
	us (yet) due to licensing problems.   If you have a Lisp Machine
	Source license from Symbolics, you should be able to get a copy
	from MIT.
	For a Tech Report on Maryland flavors, write to Liz Allen.

What is the form of the distribution:
  The files are packaged in a giant (3.1Mbyte) shell script.  Running this
shell script through 'sh' will result in a directory tree.  A ReadMe file
in the current directory will contain instructions on building the lisp
system.  The shell script is broken into a number of smaller files.
The current distribution looks something like:

The '38.87' means Opus 38, minor version 87.  These numbers may be different
by the time you get your distribution.  The files opus38.79.* are the source
for franz itself, and suffice for vaxes and 68010's running Berkeley (paging)
unix.  The file lispas contains an assembler for 68000s that put out .o files
in the Berkeley long-names format, and is needed for systems such as unisoft
v7 whose own assembler uses a different format.  The files x68k.* are assembly
language equivalents of the basic franz system written in lisp.  They
are only needed for 68k system with insufficient memory to run the compiler
(600k < memory < 1.25 Meg).

files from this shell script, you need only type:

	cat * | sh


To get a copy of the distribution:
  The distribution may be obtained either using FTP from an arpanet site,
or on a magnetic tape through the U.S Mail.

 Arpanet:
   The files are stored on one or both of the arpanet hosts:
	'ucbkim'   'ucbvax'    (Check 'ucbkim' first)
   You can login as 'anonymous'.   Use your name as the password.
   The files are in the subdirectory pub/lisp.
   
   For those who have accounts on ucbvax or ucbkim, the full 
   path is ~ftp/pub/lisp.

 Mag Tape:
   In order to get a copy of the distribution mailed to you, send a check to
 cover our tape copying and mailing costs (fees are listed below).  We will
 purchase the mag tape and you are free to keep it.  Please do NOT
 send us a tape.

     Fees:
     		$50	- distribution tape mailed 3rd class
	    add $10	- a copy of the Lisp Manual (we will only
	       		  send one copy, you are free to photocopy it)
  	    add $7	- send tape via 1st class mail.

	     -or-
	     	$15	- for just a copy of the Lisp Manual

 The address to send checks to is 

	Kevin Layer
	EECS/Computer Science Division
	573 Evans Hall
	University of California
	Berkeley, CA  94720

 All checks should be made out to "Regents, University of California."
 We require pre-payment.  We will not invoice or process purchase orders.



Disclaimers:
    This distribution works on the latest versions of Unix running at
    Berkeley (4.2 BSD).  We can't guarantee that it will work on older
    versions (although, if you are running 4.1, it is almost certain
    that it will work, but we have not verified it).
    VMS users who are using a typical Unix compatibility package will 
    probably not be able to build a lisp from this distribution unless they
    know a great deal about VMS and their compatibility package.
    At least one package (Eunice) supports Franz at this time.
    
Redistribution:
    If you get a copy of the distribution, you are free to give it to
    other people.  We appreciate being informed of new sites so they
    can be put on a mailing list (electronic and conventional).  This
    list is used to announce new releases.  To be put on this list,
    send U.S. Mail to Kevin Layer (address above) or to 
    franz-friends-request@berkeley or ucbvax!franz-friends-request
