Table of contents for franz/liszt/bench
----
This directory contains benchmark programs to test the compiler.
The benchmark files whose names are preceeded by + are the files
which contain the official Franz Lisp version of the lisp timing project 
source or results of a benchmark.

tak.l -- submission from japan.  comments at the beginning of file give
	details.
+ takbench.l - tak using benchmac

Puzzle benchmark
  rz_puzzle.l -- program as provided by rz@mit-mc.  it uses unnamed arrays
	which are not too efficiently done in franz

  puzzle.l -- program modified to used named arrays.

  jpuzzle.l -- program modified to use vectors (really just big hunks)
   vector.l -- functions and macros to provide vector support required 
		for jpuzzle to compile.

   
acker.l  -- ackerman's function.

pairs.l -- an official benchmark from the lisp timings group.  It tests
	memory allocation and member.  It is run by saying (test).
  pairs.results -- the result of our running the pairs benchmark.


+ frpoly.l -- polynomial manipulation, submitted by fateman
	the function frp-bench runs through all benchmarks.

fib.l --- the fib function and lots of code around it to permit running
	of timings on it.
