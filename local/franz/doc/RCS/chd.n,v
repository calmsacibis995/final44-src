The VMS version of 
.Fr
uses these functions instead of \fIdumplisp\fP for saving and restoring
a lisp.
.Lf savelisp "'st_filename"
.Re
t
.Se
This saves the current lisp system on the file named st_filename.
.Lf restorelisp "'st_filename"
.Wh
st_filename is the name of a file created by \fIsavelisp\fP.
.Re
t
.Se
This restores the lisp to the state it was in when the corresponding
\fIsavelisp\fP was done.
Anything done in the current lisp will be lost.
