a lisp.

This saves the current lisp system on the file named st_filename.
.Lf restorelisp "'st_filename"

st_filename is the name of a file created by \fIsavelisp\fP.
.Re

.Se
This restores the lisp to the state it was in when the corresponding
\fIsavelisp\fP was done.
Anything done in the current lisp will be lost.
