  sdcsvax!davidson pointed out that the documentation for implode is incorrect.
This is what it should be:
----------
.Lf implode "'l_arg"
.Wh
l_arg is a list of symbols, strings and small fixnums.
.Re
The symbol whose print name is the result of concatenating the 
first characters of the print names of the symbols and strings
in the list.
Any fixnums are converted to the equivalent ascii character.
In order to concatenate entire strings or print names, use the
function
.i concat .
