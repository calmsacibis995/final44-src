Bug fix for Lisp V36
Fix #: l36.3
File affected: fex1.c

Symptom:
 If a go tag was undefined in the first prog found, lisp would loop.
For example, this would fail: (def foo (lambda nil (prog nil (go a))))

 *** in file fex1.c, function Nprog add the one line marked by a (+)

			/* label not found in this prog, must 
			 * go up to higher prog
			 */
(+)			errp = Popframe();	/* go to next frame */
			Inonlocalgo(C_GO,lispretval,nil);

			/* NOT REACHED */

	case C_INITIAL: break;
