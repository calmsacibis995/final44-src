Bug fix for Lisp Opus 38.01 (and earlier).
Fix #: l38.1
File affected: franz/qfuncl.c (franz/qfuncl.s in earlier versions of Lisp)
Author: rz@mit-mc

Symptom: A compiled call to 'typep' would return the incorrect value when
	passed a port.

Fix: change the one line as shown in this diff:

134c134
< 	.long	_lispsys+83*4	# port_name
---
> 	.long	_lispsys+103*4	# port_name
