Bug fix for Lisp Opus 38.24 (and older)
Fix #: l38.5
File affected: franz/io.c
Author: jkf@berkeley

Franz's reader read '+_' as if it were '+0_0' and thus returned 0.  
This is ok by itself, however the printer printed the symbol |+_| as +_ (i.e
without the required escapes).

In order to determine whether '+_' is legal or not we checked the MacLisp
reader.  It does the exact opposite: it considers +_ to be a symbol (not a
number) and it escapes it on output (which is not really necessary).

We decided that Franz should consider +_ to be a symbol on input and should
not escape it on output.  Here is how to fix the reader.
The file is io.c, the function getnum(), look for c=='_' and replace
the clause with:
	} else if(c=='_') {
		if(sawdigit)	/* _ must be preceeded by a digit */
		{
		    push();
		    return(dopow(name,2));
		}
		else goto backout;
	} else if(c=='e' || c=='E' || c=='d' ||c=='D') {
