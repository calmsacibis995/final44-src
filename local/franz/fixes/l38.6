Bug fix for Lisp Opus 38.25 (and older)
Fix #: l38.6
File affected: franz/io.c
Author: jkf@berkeley

Franz's reader read  4dxx and 4Dxx and 4Exx  as 4exx.
The problem was that it guessed too soon that it was going to read an number
in exponential notation.

The fix is in funtion getnum() and is given in 3 parts

part 1: add the declaration indicated
lispval
getnum(name)
register char *name;
{
	unsigned char c;
	register lispval result;
	register FILE *useport=rdrport;
	unsigned char  stats;
	int sawdigit = 0, saweof = 0,cc;
	char *exploc = (char *) 0;		<<<--- add this
	double realno;
	extern lispval finatom(), calcnum(), newdoub(), dopow();


part 2: change the code after 'expt:' to this
expt:
	exploc = name;  /* remember location of exponent character */
	push();

part 3: change the code  after 'verylast:' to:
verylast:
 	/* scanf requires that the exponent be 'e' */
	if(exploc != (char *) 0 ) *exploc = 'e';
	*name=0;
