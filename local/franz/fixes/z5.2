Bug fix for Liszt V5.0
Fix #: z5.2
File affected: liszt/car.l
Author: jkf@berkeley

  The manual says that (declare (specials t)) declares all variables special.
The function which handles that declaration is missing from liszt.
Please add it to car.l after the function `macros'.

(def specials
  (nlambda (args) (setq special (car args))))
