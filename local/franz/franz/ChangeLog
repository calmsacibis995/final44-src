	(now: version 38.86)
	
Mon Nov 21 14:25:37 1983 by jkf
	added check in error (common0.l) so that <UNBOUND> values are

	The new symbol functions newsym, etc are now exprs or lexprs
	instead of fexprs
	(now: version 38.78)
	
Thu Aug 18 10:09:15 1983 by jkf
	Now it is permitted to call funcallhook and evalhook without
	doing (*rset t) and  (sstatus evalhook t).  Of course, the hook
	functions will not fire, but it won't be an error either.
	(now: version 38.75)
	
Mon Aug 15 12:21:54 1983 by jkf
	a number of new functions used by the bair people were added.

Mon Aug  8 09:02:06 1983 by jkf
	fixed a mis-feature in defmacro in which if the &protect
	feature was used, it returned a literal list as the body
	of the macro.  If this body was displaced (such as when
	displace-macros was t), then this would clobber the literal
	body and cause further use of the macro to cause problems.
	The solution was to copy the literal body each time it is used.
	(now: version 38.72)
	
Mon Aug  8 08:46:42 1983 by jkf

	uctolc, conforming to what maclisp does.
	(now: version 38.68)

Thu Jun 30 17:09:40 1983 by sklower

	one of which might influence subtraction of
	a fixnum from a bignum, even on the vax.
	(now: version 38.66)

Sat Jun 25 13:30:07 1983 by jkf
	added fixnum expt function: ^
	(now: version 38.64)
	
	make print respect the uctolc flag, so symbol names will

	(now: version 38.65)
	
Sun Jun 19 15:44:34 1983 by jkf

	the type of an array.
	
Sat Jun  4 02:03:08 1983 by sklower
	fix long standing bug in the reader, which would not allow you
	to read bignums or very long atoms.
	Also, allow lisp-library-directory to affect the built-in
	primative version of (load ...), and where cfasl finds
	its private verison of the loader.

Tue Jan 25 20:26:18 1983 by jkf
	fixed a bug in vector allocation which might leave a zero
	vector at the end of a page, and thus its type might appear
	to be the same as the following page's type
	(now: version 38.50)
	
Sat Jan 22 17:02:45 1983 by jkf
	fixed bug in Talloc.c vector page counting.
	made sysat.c zero the dtpr_pages after allocating the namestack.

	(now: version 38.49)
	
Mon Jan 17 22:39:39 1983 by layer
	Changed printr (in io.c) to break if bad data is passed, and

	fixed bug in putprop, protecting the newly allocated dtprs.
	
Fri Dec 10 09:45:53 1982 by jkf
	modified Talloc.c to keep track of the number of items used during
	sweeping. Previously it just computed that number from the number
	that were free.  This was the wrong thing to do for vectors, which
	span pages.
	
Thu Dec  9 20:03:44 1982 by jkf
	uncovered a major bug in the vector sweeper (Talloc.c).
	(now: version 38.44)
	
Mon Dec  6 05:50:09 1982 by jkf
	the size field of a vector now stores the number of BYTES in
	the data segment.  Vectors are still allocated in longword
	chunks, so to determine the size of a vector, you have to round
	up to the next 4 bytes (use macro VecTotSize).  
	new functions: vsize vsize-word and vsize-byte. call int:vsize.
	changed new-vector-{byte,word,long} to new-vectori-{byte,word,long}
	(now: version 38.43)

Tue Nov 30 08:51:12 1982 by jkf
	switched order of args to vset, now it is (vset 'vect 'ind 'value)
	the same goes for the vseti functions.

	(now: version 38.41)
	
Wed Nov  3 15:17:26 1982 by jkf
	made putprop add new indicators to the front.
	(now: version 38.40)
	
Sun Oct 31 09:22:39 1982 by jkf
	If profiling was enabled (by -DPROF in qfuncl.c), then qoneplus
	and qoneminus would return incorrect results, the typical result
	being that the compiler would die generating large lists.
	It has been fixed.
	
Fri Oct 29 09:07:14 1982 by jkf
	filestat code moved to int:franz-call as fc_stat. Also changed
	to return a vector.  filestat (now in common2.l) tilde-expands.
	Fixed bug in vector allocation.  Also, made the vector allocator
	put nil in the property field.
	(now: version 38.39)
	
Thu Oct 28 14:11:46 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in macroexpand: it wasn't looking for autoload-macros.
	(now: version 38.38)
	
Wed Oct 27 19:33:05 1982 by jkf
	added sys:time and sys:chmod to common2.l and lam9.c
	also sys:getpid
	(now: version 38.37)
	
Tue Oct 26 14:00:04 1982 by jkf
	moved length from common1.l to common0.l so certain
	defmacros would work in macros.l
	
Mon Oct 25 22:51:58 1982 by jkf
	added 'if' (and If) macro to macros.l   They do both the
	keyword and non-keyword types of if.
	(now: version 38.36)
	
Mon Oct 25 10:33:08 1982 by jkf
	load will print out the last form read if an error occurs
	while reading.
	(now: version 38.35)
	
Mon Oct 25 10:04:54 1982 by jkf
	Summary of new functions and redefined old ones.
	These are in common2.l

	chdir			redef (C version should be removed)
	sys:unlink		new
	
Mon Oct 25 08:52:55 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in Lpatom, it didn't set the global prinlevel
	and prinlength variables: plevel and plength, before calling
	printr.   A better solution would be to put that checking
	in a new routine iprintr(), and have iprintr call printr (which
	recursively calls printr());
	
Sun Oct 24 22:37:25 1982 by jkf
	added tilde-expand function to do what the csh does with ~.
	If tilde-expansion is t, tilde expansion will be done on
	filenames by the standard functions (see above).
	added int:franz-call to lam9.c, leaving it open for expansion.
	Added new experimental top level (tpl.l) to /usr/lib/lisp.
	
Sun Oct 24 14:04:30 1982 by jkf
	fixed a bug in Ifuncal in which it poped the actual arguments
	off the stack even when a debugging frame was stacked, thus
	throwing away information which evalframe required.
	
Sat Oct 23 23:45:33 1982 by jkf
	fixed bugs in funcall and apply: they didn't protect interpreted
	function definitions which they were eval'ing the function.
	
Sat Oct 23 13:01:45 1982 by jkf
	Added lexpr-funcall to eval.c (cross between funcall and apply).
	
Fri Oct 22 12:29:31 1982 by jkf
	Our closures have a subset of the features traditional closures
	have.  Thus they have been renamed 'fclosures'.
	If environment sharing is to be done, it must be done explicitly
	using fclosure-list.
	(now: version 38.34)
	
Wed Oct 20 20:45:14 1982 by jkf
	Added closures (eval.c, io.c, lisp code in /usr/lib/lisp/vector.l)
	(now: version 38.33)
	
Tue Oct 19 19:44:58 1982 by jkf
	now the compiler can autoload macros, the toplevel.l has been
	modified so the undefined function handler looks for macro-autoload.
	Also, set up macro autoloads for loop and defstruct.
	Added definition of defcmacro to macros.l
	Added definition of nth in common2.l
	Added cmacros for nth and nthcdr in common2.l
	Added macros push and pop in common2.l:

		(pop stack)
		(pop stack tolocation)
	Add flavors to /usr/lib/lisp (files flavors.l, hash.l, vanilla.l)
	Add mit-vax's lmhacks to machacks.
	(now: version 38.32)
	
Tue Oct 12 21:51:21 1982 by jkf
	add time-string function
	(now: version 38.31)
	
Sat Oct  9 01:49:54 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in fasl (nfasl.c) in which a (fasl 'foo.o) would
	not print an error message if foo.o didn't exist.

	Added new functions *process, *process-send and *process-receive.
	The nlambda process is now written using *process
	(now: version 38.30)

	
Tue Oct  5 22:24:22 1982 by jkf
	added argument number checking in Liszt, so added the file
	/usr/lib/lisp/fcninfo.l to describe the C coded functions.
	(now: version 38.29)
	
Sun Oct  3 19:44:07 1982 by jkf
	added a special variable load-most-recent to common1.l affecting the
	load function.  If given a non nil value, then it will tell load to
	load or fasl the most recently modified of the .o and .l file.
	Load will only check modification times if it is given a filename
	without an extension, e.g. (load 'x).
	(now: version 38.28)
	
Sat Oct  2 14:59:26 1982 by jkf
	added a special variable top-level-print to toplevel.l.  If given
	a non nil value, its value will be funcall'ed to print out the
	value in the read-eval-print loop.
	(now: version 38.27)
	
Sat Sep 25 09:58:23 1982 by jkf
	increased the size of the profile buffer to 1Mbyte. (lamp.c)
	
Thu Sep 23 23:11:56 1982 by jkf
	added mon.c to the lisp source used when profiling.  mon.c
	contains the monitor() function which used to be in the C
	library (and should still be) but which was put in the C startup
	code in the current Unix distribution.  Once monitor is put back
	in the C library, we can get rid of the file mon.c
	
Tue Sep 14 08:48:02 1982 by jkf
	4dxx 4Dxx and 4Exx were read as 4exx.  This was fixed (fix l38.6).
	(now: version 38.26)
	
Mon Sep 13 15:26:57 1982 by jkf
	+_ is not read as a symbol instead of 0.  see fix l38.5
	(now: version 38.25)

	fixed makereadtable so that it will accept no arguments as
	advertised in the lisp manual.
	
	Numerous other changes were made during this period in order to
	make franz more portable.  (hopefully) none of them were visible to
	the user. 
	(now: version 38.24)
	
Tue Jul 20 12:03:26 1982 by jkf

	a 128 element hunk.
	
Sat Jul  3 19:49:59 1982 by jkf
	made some mods to array.l so that array access was faster.
	replaced arrayref by offset-cxr in cases where it was a value
	array that was being accessed.
	
Fri Jun 25 15:24:37 1982 by jkf
	fixed csegment so that it incremented the page count.  This required
	adding 'other' as a real type
	(now: version 38.23)
	
Tue Jun 22 08:39:01 1982 by jkf
	fixed ../Makefile so lisp can be installed in official distribution

Fri Jun 18 13:56:14 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in setq which occured when setq was given no arguments
	
Thu Jun 17 15:37:11 1982 by jkf

	(now: version 38.20)
	
Thu May 27 14:38:15 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in the code to reset the translinks after a load or
	fasl.
	file affected: common1.l
	(now: version 38.19)
	
Tue May 25 06:17:51 1982 by jkf

	(now: version: 38.18)
	
Wed May 12 13:36:20 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in fileopen (lam8.c) in which it failed to store
	the name of the file opened.   
	(now: version 38.17)

Wed May  5 20:37:39 1982 by jkf
	added function hunk-to-list which takes a hunk as an argument
	and returns a list.
	The error message which is printed when a too large print name
	is encountered was improved.
	(now: version 38.16)

Wed May  5 20:20:10 1982 by jkf
	sped up makhunk in common1.l.  Used =& instead of equal
	(now: version 38.15)

Wed Apr 28 09:37:45 1982 by jkf
	if $ldprint is non-nil, then load will print [load filename]
	before it does a load of a lisp source file.
	file affected: common1.l
	(now: version 38.14)

Mon Apr 26 21:29:35 1982 by jkf

	improved error message for fixnum interpreted functions.
	added fixnum functions 1+ and 1-
	files affected: lam4.c, sysat.c, h/lfuncs.h
	(now: version 38.13)

Sat Apr 24 08:39:01 1982 by jkf
	Changed 'function' so that it works exactly like 'quote' 
	(in the interpreter).  This was necessary to preserve equivalence
	with liszt which now always returns a symbol for 'function',
	not a binary object.   This also makes the handling of 'function'
	compatible with Maclisp type lisps.
	(now: version 38.12)

Fri Apr 23 14:03:13 1982 by sklower
	modified Ifcall to push a frame on the stack to indicate
	that lisp is calling fortran: F_TO_FORT. Another identifier,
	F_TO_LISP is pushed when coming from fortran to lisp.  The
	purpose of this is mainly to indicate when the current values
	of np and lbot should be used.
	files affected: inits.c, eval2.c and most likely others.

Fri Apr 23 12:34:39 1982 by jkf
	fixed 'signal' so that it tells the operating system to
	ignore ignored signals, rather than just putting a notation
	in the sigacts array.  This is important if you want
	waiting processes to ignore signals
	file affected: lam6.c

Wed Apr 21 23:59:41 1982 by jkf
	write function int:showstack which returns one showstack
	frame.  then wrote showstack and baktrace in lisp.
	files affected: lam3.c, sysat.c, lfuncs.h, common2.l
	(now: version 38.11)

Wed Apr 21 13:41:25 1982 by jkf
	the read-in-lisprc function will now act like the liszt. it
	will search first in . then in $HOME.  It will search
	first for .o then .l then "" (soon to be removed).
	the name it will look for are .lisprc and lisprc
	(now: version 38.10)

Sun Apr 18 12:51:06 1982 by jkf
	added functions to access parts of a filestat structure
	file affected: common2.l
	(now: version 38.09)

Sun Apr 18 12:46:22 1982 by jkf
	added the function (pp-form 'g_form ['p_port]) which
	should be used instead of $prpr.  $prpr will be removed
	but for now, it also exists
	file affected: pp.l

Sat Apr 17 14:03:30 1982 by jkf
	modified tyi in lam6.c so that it will take an optional second
	argument which is the value to return upon eof.
 	file affected: lam6.c

Sat Apr 17 12:53:18 1982 by jkf
	modified load in common1.l, so that if a fasl is done when the
	translinks are turned on, the new functions fasl'ed will be
	linked in.  Previously, you would have to explictly relink the
	tables after fasl'ing in or else the old functions would be
	used.  files affected: common1.l, toplevel.l (autoloading)

Tue Apr 13 14:32:11 1982 by jkf
	added vector and vectori data types.
	files affected:Talloc.c, lam8.c, io.c, sysat.c, lam1.c
	    data.c, Orderit.s,  h/global.h, h/lfuncs.h, h/sigtab.h
	will describe the new functions once they stabilize

Tue Apr 13 09:26:12 1982 by jkf
	short circuit recursive evaluation of arguments to lambdas if
	  the arguments are bound atoms or int's or strings.
	  file affected: eval.c
	(now: version 38.08)

Tue Apr 13 00:00:08 1982 by jkf
	if the lisp variable 'displace-macros' is non-nil, then when
	  a macro expansion is done, the resulting expansion replaces
	  the definition.  
	  files affected: eval.c, sysat.c, h/sigtab.h
	(now: version 38.07)

Mon Apr 12 10:32:21 1982 by jkf
	keith made changes to these files in response to kashtan's work
   	to get franz working under vms:
		<to be filled in>
	fixed filestat to produce ctime.  also modified filestat: fcns.
		files affected: lam8.c, common2.l
	(now: version 38.06)

Tue Apr  6 13:07:13 1982 by jkf
	vertical tab was listed as 9. in charmac, it should be 11.
	(now: version 38.05)

Sun Apr  4 12:13:40 1982 by jkf
	qfuncl.c: preserved r0 across call to Undeff. This caused a
	    obscure error after a call to an autoloaded function from
	    compiled code. (fix l38.3)
	eval.c: modified function Undeff to insure that it only returned
	    a symbol. Otherwise qlinker would do the wrong thing.
	    (fix l38.3)
	toplevel.l: made a better error message if autoloading  a file
	    didn't work correctly.  Not important enough to send out a
	    fix.
	(now version: 38.04)

Thu Apr  1 11:09:37 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in append2args (fix l38.2)
	added filestat:* functions to common2.l to access filestat
	  info.  They should probably be macros.
	modified C coded filestat to return all the stat information
	(now: version 38.03)

Wed Mar 31 08:13:45 1982 by jkf
	In order to keep track of which version has which fixes in it,
	I've added a file version.l to /usr/lib/lisp.  This sets two 
	variables:
   		franz-minor-version-number: reflects the particular edit
		this-lisp-version-built: ctime string set when lisp loaded
	(now: version 38.02)

Tue Mar 30 08:43:01 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in qfuncl.c (address of port_name).  Fixed distribution
	source.   (now: version 38.01)

Fri Mar 19 11:17:12 1982 by jkf
	make distribution. (now: version 38.00)

Fri Mar 19 11:16:33 1982 by jkf
	fix bug in makeenv. it wasn't protecting a dtpr from gc while
	building the environment.

Tue Mar 16 10:55:47 1982 by jkf
	backquote will now correctly handle `(a \, b) resulting in
	the list (a |,| b)

Mon Mar 15 21:40:23 1982 by jkf
	add Ibindvars and Iunbindvars to permit progv to be open compiled.
	Functions are in lam7.c, and nfasl.c is modified to put those 
	entry points in the symbol table.

Mon Mar 15 21:39:56 1982 by jkf
	Allow concat to generate full size strings

Sun Mar 14 15:58:50 1982 by jkf
	added setting of initial values for Standard-Input, Standard-Output
	and Standard-Error.  These symbols should be considered read-only by
	the user.  Originally they were set in the lisp code, but because
	the standard input was changed while the lisp code was fasled in,
	Standard-Input was never set correctly.

Tue Feb 23 10:26:56 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in allocator (next_one in Talloc.c).  If a symbol
	was allocated and there were non left, next_one incorrectly
	assumed that symbols were not gc'ed and thus failed to 
	trigger a gc.

Tue Feb 16 11:34:56 1982 by jkf
	In order to use the new reader, the setsyntax function was 
	written in lisp to use symbolic character types.  the 
	getsyntax function was also written in lisp and it uses
	the new int:getsyntax function written in C.

Tue Feb 16 11:32:34 1982 by sklower
	the reader was modified to look at the bits of the character code
	independently.  Infix splicing and non splicing macros were added.
	Other readtable functions were changed: explode, print.
	
	
Tue Feb 16 11:03:22 1982 by jkf
	changed to opus 38

Fri Feb 12 16:06:03 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in eval.  if a function was interpreted, its definition
	was not stacked, the code assuming that the function would
	not redefine itself.  this is a poor assumption, so the code was
	changed to stack the function definiton

Tue Feb  9 22:37:48 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in bignum division, routine calqhat (in assembler).
	Problem was an incorrect rendering of step D3 of knuths
	bignum division algorithm.  It would fail very rarely.

Sun Feb  7 13:16:26 1982 by jkf
	fixed bug in fasl (file nfasl.c), whereby if more than 500
	functions were defined, it would scribble in memory, usually
	causing a 'bad format for fasl file' error.  The limit is 
	now 2000 and if that is exceeded, an error message will be 
	produced.

Fri Dec 25 21:46:20 1981 by jkf
	fixed bug in macrox, whereby if a macro function did a read
	from another port, that port would be used when the macro 
	returned

Fri Dec 25 18:57:13 1981 by jkf
	fixed bug in readlist so that even if an error occurs during the
	readlist, the file descriptor will be de-allocated.
	Also fixed a bug which caused the mkstFI function fail to realize
	where were no more file descriptors left.
	file affected: lam6.c

Fri Dec 25 18:53:04 1981 by jkf
	modified the sharp sign macro in /usr/lib/lisp/backquote.l so that
	users can add there own handlers to the sharp sign macro.  There
	are many examples of the defsharp macro in backquote.l and
	documentation as well.

Fri Dec 25 18:49:58 1981 by jkf
	when allocating a large amount of space, now only MAXCLEAR is
	cleared at once with blzero.  This limit exists due to the
	limitations of the vax hardware (and the movc5 instruction)
	file affected: Talloc.c

Sun Dec 13 17:47:46 1981 by jkf
	converted qfuncl.s to be pre-processable by the C preprocessor.
	It is now named qfuncl.c and it has been re-entered into
	SCCS.  The old file: qfuncl.s is still sccs get'able.
	qfuncl.c, if compiled with -DPROF, will put in profiling code
	for the common functions.
	
Sun Dec  6 19:50:32 1981 by jkf
	made the error messages for reading a right paren or period
	be reasonable.
	
Sat Nov 21 00:30:10 1981 by jkf
	now load will not disable garbage collection during the loading
	process (it will not bind gcdisable to t).  This was done
	because it was causing problems: for example, if a dumplisp
	were done during a load, gcdisable would be 'permanently' set
	to t.
	
Thu Nov 19 20:33:34 1981 by jkf
	some people didn't like the fact that the compiler purcopies its
	literals.  Thus there is now a lisp symbol $purcopylits which
	when true tells fasl to purcopy the literals. It defaults to true.
	Files affected in the change: h/sigtab.h, sysat.c, nfasl.c,
	Talloc.c
	
Sat Nov  7 08:53:44 1981 by jkf
	more unwind-protect bugs:  if a non throw was intercepted by a 
	unwind-protect, it would be saved and restarted as if it were
	a throw.  This was fixed by having the value returned by a 
	*catch of ER%uwpt have its 'car' be the number of the class of non
	local goto which was caught by the unwind-protect.
	modified: frame.c and lam8.c
	
Tue Nov  3 09:49:42 1981 by jkf
	two bugs discoverd in franz's error handlers.
	Lerr: the call to errorh was done incorrectly (lam6.c)
	Lctcherr: handy was never given a value (lam8.c)
	both of these are being sent out as fix l36.?
	
Sat Oct 24 16:56:36 1981 by jkf
	in auxfns0.l:
	rewrote lambdacvt from scratch.  Now it will do things a bit
	more intelligently: making a lambda instead of a lexpr
	if only &aux variables are given.
	
Thu Oct 22 10:18:14 1981 by jkf
	added functions (actually equivalences) <&,=& and >& to be the
	fixnum only equivlants of lessp,equal and greaterp.
	file affected: auxfns0.l
	
Thu Oct 22 10:16:40 1981 by jkf
	fixed bug in Ndo (fex2.c) whereby whenever a go was caught
	inside a do, the end test was evaluated next.  This was
	saved as bug fix l36.4 since even though we are on Opus 37,
	this bug exists in 36 as well.
	
Wed Oct 14 10:46:08 1981 by jkf
	fixed Lsyscall so it would return an inewint instead of a newint,
	thus preventing small not eq fixnums from entering the environment.
	file: lam4.c
	
Sat Oct 10 13:53:43 1981 by jkf
	Fixed Ltyi to return numbers in range 0 to 255 or -1 for
	EOF.  The key is that getc returns in integer which is 
	either -1 (for eof) or a number between 0 and 255 (0 and 127
	if in cooked mode).
	[file: lam6.c]
