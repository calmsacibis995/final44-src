To create FRL:

0) For vms systems, replace Makefile with vms.make
	Note for vmssystems.: do make -n and see what commands take place to
	create frl.  Sometimes these commands do not get
	executed by the makefile (bug in eunice, and make),
	and you have to execute them by typing them in.
	(In our exprerience, only the last command with the file
	    piped into lisp did not execute from the make program).

1) Set the LISP and COMPLR variables in the makefile to be the system
	franz lisp and franz liszt programs.
	Normally this is set to lisp and liszt, respectively.
	(currently this might be set
	to mylisp and nliszt since that is what is used at lbl).

2) Remove the file frllib/ftop.o, and do "make frllib/ftop.o".
	This will tell the system where the source and object to
	frl is stored, which is needed for the autoloading of
	the talk files.  If you move the source you should recompile
	frllib/ftop.o, and then redo the "make" command.
	To compile all of frl, do "make".  This will create
	all the lisp objects and an executable object "FRL".
	("vmsfrl" on vms systems).
	Delete the file "FRL" if you wish to only load objects
	into lisp instead of using FRL as a system in itself.
	"FRL" is an executable lisp system with all frl commands
	in it.

3) to load frl into lisp (from any directory), do 1 and 2
	and then load the file
	frl-main-dir/init.l (this will set up the search path
	correctly to look for all the files in the frl-main-dir.)

4) To load in the talk files, do either (talk) or (talk-load) in FRL.
	You do not need to be in the main frl directory to do this.

5) See the file dhl//ReadMe if you wish information on how to use
	the rule interpretor.

6) There is a manual section which can be added to the lisp manual,
	files: manual/frl.n .

Running programs from vms:

On the lbl vms system (lblh), the binaries are in /uc/rosenberg/newfrl
from VMS you say,
From DCL:
$ lisp:==$drc3:[rosenberg.newfrl]lisp.exe lisp
$ franz:==lisp -r drc3:[rosenberg.newfrl]lisp.
$ liszt:==lisp -r drc3:[rosenberg.newfrl]liszt.
$ vmsfrl:==lisp -r drc3:[rosenberg.newfrl]vmsfrl.

From csh:
$ csh
% set m=/uc/rosenberg/newfrl
% alias lisp "$m/lisp -r $m/lisp"
% alias liszt "$m/lisp -r $m/liszt"
% alias frl "$m/lisp -r $m/vmsfrl"
