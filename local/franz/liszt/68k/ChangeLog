Sun Jan 16 09:57:51 1983 by layer
	bug inthe way recursive macro calls were handled in d-exp.
	file: expr.l
	
Sun Jan 16 09:54:23 1983 by layer
	condition codes not setup properly in d-supercxr.
	file: funa.l
	
Thu Dec  9 18:54:52 1982 by layer
	Fixed the autorun feature in the compiler (w/ sklower's help).
	file: io.l (added sccs file autorun.s)
	
Fri Dec  3 19:15:04 1982 by layer
	This is just pure garbage, and I'm ashamed to admit to this hackery,
	but 'twas me.  The problem was that to do a rplac[ad] one needs
	indirection, and the value in d0 also needs to be saved.  If g-loc
	were not set to 'reg, then a "movl a0,d0" would be generated.
	files: func.l
	
Fri Dec  3 19:09:22 1982 by layer
	Fixed up d-superrplacx.  As it turned out, I just returned it to the
	state it was in before I started hacking it.
	file: funa.l
	
Tue Nov 30 21:55:27 1982 by layer
	lisztinit now uses (command-line-args).
	file: tlev.l
	
Tue Nov 16 19:18:04 1982 by layer
	d-supercxr had many problems.  Calls to d-structgen had been removed
	sometime ago, and they shouldn't have been. d-structgen needed to be
	changed a little.  Think it's ok now.
	file: funa.l
	
Thu Nov 11 00:17:14 1982 by layer
	There was a reference to Fixzero (839.....) that was OFFSET
	dependent.  It was changed to be done off Nilatom.
	file: io.l
	
Sun Nov  7 14:09:10 1982 by layer
	fixed bugs in the way _qnewint, etc were called.
	files: fixnum.l fun[ab].l
	
Sat Nov  6 02:23:56 1982 by layer
	d-cmp bugs.
	files: funb.l, util.l
	
Fri Nov  5 23:57:08 1982 by layer
	Nilatom moved back to chead.l (initialization part), and corrected
	the fact that the offset is hex, not dec.
	files: chead.l, funa.l, tlev.l
	
Fri Nov  5 23:55:41 1982 by layer
	d-cmp was really screwed up...
	file: util.l
	
Thu Nov  4 18:25:38 1982 by layer
	temp file called /tmp/Dual$$.s, and .a68 -> .s
	
Thu Nov  4 16:56:32 1982 by layer
	Bug in popframe, adding offet to sp, instead on movl'ing it.
	file: funa.l
	
Thu Nov  4 16:56:01 1982 by layer
	Bug in e-shallowbind, lea -> movl.
	file: io.l
	
Tue Nov  2 00:06:02 1982 by layer
	changed refs to Nilatom to nil-reg.
	files: io.l, util.l
	
Mon Nov  1 22:16:55 1982 by layer
	changed the role of a0 and a1.  Before, both were used to calculate
	intermediate addresses, and generally they were scratch.  Now, a5 is
	used for intermediate address calulations, and a0 and a1 are more
	used for lispval arith.  They are, however, considered scratch by
	the C compiler, so there values are not good over function calls.
	The compiler constants scratch-{a,d} were tossed, since a5 now plays
	that role.  Bug also fixed in d-alloc-register.
	files: chead.l expr.l fixnum.l fun[abc].l io.l tlev.l util.l
	
Sun Oct 31 20:33:32 1982 by layer
	changed the register allocation routines and initial register save
	mask.  d-regused won't mark d0,d1,d2,a0,a1 for saving since they are
	scratch registers (as far as the C compiler is concerned) anyway.
	files: chead.l datab.l expr.l fun[abc].l io.l tlev.l util.l
	
Fri Oct 29 19:09:18 1982 by layer
	found another boole reference in decl.l
	
Fri Oct 29 15:33:57 1982 by layer
	long mul,div, and rem temporarily punted to lisp.
	files: decl.l, fixnum.l
	
Fri Oct 29 15:31:32 1982 by layer
	punted the boole stuff.
	files: decl.l, funa.l
	
Fri Oct 29 01:53:09 1982 by layer
	Fixed bug in e-write3.  No, I don't want to talk about it (meaning
	that it was a stupid one).
	file: io.l
	
Thu Oct 28 22:19:23 1982 by layer
	ER%tpl set to break-err-handler for safe measure.
	files: cmake.l, slowcmake.l
	
Wed Oct 27 23:16:37 1982 by layer
	effected jkf's changes from the VAX version. syscall.o no longer
	loaded in funb and tlev (new sys: functions take care of UNIX system
	calls.  declare stuff changed back to what it was in may-82.
	(now version 8.16)
	
Wed Oct 27 19:33:05 1982 by layer
	d-sub didn't check for dtpr'ness on src operand. Also,
	instructions of the form sub #0,... are explicitly checked
	for, so that zero isn't subtracted.
	file: util.l
	
Wed Oct 27 17:10:30 1982 by layer
	Fixed bug in e-write3 -- it barfed on atoms and symbols
	(tried to take car of them).
	file: io.l
	
Wed Oct 27 13:35:37 1982 by layer
	Fixed a bug in the was fixnum expressions were computed.
	fixnum-reg was used to do indirection off of, after calling
	d-fixnumexp.
	files: fixnum.l, funa.l
	
Wed Oct 27 12:23:43 1982 by layer
	g-regmaskvec vector was never clear for each function.
	a5 is no longer automatically saved on function entry.
	files: io.l, tlev.l
	
Wed Oct 27 10:44:47 1982 by layer
	Bug in dotailrecursion (movab -> lea)
	file: expr.l
	
Tue Oct 26 23:51:47 1982 by layer
	Removed VAX addressing modes *n(Rn) and *X(Rn)[Rm] from e-cvtas.
	file: io.l

	(started with version 8.15)
