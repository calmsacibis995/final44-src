<H1>The BGP Protocol</H1>

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an exterior routing protocol 
used for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems.
BGP is used for exchange of routing information between multiple 
transit autonomous systems as well as between transit and stub 
autonomous systems.  BGP is related to EGP but operates with more 
capability, greater flexibility, and less required bandwidth.  BGP 
uses <EM>path attributes</EM> to provide more information about each 
route, and in particular maintain an <EM>AS path</EM>, which includes
the AS number of each autonomous system the route has transited, providing
information sufficient to prevent routing loops in an arbitrary topology.
Path attributes may also be used to distinguish between groups of routes to
determine administrative preferences, allowing greater flexibility in 
determining route preference to achieve a variety of administrative ends.
<P>

BGP supports two basic types of sessions between neighbours, internal
(sometimes refered to as IBGP) and external.  Internal sessions are
run between routers in the same autonomous system, while external
sessions run between routers in different autonomous systems.  When
sending routes to an external peer the local AS number is prepended
to the AS path, hence routes received from an external peer are guaranteed
to have the AS number of that peer at the start of the path.  Routes
received from an internal neighbour will not in general have the local AS
number prepended to the AS path, and hence will in general have the
same AS path that the route had when the originating internal neighbour
received the route from an external peer.  Routes with no AS numbers
in the path may be legitimately received from internal neighbours; these
indicate that the received route should be considered internal to your
own AS.
<P>

The BGP implementation supports three versions of the BGP protocol,
versions 2, 3 and 4.  BGP versions 2 and 3 are quite similar in
capability and function.  They will only propagate classed network
routes, and the AS path is a simple array of AS numbers.  BGP 4 will
propagate fully general address-and-mask routes, and the AS path has
some structure to represent the results of aggregating dissimilar routes.
<P>

External BGP sessions may or may not include a single metric, which
BGP calls the <EM>Multi-Exit Discriminator</EM>, in the path attributes.
For BGP versions 2 and 3 this metric is a 16-bit unsigned integer, for
BGP version 4 it is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  In either case smaller
values of the metric are to be preferred.  Currently this metric is
only used to break ties between routes with equal preference
from the same neighbour AS.  Internal BGP sessions carry at least
one metric in the path attributes, which BGP calls the <EM>LocalPref</EM>.
The size of the metric is identical to the MED.  For BGP versions 2 and 3
this metric is considered better when its value is smaller, for version 4
it is better when it is larger.  BGP version 4 sessions may optionally carry
a second metric on internal sessions, this being an internal version
of the <EM>Multi-Exit Discriminator</EM>.  The use of these metrics is
dependent on the type of internal protocol processing which is specified.
<P>

BGP collapses routes with similar path attributes into a single
update for advertisement.  Routes that are received in a single update 
will be readvertised in a single update.  The churn caused by the loss 
of a neighbor will be minimized and the initial advertisement sent
during peer establishment will be maximally compressed.  BGP does not 
read information from the kernel message-by-message, but fills the 
input buffer.  It processes all complete messages in the buffer before 
reading again.  BGP also does multiple reads to clear all incoming 
data queued on the socket.  This feature may cause other protocols to 
be blocked for prolonged intervals by a busy peer connection.
<P>

All unreachable messages are collected into a single
message and sent prior to reachable routes during a flash update.  For 
these unreachable announcements, the next hop is set to the local 
address on the connection, no metric is sent and the path origin is 
set to incomplete.  On external connections the AS path in unreachable 
announcements is set to the local AS, on internal connections the AS
path is set to zero length.  
<P>

The BGP implementation expects external peers to be directly attached to
a shared subnet, and expects those peers to advertise next hops which
are host addresses on that subnet (though this constraint can be relaxed
by configuration for testing).  For groups of internal peers, however,
there are several alternatives which may be selected from by specifying
the group type.  Type <CODE>internal</CODE> groups expect all peers to
be directly attached to a shared subnet so that, like external peers,
the next hops received in BGP advertisements may be used directly for
forwarding.  Type <CODE>routing</CODE> groups instead will determine
the immediate next hops for routes by using the next hop received with
a route from a peer as a forwarding address, and using this to look up
an immediate next hop in an IGP's routes.  Such groups support distant
peers, but need to be informed of the IGP whose routes they are using
to determine immediate next hops.  Finally, type <CODE>igp</CODE> groups
expect routes from the group peers to not be used for forwarding at
all.  Instead they expect that copies of the BGP routes received will
also be received via an IGP, and that the BGP routes will only be used
to determine the path attributes associated with the IGP routes.  Such
groups also support distant peers, and also need to be informed of the
IGP they are running with.
<P>

For internal BGP group types (and for test groups), where possible a
single outgoing message is built for all group peers based on the common 
policy.  A copy of the message is sent to every peer in the group,
with possible adjustments to the next hop field as appropriate to each 
peer.  This minimizes the computational load of running large numbers 
of peers in these types of groups.  BGP allows unconfigured peers to 
connect if an appropriate group has been configured with an 
<CODE>allow</CODE> clause.

</PRE>
     
<P>The <CODE>bgp</CODE> statement enables or disables BGP.  By default 
BGP is disabled.  The default metric for announcing routes via BGP is 
not to send a metric. 

<dl>
<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Sets the preference for routes learned from RIP.  The default
     preference is 170.  This preference may be overridden by a
     preference specified on the <code>group</code> or
     <code>peer</code> statments or by import policy.

<dt> <strong>defaultmetric</strong> <var>metric</var>
<dd> Defines the metric used when advertising routes via BGP.  If not
     specified, no metric is propagated.  This metric may be
     overridden by a metric specified on the neighbor or group
     statements or in export policy.

<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for BGP.  By default these are
     inherited from the global trace options.  These values may be
     overridden on a group or neighbor basis. (See <A
     HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and the BGP specific
     tracing options below.)
</dl>

<h3>Groups</h3>
     
BGP peers are grouped by type and the autonomous system of the peers.
Any number of groups may be specified, but each must have a unique
combination of type and peer autonomous system.  There are four
possible group types:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>group</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>external</strong> <strong>peeras</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var> 
<dd> In the classic external BGP group, full policy checking is
     applied to all incoming and outgoing advertisements. The external
     neighbors must be directly reachable through one of the machine's
     local interfaces.  By default no metric is included in external
     advertisements, and the next hop is computed with respect to the
     shared interface.
     <p>
	
<dt> <strong>group</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>internal</strong> <strong>peeras</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var> 
<dd> An internal group operating where there is no IP-level IGP, for
     example an SMDS network or MILNET.  All neighbors in this group
     are required to be directly reachable via a single interface.
     All next hop information is computed with respect to this
     interface. Import and export policy may be applied to group
     advertisements.  Routes received from external BGP or EGP
     neighbors are by default readvertised with the received metric. 
     <p>
	
<dt> <strong>group</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>igp</strong> <strong>peeras</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var> <strong>proto</strong> <var>proto</var>
<dd> An internal group that runs in association with an interior
     protocol.  The IGP group examines routes which the IGP is
     exporting and sends an advertisement only if the path attributes
     could not be entirely represented in the IGP tag mechanism.  Only
     the AS path, path origin, and transitive optional attributes are
     sent with routes. No metric is sent, and the next hop is set to
     the local address used by the connection.  Received internal BGP
     routes are not used or readvertised.  Instead, the AS path
     information is attached to the corresponding IGP route and the
     latter is used for readvertisement. Since internal IGP peers are
     sent only a subset of the routes which the IGP is exporting, the
     export policy used is the IGP's.  There is no need to implement
     the "don't routes from peers in the same group" constraint since
     the advertised routes are routes that IGP already exports.
     <p>

<dt> <strong>group</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>routing</strong> <strong>peeras</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var> <strong>proto</strong> <var>proto</var> <strong>interface</strong> <var>interface_list</var>
<dd> An internal group which uses the routes of an interior protocol
     to resolve forwarding addresses.  A type routing group propagates
     external routes between routers which are not directly connected,
     and computes immediate next hops for these routes by using the
     BGP next hop which arrived with the route as a forwarding address
     to be resolved via an internal protocol's routing information.  In
     essence, internal BGP is used to carry AS external routes, while the
     IGP is expected to only carry AS internal routes, and the latter is
     used to find immediate next hops for the former.
     <p>

     The <var>proto</var> names the interior protocol to be used to resolve
     BGP route next hops, and may be the name of any IGP in the configuration.
     By default the next hop in BGP routes advertised to type routing peers
     will be set to the local address on the BGP connection to those peers,
     as it is assumed a route to this address will be propagated via the IGP.
     The <var>interface_list</var> can optionally provide a list interfaces
     whose routes are carried via the IGP for which third party next hops
     may be used instead.
     <p>

<dt> <strong>group</strong> <strong>type</strong> <strong>test</strong> <strong>peeras</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var> 
<dd> An extension to external BGP which implements a fixed policy
     using test peers.  Fixed policy and <em>special case</em> code
     make test peers relatively inexpensive to maintain. Test peers do
     not need to be on a directly attached network.  If GateD and the
     peer are on the same (directly attached) subnet, the advertised
     next hop is computed with respect to that network, otherwise the
     next hop is the local machine's current next hop.  All routing
     information advertised by and received from a test peer is
     discarded, and all BGP advertiseable routes are sent back to the
     test peer.  Metrics from EGP- and BGP-derived routes are
     forwarded in the advertisement, otherwise no metric is included. 
     <p>
</dl>

<h4>Group parameters</h4>

The BGP statement has <code>group</code> clauses and <code>peer</code>
subclauses.  Any number of peer subclauses may be specified within a
group.  A group clause usually defines default parameters for a group
of peers, these parameters apply to all subsidiary peer subclauses.
Any parameters from the peer subclause may be specified on the group
clause to provide defaults for the whole group (which may be
overridden for individual peers).

<h4>Specifying peers</h4>

Within a group, BGP peers may be configured in one of two ways.  They
may be explicitly configured with a <code>peer</code> statement, or
implicitly configured with the <code>allow</code> statement.  Both are
described here:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>allow</strong>
<dd> The allow clauses allows for <code>peer</code> connections from
     any addresses in the specified range of network and mask pairs.
     All parameters for these peers must be configured on the group
     clause.  The internal peer structures are created when an
     incomming open request is received and destroyed when the
     connection is broken.  For more detail on specifying the
     network/mask pairs, see the section on <a
     href="filter.html">Route Filtering</a>.

<dt> <strong>peer</strong> <var>host</var>
<dd> A <code>peer</code> clause configures an individual peer.  Each
     peer inherits all parameters specified on a group as defaults.
     Those default may be overridden by parameters explicitly
     specified on the peer subclaus.

</dl>
     
<P>Within each <CODE>group</CODE> clause, individual peers can be 
specified or a group of <EM>potential</EM> peers can be specified 
using <CODE>allow</CODE>.  <CODE>Allow</CODE> is used to specify a set of 
address masks.  If GateD receives a BGP connection request from any 
address in the set specified, it will accept it and set up a peer 
relationship.

<h4>Peer parameters</h4>

<P>The BGP <CODE>peer</CODE> subclause allows the following parameters, 
which can also be specified on the <CODE>group</CODE> clause.  All 
are optional.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>metricout</strong> <var>metric</var>
<dd> If specified, this metric is used as the primary metric on all
     routes sent to the specified peer(s).  This metric overrides the
     default metric, a metric specified on the group and any metric
     specified by export policy.
	
<dt> <strong>localas</strong> <var>autonomous_system</var>
<dd> Identifies the autonomous system which GateD is representing to
     this group of peers..  The default is that which has been set
     globally in the <A
     HREF="defines.html#asno"><CODE>autonomoussystem</CODE></A>
     statement. 
	
<dt> <strong>nogendefault</strong>
<dd> Prevents GateD from generating a default route when EGP receives
     a valid update from its neighbor.  The default route is only
     generated when the <a
     href="options.html#gendefault">gendefault</a> option is enabled. 
	
<dt> <strong>gateway</strong> <var>gateway</var>
<dd> If a network is not shared with a peer, <code>gateway</code>
     specifies a router on an attached network to be used as the next
     hop router for routes received from this neighbor.  This
     parameter is not needed in most cases. 

<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Specifies  the  preference  used  for  routes learned  from these
     peers.   This can differ from the default BGP preference set
     in the <code>bgp</code> statement, so that GateD can prefer
     routes from one peer, or group of peer, over othes. This
     preference may be explicitly overriden by import policy. 

<dt> <strong>preference2</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> In the case of a <code>preference</code> tie, the second
     preference, <code>preference2</code> may be used to break the
     tie.  The default value is 0.

<dt> <strong>lcladdr</strong> <var>local_address</var>
<dd> Specifies the address to be used on the local end of the TCP
     connection with the peer.  For <em>external</em> peers the local
     address must be on an interface which is shared with the peer or
     with the peer's <em>gateway</em> when the <CODE>gateway</CODE>
     parameter is used.  A session with an external peer will only be
     opened when an interface with the appropriate local address
     (through which the peer or gateway address is directly reachable)
     is operating.  For other types of peers, a peer session will be
     maintained when any interface with the specified local address is
     operating.  In either case incoming connections will only be
     recognized as matching a configured peer if they are addressed to
     the configured local address.
	
<dt> <strong>holdtime</strong> <var>time</var>
<dd> Specifies the BGP holdtime value to use when negotiating the
     connection with this peer, in seconds.  According to BGP, if
     GateD does not receive a keepalive, update, or notification
     message within the period specified in the Hold Time field of the
     BGP Open message, then the BGP connection will be closed.  The
     value must be either 0 (no keepalives will be sent) or at least
     3.

<dt> <strong>version</strong> <var>version</var>
<dd> Specifies the version of the BGP protocol to use with this peer.
     If not specified, the highest supported version is used first and
     version negotiation is attempted.  If it is specified, only the
     specified version will be offered during negotiation.  Currently
     supported version are 2, 3 and 4.
	
<dt> <STRONG>passive</STRONG>
<dd> Specifies that active OPENs to this peer should not be 
     attempted.  GateD should wait for the peer to issue an
     open.  By default all explicitly configured peers are active,
     they periodically send OPEN messages until the peer responds.
	
<dt> <strong>sendbuffer</strong> <var>buffer_size</var>
<dt> <strong>recvbuffer</strong> <var>buffer_size</var>
<dd> Control the amount of send and receive buffering asked of the
     kernel.  The maximum supported is 65535 bytes although many
     kernels have a lower limit.  By default, GateD configures the
     maximum supported.  These parameters are not needed on normally
     functioning systems.
	
<dt> <strong>indelay</strong> <var>time</var>
<dt> <strong>outdelay</strong> <var>time</var>
<dd> Used to dampen route fluctuations.  <CODE>Indelay</CODE> is the
     amount of time a route learned from a BGP peer must be stable
     before it is accepted into the gated routing database.
     <CODE>Outdelay</CODE> is the amount of time a route must be
     present in the gated routing database before it is exported to
     BGP.  The default value for each is 0, meaning that these
     features are disabled.

<dt> <strong>keep</strong> <strong>all</strong>
<dd> Used to retain routes learned from a peer even if the routes' AS 
     paths contain one of our exported AS numbers.

<dt> <strong>analretentive</strong>
<dd> Causes GateD to issue warning messages when receiving
     questionable BGP updates such as duplicate routes and/or
     deletions of non-existing routes.  Normally these events are
     silently ignored.

<dt> <strong>noauthcheck</strong>
<dd> Normally GateD verifies that incoming packets have an
     authentication field of all ones.  This option may be used to
     allow communication with an implementation that uses some other
     form of authentication.

<dt> <strong>noaggregatorid</strong>
<dd> Causes GateD to specify the routerid in the aggregator attribute
     as zero (instead of its routerid) in order to prevent different
     routers in an AS from creating aggregate routes with different AS
     paths.

<dt> <strong>keepalivesalways</strong>
<dd> Causes gated to always send keepalives, even when an update could
     have correctly substituted for one.  This allows interoperability
     with routers that do not completely obey the protocol
     specifications on this point.

<dt> <strong>v3asloopokay</strong>
<dd> By default gated will not advertise routes whose AS path is
     looped (i.e. with an AS appearing more than once in the path) to
     version 3 external peers.  Setting this flag removes this
     constraint.  Ignored when set on internal groups or peers.

<dt> <strong>nov4asloop</strong>
<dd> Prevents routes with looped AS paths from being advertised to
     version 4 external peers.  This can be useful to avoid
     advertising such routes to peer which would incorrectly forward
     the routes on to version 3 neighbours.

<dd> <strong>logupdown</strong>
<dd> Causes a message to be logged via the syslog mechanism whenever a
     BGP peer enters or leaves the <code>ESTABLISHED</code> state.

<dt> <strong>ttl</strong> <var>ttl</var>
<dd> By default, GateD sets the IP TTL for local peers to <em>one</em>
     and the TTL for non-local peers to 255.  This option mainly is
     provided when attempting to communicate with improperly
     functioning routers that ignore packets sent with a TTL of one.
     Not all kernels allow the TTL to be specified for TCP
     connections.

<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for this BGP neighbor.  By
     default these are inherited from group or BGP global trace
     options. (See <A HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and
     the BGP specific tracing options below.)
