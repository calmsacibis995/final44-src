<H1>Glossary of Terms</H1>

Terms  used in descriptions throughout this document are  defined
below:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>adjacency</strong>
<dd> A relationship formed  between selected neighboring  routers  for
     the   purpose   of exchanging  routing information.   Not  every
     pair of neighboring routers becomes adjacent. 
	
<dt> <strong><a name="autonomous_system">autonomous system</a></strong>
<dd> A set of routers under a single technical  administration, using
     an  interior gateway protocol and common metrics to  route
     packets  within the AS, and using an exterior gateway  protocol
     to route packets  to  other ASs.   Since  this  classic
     definition   was developed, it has become common for a  single AS
     to use several interior gateway protocols and  sometimes several
     sets of metrics within an AS.  The use of the term Autonomous
     System stresses  that  even when multiple  igps  and metrics are
     used, the administration of an AS appears  to  other  ASs  to
     have  a   single coherent interior routing plan and presents a
     consistent  picture  of  what  networks   are reachable  through
     it.  The AS is represented by  a number between 1 and 65534,
     assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. 
	
<dt> <strong>BGP</strong>
<dt> <strong>Border Gateway Protocol</strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#egp">exterior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#BGP">BGP</a> section of the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a>

<dt> <var><a name="cost">cost</a></var>
<dd> An OSPF metric.  See metric.  <!-- XXX - list valid values>

<dt> <var><a name="delay">delay</a></var>
<dd> A HELLO metric.  Valid values are from zero to 30000 inclusive.
     The value of 30000 is the maximum metric and means unreachable.
     See metric.

<dt> <strong>designated router</strong>
<dd> <code>OSPF:</code> Each multiaccess network that has at least two
     attached routers as a designated router.  The designated router
     generates a link state advertisement for the multiaccess network
     and assists in running the protocol. The designated router is
     elected by the HELLO protocol.
	
<dt> <strong>destination</strong>
<dd> Any network or any host.
	
<dt> <var><a name="distance">distance</a></var>
<dd> An EGP metric.  See metric.  Valid values are from zero to 255
     inclusive.

<dt> <strong>egp</strong>
<dt> <strong>exterior gateway protocol</strong>
<dt> <strong>exterior routing protocol</strong>
<dd> A class of routing protocols used to exhange routing information
     within an autonomous system.  A detailed explaination of <a
     href="proto_over.html#egp"><strong>exterior gateway
     protocols</strong></a> is available in the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a>

<dt> <strong>EGP</strong>
<dt> <strong>Exterior Gateway Protocol</strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#egp">exterior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#904">EGP</a> section of the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a> 

<dt> <var><a name="gateway">gateway</a></var>
<dd> An intermediate destination by which packets are delivered to
     their ultimate destination.  A <code>host</code> address of
     another router that is directly reachable via an attached
     network.  As with any host address it may be specified
     symbolically.

<dt> <var><a name="gateway_list">gateway_list</a></var>
<dd> A list of one or more <code>gateway</code>s seperated by white
     space.

<dt> <strong>HELLO</strong>
<dt> <strong></strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#HELLO">HELLO</a> section of the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a>

<dt> <var><a name="host">host</a></var>
<dd> The IP address of any host.  Usually specified as a dotted quad,
     four values in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive seperated by dots
     (<code>.</code>).  For example <samp>132.236.199.63</samp> or
     <samp>10.0.0.51</samp>.  It may also be specified as an eight
     digit hexidecimal string preceeded by <code>0x</code>.  For
     example <samp>0x????????</samp> or <samp>0x0a000043</samp>.
     Finally, if <code>options noresolv</code> is not specified, a
     symbolic hostname.  For example <samp>gated.cornell.edu</samp> or
     <samp>nic.ddn.mil</samp>.  The numeric forms are much prefered
     over the symbolic form.

<dt> <var><a name="interface">interface</a></var>
<dd> The <code>host</code> address of an attached interface.  This is
     the address of a <em>broadcast</em>, <em>nbma</em> or
     <em>loopback</em> interface and the remote address of a
     <em>point-to-point</em> interface.  As with any host address it
     may be specified symbolically.

<dt> <strong>interface</strong>
<dd> The  connection between a router and  one  of its  attached
     networks.  A physical interface may  be  specified  by a single
     IP  address, domain name, or interface name.  (Unless  the
     network   is   an  unnumbered  point-to-point network.)
     Multiple levels of  reference  in the      configration
     language      allow identification of interfaces using  wildcard,
     interface type name, or delete word  address. Be careful with the
     use of interface names as future Unix operating systems may allow
     more than   one  address  per  interface.  Dynamic interfaces
     can  be  added  or  deleted   and indicated as up or down as well
     as changes to address, netmask and metric parameters. 

<dt> <strong>igp</strong>
<dt> <strong>interior gateway protocol</strong>
<dt> <strong>interior routing protocol</strong>
<dd> One of a class of routing protocols used to exhange routing
     information within an autonomous system.  A detailed explaination
     of <a href="proto_over.html#igp"><strong>interior gateway
     protocols</strong></a> is available in the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a>
	
<dt> <strong>interface_list</strong>
<dd> A list of one or more interface names including wildcard names
     (names without a number) and names which may specify more than
     one interface or address, or the token "all" for all interfaces.
     See the section on <a href="intfcs.html#interface
     list">interface lists</a> for more information.
	
<dt> <strong>IS-IS</strong>
<dt> <strong></strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#IS-IS">IS-IS</a> section of the <a
     href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a> 

<dt> <var><a name="local_address">local_address</a></var>
<dd> The <code>host</code> address of an attached interface.  This is
     the address of a <em>broadcast</em>, <em>nbma</em> or
     <em>loopback</em> interface and the local address of a
     <em>point-to-point</em> interface.  As with any host address it
     may be specified symbolically.

<dt> <var><a name="mask">mask</a></var>
<dd> A means of subdividing networks using address modification.   A
     mask is a dotted quad specifying which bits of the destination
     are significant.  Except when used in a <a
     href="#route_filter">route filter</a>, GateD only supports
     contiguous masks.
	
<dt> <strong>mask length</strong>
<dd> The number of significant bits in the mask.
	
<dt> <strong>metric</strong>
<dd> One of the units used to help a system determine the best route.
     Metrics may be based on hop count, routing delay, or an arbitrary
     value set by the administrator depending on the type of routing
     protocol.  Routing metrics may influence the value of assigned
     internal preferences.  (See preference.) <p> 
                    
     This sample table shows the range of possible values  for each
     routing protocol metric  and the value used by each protocol (See
     Protocol Overview.) to reach a destination. <p>
                    
<pre>
        SAMPLE ROUTING PROTOCOL METRICS
        Protocol  Metric Represents     Range    Unreachable
        --------  -----------------     -----    -----------
        RIP       distance (hop-count)  0-15           16

<dt> <strong>multiaccess networks</strong>
<dd> Those physical networks that support the attachment of multiple
     (more than two) routers.  Each pair of routers on such a network
     is assumed to be able to communicate directly. 

<dt> <strong><a name="natural_mask">natural mask</a></strong>
<dd> XXX - define

<dt> <strong>neighbor</strong>
<dd> Another router which with implicit or explicit communication is
     established by a routing protocol.  Neighbors are usually on a
     shared network, but not always.  This term is mostly used in OSPF
     and EGP.  Usually synonymous with <em>peer</em>.
	
<dt> <strong>neighboring routers</strong>
<dd> Two routers that have interfaces to a common network.  On
     multiaccess networks, routers are dynamically discovered by
     OSPF's HELLO protocol. 
	
<dt> <strong>network</strong>
<dd> Any packet-switched network.  A network  may be  specified  by
     its IP address  or  network name.    The   host   bits   in   a
     network specification must be zero.  <em>Default</em> may be used
     to   specify   the   default   network (0.0.0.0). 
	
<dt> <var><a name="network">network</a></var>
<dd> The IP address of a network.  Usually specified as a dotted quad,
     one to four values in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive seperated
     by dots (<code>.</code>).  For example <samp>132.236.199</samp>,
     <samp>132.236</samp> or <samp>10</samp>.  It may also be
     specified as a hexidecimal string preceeded by <code>0x</code>
     with an even number of digits between two and eight.  For example
     <samp>0x??????</samp>, <samp>0x????</samp> or <samp>0x0a</samp>.
     Also allowed is the symbolic value <code>default</code> which has
     the distinquished value <samp>0.0.0.0</samp>, the default
     network.  If <code>options noresolv</code> is not specified a
     symbolic network name.  For example <samp>nr-tech-prod</samp>,
     <samp>cornellu-net</samp> and <samp>arpanet</samp>.  The numeric
     forms are much prefered over the symbolic form.

<dt> <var><a name="number">number</a></var>
<dd> A positive integer.

<dt> <strong>OSPF</strong>
<dt> <strong>Open Shortest Path First</strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#OSPF">OSPF</a> section of the
     <a href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a> 

<dt> <var><a name="ospf_area">ospf_area</a></var>
<dd>

<dt> <strong>peer</strong>
<dd> Another router which with implicit or explicit communication is
     established by a routing protocol.  Peers are usually on a
     shared network, but not always.  This term is mostly used by BGP.
     Usually synonymous with <em>neighbor</em>. 

<dt> <var><a name="port">port</a></var>
<dd> A UDP or TCP port number.  Valid values are from 1 through 65535
     inclusive.

<dt> <var><a name="preference">preference</a></var> 
<dd> A <code>preference</code> is a value between 0 (zero) and 255
     used to select between many routes to the same destination.  The
     route with the best (numerically lowest) preference is as the
     <em>active</em> route.  The active route is the one installed in
     the kernel forwarding table and <em>exported</em> to other
     protocols.  Preference zero is usually reserved for routes to
     directly attached interfaces.  A default preference is assigned
     to each source from which GateD receives routes. (See <A
     HREF="pref.html">Preference</A>.)

<dt> <strong>prefix</strong>
<dd> A contiguous mask covering the most significant bits of an
     address.  The prefix length specifies how many bits are covered. 
	
<dt> <strong>QoS</strong>
<dt> <strong>quality of service</strong>
<dd> The OSI equivalent of <a href="#TOS">TOS</a>.
	
<dt> <strong>RIP</strong>
<dt> <strong>Routing Information Protocol</strong>
<dd> One of a class of <a href="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway
     protocols</a>, described in more detail in the <a
     href="proto_over.html#RIP">RIP</a> section of the
     <a href="proto_over.html">Protocol Overview.</a> 

<dt> <strong><a name="reject_route">reject route</a></strong>
<dd> XXX - define.

<dt> <strong><a name="route_filter">route filter</a></strong>
<dd> XXX - define.

<dt> <strong>router id</STRONG>
<dd> A 32-bit number assigned to each router running the OSPF
     protocol.  This number uniquely identifies the router within the
     autonomous system. 
	
<dt> <var><a name="router_id">router_id</a></var>
<dd> An IP address used as unique identifier assigned to represent a
     specific router.  This is usually the address of an attached
     interface.

<dt> <strong>RIB</strong>
<dt> <strong>routing information base</strong>
<dt> <strong>routing database</strong>
<dt> <strong>routing table</strong>
<dd> The repository of all of GateD's retained routing 
     information , used to make decisions and as a source for 
     routing information which is propagated.

<dt> <strong><a name="simplex">simplex</a></strong>
<dd> An interface may be marked as simplex either by the kernel, or by
     interface configuration.  A simplex interface is an interface on
     a broadcast media that is not capable of receiving packets it
     broadcasts.  <p>

     GateD takes advantage of interfaces that are capable of receiving
     their own broadcast packets to monitor whether an interface
     appears to be functioning properly.

<dt> <var><a name="time">time</a></var>
<dd> A time value, usually a time interval.  It may be specified in
     any one of the following forms:

     <dl>
     <dt> <var>number</var>
     <dd> A non-negative decimal number of seconds.  For example,
          <samp>27</samp>, <samp>60</samp> or <samp>3600</samp>.

     <dt> <var>number</var><strong>:</strong><var>number</var>
     <dd> A non-negative decimal number of minutes followed by a
          seconds value in the range of zero to 59 inclusive.  For
          example, <samp>0:27</samp>, <samp>1:00</samp> or
          <samp>60:00</samp>.

     <dt> <var>number</var><strong>:</strong><var>number</var><strong>:</strong><var>number</var>
     <dd> A non-negative decimal number of hours followed by a minutes
          value in the range of zero to 59 inclusive followed by a
          seconds value in the range of zero to 59 inclusive.  For
          example, <samp>0:00:27</samp>, <samp>0:01:00</samp> or
          <samp>1:00:00</samp>. 
     </dl>

<dt> <var>time to live</var>
<dt> <var><a name="ttl">ttl</a></var>
<dd> The <em>Time To Live (TTL)</em> of an IP packet.  Valid values
     are from one (1) through 255 inclusive.

<dt> <strong><a name="TOS">TOS</a></STRONG>
<dt> <strong>type of service</STRONG>
<dd> The <em>type of service</em> is for internet service quality
     selection.  The type of service is specified along the abstract
     parameters precedence, delay, throughput, reliability, and cost.
     These abstract parameters are to be mapped into the actual
     service parameters of the particular networks the datagram
     traverses.  The vast majority of IP traffic today uses the
     default type of service.
