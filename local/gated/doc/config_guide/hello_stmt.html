<H1>The Hello Protocol</H1>

It's really better not to use HELLO unless you have a specific need
for it.  We plan to drop it some time around GateD 4.0.
<P>

The HELLO protocol is an interior protocol that uses a routing metric
based on the length of time it takes a packet to make the trip between
the source and the destination.  HELLO packets carry timestamp
information which allows receivers to compute the shortest delay paths
to destinations.  The "best" route is the route with the shortest time
delay.  The unit of time used in HELLO is milliseconds.  If a HELLO
update packet takes less than 100 milliseconds to travel between two
routers, a minimum value of 100 is used for that hop.  Thus on
networks built of high-speed interfaces HELLO essentially defaults to
using hop counts.  As in any routing algorithm, HELLO cannot change
routes too rapidly or it would be unstable.  To avoid instabilities,
implementations of HELLO build in hysteresis and "hesitate" to change
routes until they have confidence that the change will be lasting.
<P>

By default HELLO, like RIP, uses the kernel interface metric set by the
<code>ifconfig</code> command to influence metric added to routes as
they are installed in the routing table (<code>metricin</code>).
Since the kernel interface metric is in hops, it must be translated
into HELLOs millisecond metric.  In order to do that, the following
table is used:

<pre>
	Hops	HELLO metric
	   0		   0
	   1		 100
	   2		 148
	   3		 219
	   4		 325
	   5		 481
	   6		 713
	   7		1057
	   8	        1567
	   9	        2322
	  10	        3440
	  11	        5097
	  12	        7552
	  13	       11190
	  14	       16579
	  15	       24564
	  16	       30000
</pre>

<p>
<h3> HELLO and network masks

HELLO derrives the network mask of received networks and hosts from
the network mask of the interface the packet via which the packet was
received.  If a received network or host is on the same natural
network as the interface over which it was received and that network
is subnetted (the specified mask is more specific than the
<em>natural</em> netmask), the subnet mask is applied to the
destination.  If bits outside the mask are set it is assumed to be a
host, otherwise it is assumed to be a subnet.  

<p>
On point-to-point interfaces, the netmask is applied to the remote
address.  The netmask on these interfaces is ignored if it matches the
natural network of the remote address or is all ones.

<p>
Unlike in previous releases, the zero subnet mask (a network that
matches the natural network of the interface, but has a more specific,
or longer, network mask) is ignored.  If this is not desirable, a <a
href="#route filter">route filter</a> may be used to reject it.

<H2>The Hello Statement</H2>

<pre>
<strong>hello</strong> <strong>yes</strong> | <strong>no</strong> | <strong>on</strong> | <strong>off</strong> [ <strong>{</strong>
    <strong>broadcast</strong> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>nobroadcast</strong> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>defaultmetric</strong> <var>metric</var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var> 
            [<strong>nohelloin</strong>] | [<strong>helloin</strong>]
            [<strong>nohelloout</strong>] | [<strong>helloout</strong>]
            [<strong>metricin</strong> <var>metric</var>]
            [<strong>metricout</strong> <var>metric</var>] <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>trustedgateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>sourcegateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var> <strong>;</strong>
<strong>}</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
</pre>
<p>
  
the <code>hello</code> statement enables or disables HELLO.  If the 
<code>hello</code> statement is not specified the default is 
<code>hello off</code>.  If enabled, HELLO will assume 
<code>nobroadcast</code> when there is only one interface and 
<code>broadcast</code> when there is more than one interface.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>broadcast</strong>
<dd> Specifies that HELLO packets will be broadcast regardless of the
number of interfaces present.  This is useful when propagating static
routes or routes learned from anther protocol into HELLO.  In some
cases, the use of <code>broadcast</code> when only one network
interface is present can cause data packets to traverse a single
network twice.

<dt> <strong>nobroadcast</strong>
<dd> Specifies that HELLO packets will not be broadcast on attached
interfaces, even if there are more than one.
If a <CODE>sourcegateways</CODE> clause is present, routes will still
be unicast directly to that gateway.

<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Sets the preference for routes learned from HELLO.  The default
preference is op.  This preference may be overridden by a preference
specified in import policy.
<dt> <strong>defaultmetric</strong> <var>metric</var> 
<dd> Defines the metric used when advertising routes via HELLO that were
learned from other protocols.  If not specified, the default value is
30000 (unreachable).  This choice of values requires you to explicitly
specify a metric in order to export routes from other protocols into
HELLO.  This metric may be overridden by a metric specified in export
policy.
	
<dt> <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var>
<dd> Controls various attributes of sending HELLO on specific
     interfaces.  See the section on <a href="intfcs.html#interface
     list">inteface list</a> specification for the description of the
     <var>interface_list</var>.
     <p>

     Note that if there are multiple interfaces configured on the same
     subnet, HELLO updates will only be sent from first one one which
     HELLO output is configured.  This limitation is required because of
     the way the Unix kernel operates.  It will hopefully be removed
     in a future release. 
     <p>

                    
	<dl>
	<dt> <STRONG>nohelloin</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that HELLO packets received via  the specified
	     interface will be ignored.  The default is to listen to
	     HELLO on all interfaces.
	<dt> <STRONG>helloin</strong>
	<dd> This is the default.  This argument may be necessary
	     when <code>nohelloin</code> is used on a wildcard interface
	     descriptor.
	<dt> <strong>nohelloout</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that no HELLO packets will be sent on the
	     specified interfaces.  The default is to send HELLO on all
	     interfaces when in <code>broadcast</code> mode.
	<dt> <STRONG>helloout</strong>
	<dd> This is the default.  This argument may be necessary
	     when <code>nohelloin</code> is used on a wildcard interface
	     descriptor.

	<dt> <strong>metricin</strong> <var>metric</var>
	<dd> Specifies the HELLO metric to add to incoming routes before
	     they are installed in the routing table.  The default is
	     the kernel interface metric plus 1 (which is the default
	     HELLO hop count).  If this value is specified it will be
	     used as the absolute value, the kernel metric will not be
	     added.  This option is used to make this router prefer
	     HELLO routes learned via the specified interface(s) less
	     than HELLO routes from other interfaces. 

	<dt> <strong>metricout</strong> <var>metric</var>
	<dd> Specifies the HELLO metric to be added to routes that are
	     send via the specified interface(s).  The default is
	     zero.  This option is used to make other routers prefer
	     other sources of HELLO routes over this router.

	</dl>

<dt> <strong>trustedgateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var>
<dd> Defines the list of gateways from which HELLO will accept
     updates.  The <var>gateway_list</var> is simply a list of host
     names or IP addresses.  By default, all routers on the shared
     network are trusted to supply routing information.  But if the
     <CODE>trustedgateways</CODE> clause is specified only updates
     from the gateways in the list are accepted.
	
<dt> <strong>sourcegateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var>
<dd> Defines a list of routers to which HELLO sends packets directly,
     not through multicast or broadcast.  Normally HELLO packets are
     broadcast to all systems on a shared network.  When
     <code>sourcegateways</code> is specified, HELLO packets are
     addressed directly to the specified gateways, even if
     <code>nobroadcast</code> is specified.
	
<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for HELLO.
(See <A HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and the HELLO specific
tracing options below.)

</dl>
<P>

The default preference is 90.  The default metric is 30000.

<h2>Tracing options</h2>
Packet tracing options (which may be modified with 
<code>detail</code>, <code>send</code> and/or <code>recv</code>):
