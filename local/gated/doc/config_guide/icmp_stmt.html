<H1>The ICMP Statement</H1>

On systems without the BSD routing socket, gated listens to ICMP
messages received by the system.  Currently gated only does processing
on ICMP redirect packets, but more functionality may be added in the
future, such as support for the router discovery messages.  Processing
of ICMP redirect messages is handled by the <a
href="redirect_stmt.html"><code>redirect</code> statement.</a>
<p>

Currently the only reason to specify the <code>icmp</code> statement
is to be able to trace the ICMP messages that gated receives.
