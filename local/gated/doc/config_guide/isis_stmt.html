<H1>The IS-IS Intra-Domain Protocol</H1>

<P>Further details of IS-IS configuration are currently described in 
a companion document (ISIS-config.ps) included in the gated 
distribution.  A typical configuration may specify mode (dual, iso), 
system level, traceoptions, and circuits and their metrics.

<P>IS-IS is a link state interior gateway protocol (IGP) originally 
developed for routing ISO/CLNP (International Organization for 
Standardization/Connectionless Network Protocol) packets.  The version 
distributed with GateD can route IP packets as well.  In ISO 
terminology a router is referred to as an "intermediate system" (IS).  
IS-IS intra-domain routing is organized hierarchically so that a large 
domain may be administratively divided into smaller areas using level 
1 ISs within areas and level 2 ISs between areas.  Routing between 
administrative domains is handled by Border Intermediate Systems 
(BISs) using IDRP, the inter-domain routing protocol.  Level 1 systems 
route directly to systems within their own area and route toward a 
Level 2 Intermediate System when the destination system is in a 
different area.  Level 2 Intermediate Systems route between areas and 
keep track of the paths to destination areas.  Systems in the Level 2 
subdomain route towards a destination area, or another routing domain.  
As with any internet routing protocol, IS-IS support for large routing 
domains may also include many types of individual subnetworks.  These 
subnetworks may include point-to-point links, multipoint links, 
dynalically established data links as in X.25 subnetworks and 
broadcast subnetworks like ISO 8802 LANs.
  
<P>In IS-IS all subnetwork types are treated by the subnetwork 
independent functions as though they were connectionless subnetworks 
using subnetwork convergence functions where necessary.  Like OSPF, 
IS-IS uses a "shortest-path first" algorithm to determine routes.  A 
congestion control component monitors and prevents buffer deadlock at 
each intermediate system.  GateD configuration syntax allows as much 
autoconfiguration as possible reducing the probability of error.  This 
integration also allows the ability to specify policy for exchanging 
routing information with other protocols running in GateD, such as 
BGP, EGP, RIP and IDRP.  The new IS-IS protocol supports multipath 
(load-split) forwarding and full injection of exterior network 
prefixes and attribute information with the goal of eliminating the 
need for any internal BGP or similar protocols.  IS-IS supports static 
routing domain information at level 2 ISs.  

<P>The reachable address 
prefix indicates that any Network Service Access Points (NSAPs) 
which match the prefix may be reachable via the Subnet Point 
of Attachment (SNPA) with which the prefix is associated.  Where the 
subnetwork to which this SNPA is connected is a general topology 
subnetwork supporting dynamically established data links, the prefix 
also has associated with it the required subnetwork addressing 
information, or an indication that it may be derived from the 
destination NSAP address.  The address prefixes are handled by the 
Level 2 routing algorithm in the same way information about Level 1 is 
handled within the domain.
  
<H2>The IS-IS Statement</H2>

    isis no | dual | ip | iso {

</PRE>
                 
<P>This statement enables the IS-IS protocol in GateD.  By default 
IS-IS is disabled.  The <CODE>dual</CODE> option specifies that the 
IS-IS protocol is enabled for both ISO and IP addressing.  The 
<CODE>isis</CODE> statement consists of an initial description of 
the IS and a list of statements that determine the 
configuration of the specific circuits and networks to be managed.  
Statements may appear in any order and include:

<P><DL>
<DT> <STRONG>level</STRONG>
	<DD> Indicates  whether  gated is running on a
                    Level  1 (intra-area) or Level 2 (inter-area) IS.
                    The default is Level  1.
	
<DT> <STRONG>traceoptions</STRONG>
<DD> are covered in the <A HREF="#trace_options">Trace Options</A>
     section below.

<DT> <STRONG>systemid</STRONG>
	<DD> Overrides   the  autoconfigured   system   ID
                    (determined  from  interface  addresses   and
                    corresponding   netmasks.)   If   no   system
                    identifier  is  specified,  the   system   ID
                    portion  of the first real circuit's NSAP  is
                    used.  Once a system ID is set, it cannot  be
                    changed without disabling and reenabling  all
                    of IS-IS.
	
<DT> <STRONG>area</STRONG>
	<DD> IS-IS   area   addresses  are   automatically
                    configured  based on the real  circuits  over
                    which  IS-IS  runs.  Addresses  specified  in
                    this statement are maintained in addition  to
                    those   configured  automatically  from   the
                    circuits.  This command is used primarily for
                    simulation.

<DT> <STRONG>circuit</STRONG>
	<DD> Each <CODE>circuit</CODE> statement specifies one of the 
	circuits the system will manage.  Circuits  normally
                    correspond  to UNIX interfaces, with 
                    <CODE>string</CODE> being the interface name, 
                    but simulated
                    device  names  may  also be  specified. 
                    If  the string is in the  form  of
                    "simN", where N is an integer, the circuit is
                    assumed to be a simulated circuit managed  by
                    the  network simulator troll.  The
                    circuit attributes are a list of options that
                    may  appear in any order in the circuit
                    statement.   

<DT> <STRONG>metric</STRONG>
	<DD> Allows  specifications  of  Level  1  and Level  2
                    metrics  for  each circuit. Only the  default
                    metric type is supported.  IS-IS metrics must
                    be in the range 1 to 63.  If no metric is set
                    for the circuit, the default value is 63.
	
<DT> <STRONG>priority</STRONG>
	<DD> Determines    designated   router    election
                    results;  higher  values give a higher 
                    likelihood of becoming the designated router.   
                    The level defaults  to
                    Level 1.  If  no   priority   is
                    specified, priority is set to a random  value
                    between 0 and 127.
                                        
                    <P>On a level 2 IS, to  configure a circuit with a Level 1 metric
                    of  10  and a Level 2 metric of 20,  add  two
                    metric options to the circuit statement.
	
</DL>
             
<P>The default Level is 1 : the default metric is 63.  
The default preference for IS-IS Level 1 is 15 for IS-IS Level 2 is 18.
