<H1>The OSPF Protocol</H1>

Open Shortest Path Routing (OSPF) is a <em>shortest path first</em>
(SPF) or <em>link-state</em> protocol.  OSPF is an interior gateway
protocol that distributes routing information between routers in a
single autonomous system.  OSPF chooses the least cost path as the
best path.  Suitable for complex networks with a large number of
routers, OSPF provides equal cost multipath routing where packets to a
single destination can be sent via more than one interface
simultaneously.  In a link-state protocol, each router maintains a
database describing the entire AS topology, which it builds out of the
collected link state advertisements of all routers.  Each
participating router distributes its local state (i.e., the router's
useable interfaces and reachable neighbors) throughout the AS by
flooding.  Each multiaccess network that has at least two attached
routers has a <em>designated router</em> and a <em>backup designated
router</em>.  The designated router floods a link state advertisement
for the multiaccess network and has other special responsibilities.
The designated router concept reduces the number of adjacencies
required on a multiaccess network.
<P>

OSPF allows networks to be grouped into areas.  Routing information
passed between areas is abstracted, potentially allowing a significant
reduction in routing traffic.  OSPF uses four different types of
routes, listed in order of preference: intra-area, inter-area, type 1
external and type 2 external.  Intra-area paths have destinations
within the same area, inter-area paths have destinations in other OSPF
areas and Autonomous System External (ASE) routes are routes to
destinations external to the AS.  Routes imported into OSPF as type 1
routes are supposed to be from igps whose external metrics are directly
comparible to OSPF metrics.  When a routing decision is being made,
OSPF will add the internal cost to the AS Border router to the
external metric.  Type 2 ASEs are used for egps whose metrics are not
comparable to OSPF metrics.  In this case, only the internal OSPF cost
to the AS Border router is used in the routing decision.
<P>

From the topology database, each router constructs a tree of the
shortest paths with itself as the root.  This shortest-path tree gives
the route to each destination in the AS.  Externally derived routing
information appears on the tree as leaves.  The link-state
advertisement format distinguishes between information acquired from
external sources and information acquired from internal routers, so
there is no ambiguity about the source or reliability of routes.
Externally derived routing information (for example, routes learned
from EGP or BGP) is passed transparently through the autonomous system
and is kept separate from OSPF's internally derived data.  Each
external route can also be tagged by the advertising router, enabling
a passing of additional information between routers on the borders of
the autonomous system.
<P>

OSPF optionally includes <em>type of service</em> (TOS) routing and
allows administrators to install multiple routes to a given
destination for each type of service (e.g. low delay or high
throughput.) A router running OSPF uses the destination address and
the type of service to choose the best route to the destination.
<P>

OSPF intra- and inter-area routes are always imported into the GateD
routing database with a preference of 10.  It would be a violation of
the protocol if an OSPF router did not participate fully in the area's
OSPF, so it is not possible to override this.  Although it is possible
to give other routes lower preference values explicitly, it is
ill-advised to do so.
<P>

Hardware multicast capabilities are also used where possible to
deliver link-status messages.  

OSPF areas are connected by the <em>backbone</em> area, the area with
identifier 0.0.0.0.  All areas must be logically contiguous and the
backbone is no exception.  To permit maximum flexibility, OSPF
allows the configuration of "virtual" links enable the backbone area
to appear contiguous despite the physical reality.
<P>

All OSPF protocol exchanges are authenticated.  Authentication
guarantees that routing information is only imported from trusted
routers, to protect the Internet and its users.  A variety of
authentication schemes can be used but a single scheme must be
configured for each area.  This enables some areas to use much
stricter authentication than others.
<P>

All routers in an area must agree on that area's parameters.  A
separate copy of the link-state algorithm is run for each area.
Because of this, most configuration parameters are defined on a per
area basis.  All routers belonging to an area must agree on that
area's configuration.  Misconfiguration will lead to adjacencies not
forming between neighbors, and routing information might not flow, or
even loop.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>defaults</strong>
<dd> These parameters specify the defaults used when importing OSPF
ASE routes into the gated routing table and exporting routes from the
gated routing table into OSPF ASEs.

	<dl>
	<dd> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
	<dt> The preference is used to determine how OSPF routes compete with
	     routes from other protocols in the gated routing table.
	     The default value is 150.

	<dd> <strong>cost</strong> <var>cost</var>
	<dt> The cost is used when exporting a non-OSPF route from the
	     GateD routing table into OSPF as an ASE.  The default
	     value is 1.  This may be explicitly overridden in export
	     policy.

	<dd> <strong>tag</strong> [ <strong>as</strong> ] <var>tag</var>
	<dt> OSPF ASE routes have a 32 bit tag field that is not used
	     by the OSPF protocol, but may be used by export policy to
	     filter routes.  When OSPF is interacting with an egp, the
	     tag field may be used to propagate AS path information,
	     in which case the <code>as</code> keyword is specified
	     aht the tag is limited to 12 bits of information.  If not
	     specified, the tag is set to zero.

	<dd> <strong>type</strong> <var>1</var> | <var>2</var>
	<dt> Routes exported from the GateD routing table into OSPF
	     default to becoming type 1 ASEs.  This default may be
	     explicitly changed here and overridden in export policy.
	</dl>

<dt> ASE export rate
<dd> Because of the nature of OSPF, the rate at which ASEs are
flooded must be limited.  These two parameters can be used to adjust
those rate limits.

	<dl>

	<dt> <strong>exportinterval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> This specifies how often a batch of ASE link state
	     advertisements will be generated and flooded into OSPF.
             The default is once per second.
	<dt> <strong>exportlimit</strong> <var>routes</var>
	<dd> This parameter specifies how many ASEs will be generated
	     and flooded in each batch.  The default is 100.
	</dl>

<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for RIP.
(See <A HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and the OSPF specific
tracing options below.)

<dt> <strong>monitorauthkey</strong> <var>authkey</var>
<dd> OSPF state may be queried using the <code>ospf_monitor</code>
(This should be a hyperlink) utility.  This utility sends non-standard
OSPF packets which generate a text response from OSPF.  By default
these requests are not authenticated, if an authentication key is
configured, the incoming requests must match the specified
authentication key.  No OSPF state may be changed by these packets,
but the act of quering OSPF can utilize system resouces.

<dt> <strong>backbone</strong>
<dt> <strong>area</strong> <var>area</var>
<dd> Each OSPF router must be configured into at least one OSPF area.
If more than one area is configured, at least one must the be
<code>backbone</code>.  The backbone may only be configured using the
<strong>backbone</strong> keyword, it may not be specified as
<code>area 0</code>.  The backbone interface may be a
<code>virtuallink</code>.

	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>authtype</strong> <var>0</var> | <var>1</var> | <var>none</var> | <var>simple</var>
	<dd> OSPF specifies an authentication scheme per area.  Each
	     interface in the area must use this same authentication
	     scheme although it may use a different
	     <code>authenticationkey</code>.  The currently valid
	     values are <code>none</code> (<code>0</code>) for no
	     authentication, or <code>simple</code> (<code>1</code>)
	     for simple password authentication.

	<dt> <strong>stub</strong> [ <strong>cost</strong> <var>cost</var>]
	<dd> A <code>stub</code> area is one in which there are no ASE
	     routes.  If a <code>cost</code> is specified, this is
	     used to inject a default route into the area with the
	     specified cost.

	<dt> <strong>networks</strong>
	<dd> The <code>networks</code> list describes the scope of an
	     area.  Intra-area LSAs that fall within the specified
	     ranges are not advertised into other areas as inter-area
	     routes.  Instead, the specified ranges are advertised
	     as <em>summary network</em> LSAs.  Intra-area LSAs that
	     do not fall into any range are also advertised as summary
	     network LSAs.  This option is very useful on well
	     designed networks in reducing the amount of routing
	     information propagated between areas.  The entries in
	     this list are either networks, or a subnetwork/mask pair.
	     See the section on <a href="filter.html">Route
	     Filtering</a> for more detail about specifying ranges.

        <dt> <strong>stubhosts</strong>
	<dd> This lists specifies directly attached hosts that should
	     be advertised as reachable from this router and the 
	     costs they should be advertised with.  Point-to-point
	     interfaces on which it is not desirable to run OSPF
	     should be specified here.
	     <p>
	     It is also useful to assign a additional address to the
	     loopback interface (one not on the 127 network) and
	     advertise it as a stub hosts.  If this address is the
	     same one used as the router-id it enables routing to OSPF
	     routers by router-id, instead of by interface address.
	     This is more reliable than routing to one of the routers
	     interface addresses which may not always be reachable.

	</dl>

<dt> <a name="interface"><strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var> [<strong>cost</strong> <var>cost</var> ]</a>
<dd> This form of the interface clause is used to configure a
     <code>broadcast</code> (which requires IP multicast support) or a
     <code>point-to-point</code> interface.  See the section on <a
     href="intfcs.html#interface list">inteface list</a>
     specification for the description of the
     <var>interface_list</var>. <p>

     Each interface has a <code>cost</code>.  The costs of all
     interfaces a packet must cross to reach a destination are summed
     to get the cost to that destination.  The default cost is one,
     but another non-zero value may be specified.
     <p>
     Interface parameters common to all types of interfaces are:

	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>retransmitinterval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> The number of seconds between link state
	     advertisement retransmissions for adjacencies
 	     belonging to this interface.

    	<dt> <strong>transitdelay</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> The  estimated number of seconds required  to
             transmit  a  link  state  update  over   this
             interface.  Transitdelay takes into  acccount
             transmission and propagation delays and  must
             be greater than 0.

	<dt> <strong>priority</strong> <var>priority</var>
	<dd> A  number  between 0 and 255  specifying  the
             priority for becoming the designated router on
             this interface.  When two routers attached to
             a  network  both attempt to become designated
             router,  the  one  with the highest  priority
             wins.  A router whose router priority is  set
             to  0  is  ineligible  to  become  designated
             router.
	     
    	<dt> <strong>hellointerval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> The length of time, in seconds, between Hello
             packets   that  the  router  sends   on   the
             interface.  

	<dt> <strong>routerdeadinterval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> The  number of seconds  not  hearing  a
             router's  Hello packets before  the  router's
             neighbors will declare it dovn.

	<dt> <strong>authkey</strong> <var>auth_key</var>
	<dd> Used by  OSPF authentication
             to  generate  and  verify the  authentication
             field in the OSPF header.  The authentication
             key  can  be  configured on a  per  interface
             basis.  It  is  specified by one  to  eight
             decimal digits separated by periods, a one to
             eight  byte  hexadecimal string  preceded  by
             <CODE>0x</CODE>,  or a one to eight character string in
             double quotes.
	</dl>

<dt> <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var> <strong>nonbroadcast</strong> [<strong>cost</strong> <var>cost</var> ]
<dd> This form of the interface clause is used to specify a
     <code>nonbroadcast</code> interface on a <code>non-broadcast
     multi-access</code> (NBMA) media.  Since an OSPF
     <code>broadcast</code> media must support IP multicasting, a
     broadcast capable media, such as Ethernet, that does not support
     IP multicasting must be configured as a non-broadcast interface.
     <p>
     A non-broadcast interface supports any of the standard <a
     href="#interface"><code>interface</code></a> clauses listed
     above, plus the following two that are specific to non-broadcast
     interfaces:

	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>pollinterval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> Before adjacency is established with a neighbor, OSPF
             packets are sent periodically at the specified
             <code>pollinterval</code>.

	<dt> <strong>routers</strong>
	<dd> By definition it is not possible to send broadcast
             packets to discover OSPF neighbors on a non-broadcast, so
             all neighbors must be configured.  The list includes one
     	     or more neighbors and an indication of their elligibility
             to become a designated router.
        </dl>

<dt> <strong>virtuallink</strong> <strong>neighborid</strong> <var>router_id</var> <strong>transitarea</strong> <var>area</var>
<dd> Virtual links are used to establish or increase connectivity of
     the backbone area.  The <code>neighborid</code> is the
     <em>router_id</em> of the other end of the virtual link.  The
     transit <code>area</code> specified must also configured on this
     system.  All standard interface parameters defined by the <a
     href="#interface"><code>interface</code></a> clause above may be
     specified on a virtual link.
</DL>
        
<hr>
<h2>Tracing options</h2>

In addition to the following OSPF specific trace flags, OSPF supports
the <code>state</code> which traces interface and neighbor state
machine transitions.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>lsabuild</strong>
<dd> Link State Advertisement creation
	
<dt> <strong>spf</strong>
<dd> Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations
	
<dt> <strong>lsatransmit</strong>
<dd> Link State Advertisement (LSA) transmission
	
<dt> <strong>lsareceive</strong>
<dd> LSA reception
	
<dt> <strong>state</strong>
<dd> State transitions
</dl>
                    
Packet tracing options (which may be modified with
<code>detail</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>recv</code>):

<dl>
<dt> <strong>hello</strong>
<dd> OSPF <CODE>HELLO</CODE> packets which are used to
     determine neighbor reachability.
	
<dt> <strong>dd</strong>
<dd> OSPF Database Description packets which are
     used in synchronizing OSPF databases.
	
<dt> <strong>request</strong>
<dd> OSPF Link State Request packets which are
     used in synchronizing OSPF databases.
	
<dt> <strong>lsu</strong>
<dd> OSPF Link State Update packets which are used
     in synchronizing OSPF databases.
	
<dt> <strong>ack</strong>
<dd> OSPF Link State Ack packets which are used in
     synchronizing OSPF databases.
</dl>
