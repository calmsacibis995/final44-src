<TITLE>GateD Configuration Guide - Preference</TITLE>
</head>
<body>

<H1>Preference</H1>

<P>Preference is the value GateD uses to order preference of routes from one 
protocol or peer over another.  Preference can be set in the GateD 
configuration files in several different configuration statements.  

Preference can be set based on network interface over another, from
one protocol over another, or from one remote gateway over another.

Preference may not be used to control the selection of routes within
an <STRONG>igp</STRONG>, this is accomplished automatically by the
protocol based on metric.  Preference may be used to select routes
from the same <STRONG>egp</STRONG> learned from different peers or
autonomous systems.

Each route has only one preference value associated with it, even 
though preference can be set at many places in the configuration file.  
Simply, the last or most specific preference value set for a route is the 
value used.  (See <A HREF="glossary.html#preference">Glossary: 
Preference</A>.) The preference value is an arbitrarily assigned value used 
to determine the order of routes to the same destination in a single 
routing database.  The active route is chosen by the lowest preference 
value.  

Some protocols implement a second preference (preference2), sometimes
refered to as a tie-breaker.  

<H3>Selecting a route</H3>

<P><UL>
<LI> The route with the best (numerically smallest) preference is prefered.
<LI> If the two routes have the same preference, the route with the
best (numerically smallest) preference2 (also known as a tie-breaker)
is prefered.
<LI> A route learned from a <STRONG>igp</STRONG> is prefered to a
route learned from an <STRONG>egp</STRONG>.  Least prefered is a route
learned indirectly by an <strong>igp</strong> from an
<strong>egp</strong>.
<LI> If AS path information is available it is used to help determine
the most prefered route.
<UL>
	<LI> A route with an AS path is prefered over one without and AS path
	<LI> If the AS paths and origins are identical, the route with
	     the lower metric is prefered.
	<LI> A route with an AS path origin of <STRONG>igp</STRONG> is
	     prefered over a route with an AS path origin of
	     <STRONG>egp</STRONG>.  Least prefered is an AS path with
	     an <STRONG>unknown</STRONG> origin.
	<LI> A route with a shorter AS path is prefered.
</UL>
<LI> If both routes are from the same protocol and AS, the one with
the lowest metric is prefered.
<LI> The route with the lowest numeric next-hop address is used.
</UL>

<H3>Assigning preferences</H3>

<P> A default preference is assigned to each source from which GateD
receives routes.  Preference values range from 0 to 255 with the
lowest number indicating the most preferred route.
     
<P> The following table summarizes the default preference values for routes 
learned in various ways.  The table lists the statements (some of these are 
clauses within statements) that set preference, and shows the types of 
routes to which each statement applies.  The default preference for each 
type of route is listed, and the table notes preference precedence between 
protocols.  The narrower the scope of the statement, the higher precedence 
its preference value is given, but the smaller the set of routes it 
affects.

<H2>Sample Preference Specifications</H2>
     
<PRE>
    interfaces {
	    interface 138.66.12.2 preference 10 ;
    } ;
    rip yes {
	preference 90 ;
    } ;
    import proto rip gateway 138.66.12.1 preference 75 ;
</PRE>

<P>In these statements the preference applicable to routes learned via RIP 
from gateway 138.66.12.1 is 75.  The last preference applicable to routes 
learned via RIP from gateway 128.66.12.1 is defined in the accept 
statement.  The preference applicable to other RIP routes is found in the 
rip statement.  The preference set on the interface statement applies only 
to the route to that interface.
