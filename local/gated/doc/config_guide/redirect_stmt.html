<H1>Redirect Processing</H1>

The <code>redirect</code> code is passed ICMP or ISO redirects learned
by monitoring ICMP messages, or via the routing socket on systems
that support it.  It processes the redirect request and decides
whether to accept the redirect.  If the redirect is accepted, the
a route is installed in the gated routing table with the protocol
<code>redirect</code>.  Redirects are deleted from the routing table
after 3 minutes.
<p>

If GateD determines that a redirect is not acceptable, it tries to
figure out if the kernel forwarding table has been modified.  On
systems where ICMP messages are monitored this is accomplished by
trying to second guess what the kernel would have done with the
redirect.  On systems with the routing socket, the kernel provides and
indication of whether the redirect was accepted; GateD ignores
redirects that were not processed.
<p>

If GateD has determined that the state of the kernel forwarding table
has been changed, the necessary requests to the kernel are made to
restore the correct state.
<p>

Note that on currently available systems it is not possible to disable
the processing of ICMP redirects, even when the system is functioning
as a router.  To ignore the effects of redirects, GateD must process
each one and actively restore any changes it made to the kernel's
state.  Because of the mechanism's involved there will be windows
where the effects of redirects are present in the kernel.
<p>

By default, GateD ignores redirects when actively participating in an
<a HREF="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway protocol</a> (RIP,
HELLO, OSPF or IS-IS).  It is not possible to enable redirects once
they have been automatically disabled.  Listening to RIP or HELLO in
<em>nobroadcast</em> mode does not cause redirects to be ignored, nor
does the use of EGP and BGP.  Redirects must be manually configured
off in these cases.
<p>

Note that in accordance with the latest IETF Router Requirements
document, GateD insures that all ICMP net redirects are processed as
host redirects.  When an ICMP net redirect is accepted, GateD issues
the requests to the kernel to make sure that the kernel forwarding
table is updated to reflect a host redirect instead of a net redirect.
<p>

The redirect statement does not prevent the system from sending
redirects, only from listening to them.

<H2>The Redirect Statement</H2>

<pre>
<strong>redirect</strong> <strong>yes</strong> | <strong>no</strong> | <strong>on</strong> | <strong>off</strong>
[ <strong>{</strong>
    <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var> 
        [ <strong>noredirects</strong> ] | [<strong>redirects</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>trustedgateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var> <strong>;</strong>
<strong>}</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
</PRE>
<p>
                 
<dl>
<dt> <strong>preference</strong>
<dd> Sets the preference for a route learned from a redirect.  The
     default is 30.
	
<dt> <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var>
<dd> The <CODE>interface</CODE> statement allows the enabling and
     disabling of redirects on an interface-by-interface basis.  See
     the section on <a href="intfcs.html#interface list">inteface
     list</a> specification for the description of the
     <var>interface_list</var>.  The possible parameters are:
                    
	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>noredirects</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that redirects received via the specified
	     interface will be ignored.  The default is to accept
	     redirects on all interfaces.
	<dt> <strong>redirects</strong>
	<dd> This is the default.  This argument may be necessary
	     when <code>noredirects</code> is used on a wildcard
	     interface descriptor.
	</dl>
     
<dt> <strong>trustedgateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var>
<dd> Defines the list of gateways from which redirects will be
     accepted.  The <var>gateway_list</var> is simply a list of host
     names or addresses.  By default, all routers on the shared
     network(s) are trusted to supply redirects.  But if the
     <CODE>trustedgateways</CODE> clause is specified only redirects
     from the gateways in the list are accepted.

	
<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> There are no redirect-specific tracing options.  All non-error
     messages are traced under the <code>normal</code> class.
</dl>

<hr>
<h2>Tracing options</h2>

There are no <CODE>Redirect</CODE>-specific tracing options.  All 
non-error messages are traced under the <CODE>normal</CODE> class.
