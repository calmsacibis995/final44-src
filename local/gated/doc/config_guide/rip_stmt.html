<H1>Routing Information Protocol (RIP)</H1>

One of the most widely used interior gateway protocols is the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP).  RIP is an implementation of a
distance-vector, or Bellman-Ford routing protocol for local networks.
It classifies routers as active and passive (silent).  Active routers
advertise their routes (reachability information) to others; passive
routers listen and update their routes based on advertisements, but do
not advertise.  Typically, routers run RIP in active mode, while hosts
use passive mode.
<P>
     
A router running RIP in active mode broadcasts updates at set
intervals.  Each update contains paired values where each pair
consists of an IP network address and an integer distance to that
network.  RIP uses a hop count metric to measure the distance to a
destination.  In the RIP metric, a router advertises directly
connected networks at a metric of 1.  Networks which are reachable
through one other gateway are two hops etc.  Thus, the number of hops
or hop count along a path from a given source to a given destination
refers to the number of gateways that a datagram would encounter along
that path.  Using hop counts to calculate shortest paths does not
always produce optimal results.  For example, a path with hop count 3
that crosses three Ethernets may be substantially faster that a path
with a hop count 2 that crosses two slow-speed serial lines.  To
compensate for differences in technology many routers advertise
artificially high hop counts for slow links.
<P>
     
As delivered with most UNIX systems, RIP is run by the routing 
daemon, <code>routed</code> (pronounced route-"d").  A RIP routing 
daemon dynamically builds on information received through RIP updates.  
When started up, it issues a REQUEST for routing information 
and then listens for responses to the request.  If a system configured
to supply RIP hears the request, it responds with a RESPONSE packet 
based on information in its routing database.  The RESPONSE packet 
contains destination network addresses and the routing metric for each 
destination.
<P>
     
When a RIP RESPONSE packet is received, the routing daemon takes the information 
and rebuilds the routing database adding new routes and "better" 
(lower metric) routes to destinations already listed in the database.
RIP also deletes routes from the database if the next router to that 
destination says the route contains more than 15 hops, or if the route 
is deleted.  All routes through a gateway are deleted if no updates 
are received from that gateway for a specified time period.  In 
general, routing updates are issued every 30 seconds.  In many 
implementations, if a gateway is not heard from for 180 seconds, all
routes from that gateway are deleted from the routing database.  This 
180 second interval also applies to deletion of specific routes.  
<P>

RIP version 2 (more commonly known as RIP II) add additional
capabilities to RIP.  Some of these capabilities are compatible with
RIP I and some are not.  To avoid supplying information to RIP I
routes that could be mis-interpreted, RIP II can only use
non-compatible features when it's packets are multicast.  On
interfaces that are not capable of IP multicast, RIP I compatible
packets are used that do not contain potentially confusing
information.
<P>
Some of the most notable RIP II enhancements are:

<dl>
<dt> Next hop
<dd> The primary ones are the ability to advertise a
     next hop to use other than the router supplying the routing update.
     This is quite useful when advertising a static route to a
     <em>dumb</em> that does not run RIP as it avoids having packets
     destined through the dumb router from having to cross a network
     twice.
     <P>
     RIP I routers will ignore next hop information in RIP II packets.
     This may result in packets crossing a network twice, which is
     exactly what happens with RIP I.  So this information is provided
     in RIP I compatible RIP II packets.

<dt> Network Mask
<dd> RIP I assumes that all subnetworks of a given network have the
     same network mask.  It uses this assumption to calculate the
     network masks for all routes received.  This assumption prevents
     subnets with different netmasks from being included in RIP
     packets.  RIP II adds the ability to explicitly specify the
     network mask with each network in a packet. 
     <P>
     While RIP I routers will ignore the network mask in RIP II
     packets, their calculation of the network mask will quite
     possibly be wrong.  For this reason, RIP I compatible RIP II
     packets must not contain networks that would be mis-interpreted.
     These network must only be provided in natve RIP II packets that
     are multicast.

<dt> Authentication
<dd> RIP II packets may also contain an authentication string that can
     be used to verify the validity of the supplied routing data.  The
     simple password method used provides very little security in the
     presence of network monitoring software.  Authentication can be
     used in RIP I compatible RIP II packets, but be aware that RIP I
     routers will ignore it.

</dl>

<p>
<h3> RIP-I and network masks

RIP-I derrives the network mask of received networks and hosts from
the network mask of the interface the packet via which the packet was
received.  If a received network or host is on the same natural
network as the interface over which it was received and that network
is subnetted (the specified mask is more specific than the
<em>natural</em> netmask), the subnet mask is applied to the
destination.  If bits outside the mask are set it is assumed to be a
host, otherwise it is assumed to be a subnet.  

<p>
On point-to-point interfaces, the netmask is applied to the remote
address.  The netmask on these interfaces is ignored if it matches the
natural network of the remote address or is all ones.

<p>
Unlike in previous releases, the zero subnet mask (a network that
matches the natural network of the interface, but has a more specific,
or longer, network mask) is ignored.  If this is not desirable, a <a
href="#route filter">route filter</a> may be used to reject it.

</pre>
<P>

The <CODE>rip</CODE> statement enables or disables RIP.  If the
<CODE>rip</CODE> statement is not specified the default is <CODE>rip
on ;</CODE>.  If enabled, RIP will assume <CODE>nobroadcast</CODE> when
there is only one interface and <CODE>broadcast</CODE> when there is
more than one.
<P>

The options are as follows:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>broadcast</strong>
<dd> Specifies that RIP packets will be broadcast regardless of the
number of interfaces present.  This is useful when propagating static
routes or routes learned from anther protocol into RIP.  In some
cases, the use of <code>broadcast</code> when only one network
interface is present can cause data packets to traverse a single
network twice.

<dt> <strong>nobroadcast</strong>
<dd> Specifies that RIP packets will not be broadcast on attached
interfaces, even if there are more than one.
If a <CODE>sourcegateways</CODE> clause is present, routes will still
be unicast directly to that gateway.

<dt> <strong>nocheckzero</strong>
<dd> Specifies that RIP should not make sure that reserved fields in
incoming version 1 RIP packets are zero.  Normally RIP will reject
packets where the reserved fields are zero.
     
<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Sets the preference for routes learned from RIP.  The default
preference is 100.  This preference may be overridden by a preference
specified in import policy.
	
<dt> <strong>defaultmetric</strong> <var>metric</var> 
<dd> Defines the metric used when advertising routes via RIP that were
learned from other protocols.  If not specified, the default value is
16 (unreachable).  This choice of values requires you to explicitly
specify a metric in order to export routes from other protocols into
RIP.  This metric may be overridden by a metric specified in export
policy.
	
<dt> <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var>
<dd> Controls various attributes of sending RIP on specific
     interfaces.  See the section on <a href="intfcs.html#interface
     list">inteface list</a> specification for the description of the
     <var>interface_list</var>.
     <p>
     Note that if there are multiple interfaces configured on the same
     subnet, HELLO updates will only be sent from first one one which
     HELLO output is configured.  This limitation is required because of
     the way the Unix kernel operates.  It will hopefully be removed
     in a future release. 
     <p>
     The possible parameters are:
                    
	<dl>
	<dt> <STRONG>noripin</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that RIP packets received via  the specified
	     interface will be ignored.  The default is to listen to
	     RIP on all interfaces.
	<dt> <STRONG>ripin</strong>
	<dd> This is the default.  This argument may be necessary
	     when <code>noripin</code> is used on a wildcard interface
	     descriptor.
	<dt> <strong>noripout</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that no RIP packets will be sent on the
	     specified interfaces.  The default is to send RIP on all
	     interfaces when in <code>broadcast</code> mode.
	<dt> <STRONG>ripout</strong>
	<dd> This is the default.  This argument may be necessary
	     when <code>noripin</code> is used on a wildcard interface
	     descriptor.

	<dt> <strong>metricin</strong> <var>metric</var>
	<dd> Specifies the RIP metric to add to incoming routes before
	     they are installed in the routing table.  The default is
	     the kernel interface metric plus 1 (which is the default
	     RIP hop count).  If this value is specified it will be
	     used as the absolute value, the kernel metric will not be
	     added.  This option is used to make this router prefer
	     RIP routes learned via the specified interface(s) less
	     than RIP routes from other interfaces. 

	<dt> <strong>metricout</strong> <var>metric</var>
	<dd> Specifies the RIP metric to be added to routes that are
	     send via the specified interface(s).  The default is
	     zero.  This option is used to make other routers prefer
	     other sources of RIP routes over this router.

	<dt> <strong>version 1</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that RIP packets send via the specified
	     interface(s) will be version 1 packets.  This is the
	     default.

	<dt> <strong>version 2</strong> 
	<dd> Specifies that RIP version 2 packets will be sent on the
	     specified interfaces(s).  If IP multicast support is
	     available on this interface the default is to send full
	     version 2 packets.  If it is not available, version 1
	     compatible version 2 packets will be sent.

	<dt> <strong>multicast</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that RIP version 2 packets should be multicast
	     on this interface.  This is the default.

	<dt> <strong>broadcast</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that RIP version 1 compatible version 2 packets
	     should be broadcast on this interface, even if IP
	     multicast is available.

	<dt> <strong>authentication</strong>
	<dd> This defines the authentication type to 
	     use.  It applies only to RIP version 2 and is 
	     ignored for RIP-1 packets.  The default 
	     authentication type is <CODE>none</CODE>.  If a 
	     password is specified, the authentication type 
	     used will be <CODE>simple</CODE>.  The password 
	     should be a quoted string with between 0 and 16 
	     characters.
                     	
        </dl>
                    
<dt> <strong>trustedgateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var>
<dd> Defines the list of gateways from which RIP will accept updates.
     The <var>gateway_list</var> is simply a list of host names or IP
     addresses.  By default, all routers on the shared network are
     trusted to supply routing information.  But if the
     <CODE>trustedgateways</CODE> clause is specified only updates
     from the gateways in the list are accepted.
	
<dt> <strong>sourcegateways</strong> <var>gateway_list</var>
<dd> Defines a list of routers to which RIP sends packets directly,
     not through multicast or broadcast.  Normally RIP packets are
     broadcast to all systems on a shared network.  When
     <code>sourcegateways</code> is specified, RIP packets are
     addressed directly to the specified gateways, even if
     <code>nobroadcast</code> is specified.


<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for RIP.
(See <A HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and the RIP specific
tracing options below.)
</dl>
                    
<hr>
<h2>Tracing options</h2>     

Packet tracing options (which may be modified with
<code>detail</code>, <code>send</code> or <code>recv</code>):
                    
<dl>
<dt> <strong>packets</strong>
<dd> All RIP packets.
	
<dt> <strong>request</strong>
<dd> RIP information request packets, such as
     <code>REQUEST</code>, <code>POLL</code> and
     <code>POLLENTRY</code>
	
<dt> <strong>response</strong>
<dd> RIP <code>RESPONSE</CODE> packets, which is the type of
     packet that actually contains routing
     information.
	
<dt> <strong>other</strong>
<dd> Any other type of packet.  The only valid
     ones are <code>TRACE_ON</code> and <code>TRACE_OFF</code> both of
     which are ignored.
