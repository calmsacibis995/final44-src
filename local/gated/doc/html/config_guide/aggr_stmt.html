<H1>Route Aggregation</H1>

<A NAME="aggr"></A><A NAME="generate"></A>

Route aggregation is a method of generating a more general route given
the presence of a specific route.  It is used, for example, at an
autonomous system border to generate a route to a network to be
advertised via EGP given the presence of one or more subnets of that
network learned via RIP.  Older versions of GateD automatically
performed this function, generating an aggregate route to a
<em>natural</em> network (using the old Class A, B and C concept)
given an interface to a subnet of that <em>natural</em> network.
However that was not always the correct thing to do, and with the
advent of classless interdomain routing it is even more frequently the
wrong thing to do, so aggregation must be explicitly configured.  No
aggregation is performed unless explicitly requested in an
<code>aggregate</code> statement. <p>

Route aggregation is also used by regional and national networks to 
reduce the amount of routing information passed around.  With careful 
allocation of network addresses to clients, regional networks can just 
announce one route to regional networks instead of hundreds. <p>

Aggregate routes are not actually used for packet forwarding by the
originator of the aggregate route, only by the receiver (if it
wishes).  A router receiving a packet which does not match one of the
component routes which led to the generation of an aggregate route is
supposed to respond with an ICMP <var>network unreachable</var>
message.  This is to prevent packets for unknown component routes from
following a default route into another network where they would be
forwarded back to the border router, and around and around again and
again, until their TTL expires.  Sending an unreachable message for a
missing piece of an aggregate is only possible on systems with support
for <a href="glossary.html#reject_route">reject routes</a>.  <p>

A slight variation of aggregation is the generation of a route based
on the existence of certain conditions.  This is sometimes known as
the <em>route of last resort</em>.  This route inherits the next hops
and aspath from the contributor specified with the lowest (most
favorable) preference.  The most common usage for this is to generate
a default based on the presence of a route from a peer on a
neighboring backbone.

Routes that match the route filters are called <em>contributing</em>
routes.  They are ordered according to the aggregation preference that
applies to them.  If there are more than one contributing routes with
the same aggregating preference, the route's own preferences are used
to order the routes.  The preference of the aggregate route will be
that of contributing route with the lowest aggregate preference.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Specifies the preference to assign to the resulting aggregate
     route.  The default preference is 130.
	
<dt> <strong>brief</strong>
<dd> Used to specify that the AS path should be truncated to the
     longest common AS path.  The default is to build an AS path
     consisting of SETs and SEQUENCEs of all contributing AS paths.

<dt> <var>proto</var>
<dd> In addition to the special protocols listed, the contributing
     protocol may be chosen from among any of the ones supported (and
     currently configured into) GateD.
     
<dt> <strong>restrict</STRONG>
<dd> Indicates that these routes are not to be considered as
     contributors of the specified aggregate.  The specified protocol
     may be any of the protocols supported by GateD. 

<dt> <var>route_filter</var>
<dd> See below.     
</dl>

A route may only contribute to an aggregate route which is more
general than itself; it must match the aggregate under its mask.
Any given route may only contribute to one aggregate route, which will
be the most specific configured, but an aggregate route may contribute
to a more general aggregate. <p>

<h2><a name="route filter">Route Filters</a></h2>

All the formats allow route filters as shown below.  See the section
on <a href="filter.html">route filters</a> for a detailed
explaination of how they work.  When no route filtering is specified
(i.e. when <code>restrict</code> is specified on the first line of a
statement), all routes from the specfied source will match that
statement.  If any filters are specified, only routes that match the
specified filters will be considered as contributors.  Put
differently, if any filters are specified, an <code>all restrict
;</code> is assumed at the end of the list.
