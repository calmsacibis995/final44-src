<h1>Matching AS paths</h1>

An AS path is a list of <a
href="glossary.html#autonomous_system">autonomous_systems</a> that
routing information has passed through to get to this router, and an
indicator of the origin of the AS path.  This information can be used
to prefer one path to a destination network over another.  The primary
method for doing this with GateD is to specify a list of patterns to
be applied to AS paths when <em><a
href="import_stmt.html">importing</a></em> and <em><a
href="export_stmt.html">exporting</a></em> routes. <p>

Each autonomous system that a route passed through prepends it's AS
number to the beginning of the AS path.  <p>

The origin information details the completeness of AS path
information.  An origin of <strong>igp</strong> indicates the route
was learned from an <a href="proto_over.html#igp">interior routing
protocol</a> and is most likely complete.  An origin of
<strong>egp</strong> indicates the route was learned from an <a
href="proto_over.html#egp">exterior routing protocol</a> that does
not support AS paths (<a href="proto_over.html#904">EGP</a> for
example) and the path is most likely not complete.  When the path
information is definitely not complete, an origin of
<strong>incomplete</strong> is used. <p>

AS path regular expressions are defined in <a
href="references.html#RFC 1164">RFC 1164</a> section 4.2.

<h2>AS path matching syntax</h2>

An AS path is matched using the following syntax.

<pre>
<strong>aspath</strong> <var>aspath_regexp</var> <strong>origin</strong> <strong>any</strong> | ( [ <strong>igp</strong> ] [<strong>egp</strong> ] [ <strong>incomplete</strong> ] )
</pre>

This specifies that an AS matching the <var>aspath_regexp</var> with
the specified origin is matched.

<h2>AS path regular expressions</h2>

Technically, an AS path regular expression is a regular expression
with the alphabet being the set of AS numbers.  An AS path regular
expression is composed of one or more AS paths expressions.  An AS
path expressions is composed of AS path terms and AS path operators.

<h3>AS path terms</h3>

An AS path term is one of the following three objects:

<pre>
    <var>autonomous_system</var>
    <strong>.</strong>
    <strong>(</strong> <var>aspath_regexp</var> <strong>)</strong>
</pre>

<dl>
<dt> <var>autonomous_system</var>
<dd> Is any valid autonomous system number, from one through 65534
     inclusive.

<dt> <strong>.</strong>
<dd> matches any autonomous system number.

<dt> <strong>(</strong> <var>aspath_regexp</var> <strong>)</strong>
<dd> parentheses group subexpressions--an operator, such as
     <code>*</code> or <code>?</code> works on a single element or on a
     regular expression enclosed in parentheses
</dl>

<h3>AS path operators</h3>

An AS path operator is one of the following:

<pre>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m,n}</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m}</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m,}</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>*</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>+</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>?</strong>
    <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>|</strong> <var>aspath_term</var>
</pre>

<dl>
<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m,n}</strong>
<dd> a regular expression followed by <code>{m,n}</code> (where m
     and n are both non-negative integers and m &lt;= n) means at least
     <em>m</em> and at most <em>n</em> repetitions.

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m}</strong>
<dd> a regular expression followed by <code>{m}</code> (where m is
     a positive integer) means exactly <em>m</em> repetitions.

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>{m,}</strong>
<dd> a regular expression followed by <code>{m,}</code> (where m is a
     positive integer) means <em>m or more</em> repetitions. 

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>*</strong>
<dd> an AS path term followed by <code>*</code> means <em>zero or
     more</em> repetitions.  This is shorthand for <code>{0,}</code>.

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>+</strong>
<dd> a regular expression followed by <code>+</code> means <em>one or
     more</em> repetitions.  This is shorthand for <code>{1,}</code>.

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>?</strong>
<dd> a regular expression followed by <code>?</code> means
     <em>zero</em> or <em>one</em> repetition.  This is shorthand for
     <code>{0,1}</code>.

<dt> <var>aspath_term</var> <strong>|</strong> <var>aspath_term</var>
<dd> matches the AS term on the left, or the AS term on the right.
</dl>
