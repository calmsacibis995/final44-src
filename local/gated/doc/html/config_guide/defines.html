<H1>Definition Statements</H1>

Definition statements are general configuration statements that relate
to all of GateD or at least to more than one protocol.  The three
definition statements are <code>autonomoussystem</code>,
<code>routerid</code> and <code>martians</code>.  if used,
<code>autonomoussystem</code>, <code>routerid</code> and
<code>martians</code> must appear before any other type of
configuration statement in gated.conf file.

<hr>
<h2>Autonomous System configuration</h2>
<pre>
    <strong><a name="asno">autonomoussystem</a></strong> <var><a href="glossary.html#autonomous_system">autonomous_system</a></var> [ <strong>loops</strong> <var><a href="glossary.html#number">number</a></var> ] <strong>;</strong>
</pre>

Sets the autonomous system number of this router to be
<code>autonomous  system</code>.  This option is required if BGP or
EGP are in use. The AS number is assigned by the Network Information
Center (NIC). <P> 
                    
<code>Loops</code> is only for protocols supporting AS paths, such as
BGP.  It controls the number of times this autonomous system may
appear in an AS path and defaults to 1 (one). 

<hr>
<h2>Router ID configuration</h2>

<pre>
    <strong>routerid</strong> <var><a href="glossary.html#host">host</a></var> <strong>;</strong>
</pre>

Sets the router identifier for use by the BGP and OSPF protocols.
The  default is the address of the first interface encountered by
GateD.   The  address  of a non-point-to-point interface is preferred
over the local address of a point-to-point interface and an address on
a loopback interface that is not the loopback address (127.0.0.1) is
most preferred.  

<hr>
<h2>Martian configuration</h2>

<pre>
    <strong>martians</strong> <strong>{</strong>
        <strong>host</strong> <var>host</var> [ <strong>allow</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
	<var>network</var> [ <strong>allow</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
	<var>network</var> <strong>mask</strong> <var>mask</var> [ <strong>allow</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
	<var>network</var> <strong>masklen</strong> <var>number</var> [ <strong>allow</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
        <strong>default</strong> [ <strong>allow</strong> ] <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>}</strong> <strong>;</strong> 
</pre>

Defines a list of <em>martian</em> addresses about which all routing
information is ignored. Sometimes a misconfigured system sends out
obviously invalid destination addresses.  These invalid addresses,
called martians, are rejected by the routing software. This command
allows additions to the list of martian addresses.  See the section on
<a href="filter.html">Route Filtering</a> for more information on
specifying ranges.  Also, the <code>allow</code> parameter may be
specified to explicitly allow a subset of a range that was disallowed.

<H2>Sample Definition Statements</H2>

<PRE>
    options gendefault ; 
    autonomoussystem 249 ;
    interface 128.66.12.2 passive ;
    martians {
        0.0.0.26
    };
</PRE>
     
<P>The   statements  in  the  sample  perform   the   following
     functions:

     <P>
     <UL>
     <LI> The options statement tells the system to generate  a
     default route when it peers with an EGP or   BGP neighbor.
     <LI> The autonomoussystem statement tells GateD to use  AS
     number 249 for in EGP and BGP.
     <LI> The  interface statement tells GateD  not  to  mark interface 
     128.66.12.2 as down even if it sees no traffic.
     <LI> The martians statement prevents routes to 0.0.0.26 from
     ever being accepted.
     </UL>
