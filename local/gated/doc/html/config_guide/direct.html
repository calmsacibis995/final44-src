<H1>Directive Statements</H1>

Directive statements provide direction to the GateD configuration
language parser about included files and the directories in which
these files reside.  Directive statements are immediately acted upon
by the parser.  Other statements terminate with a semi-colon (;), but
directive statements terminate with a newline.  The two directive
statements are:
     
<dl>
<dt> <A name="directory"><strong>%directory</strong> "<var>directory</var>"</a>
<dd> Defines the directory where the include files are stored.  When
     it is used, GateD looks in the directory identified by pathname
     for any included files that do not have a fully qualified
     filename i.e. do not begin with "/".  This statement does not
     actually change the current the directory, it just specifies the
     prefix applied to included file names. 
	
<dt> <A NAME="include"><strong>%include</strong> "<var>filename</var>"</a> 
<dd> Identifies an include file.  The contents of the file is
     <em>included</em> in the gated.conf file at the point in the
     gated.conf file where the <code>%include</code> directive is
     encountered.  If the filename is not fully qualified, i.e. does
     not begin with "/", it is considered to be relative to the
     directory defined in the <code>%directory</code> directive.  The
     <code>%include</code> directive statement causes the specified
     file to be parsed completely before resuming with this file.
     Nesting up to ten levels is supported.  The maximum nesting level
     may be increased by changing the definition of
     <strong>FI_MAX</strong> in <code>parse.h</code>.
</dl>

In a complex environment, segmenting a large configuration into smaller 
more easily understood segments might be helpful, but one of the great 
advantages of GateD is that it combines the configuration of several 
different routing protocols into a single file.  Segmenting a small file 
unnecessarily complicates routing configurations.
