<H1>The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)</H1>

The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is an exterior routing protocol
used for exchanging routing information with gateways in other
autonomous systems.  Unlike interior protocols, EGP propagates only
reachability indications, not true metrics.  EGP updates contain
metrics, called <em>distances</em> which range from 0 to 255.  GateD
will only compare EGP distances learned from the same AS.
them.
<p>

Before EGP sends routing information to a remote router, it must
establish an adjacency with that router.
This is accomplished by an
exchange of <em>Hello</em> (not to be confused with the HELLO
protocol, or OSPF HELLO messages) and <em>I Heard You</em> (I-H-U)
messages with that router.
Computers communicating via EGP are called
EGP <em>neighbors</em>, and the exchange of HELLO and I-H-U messages is
referred to as <em>acquiring a neighbor</em>.
Once the neighbor is acquired,
the system <em>polls</em> the neighbor for routing information.
The neighbor
responds by sending an <em>update</em> containing routing information.
If the system receives a poll from
its neighbor, it responds with its own update packet.  When the system
receives an update, it includes routes from the update into its
routing database.  If the neighbor fails to respond to three
consecutive polls, GateD assumes that the neighbor is down and removes
the neighbor's routes from its database.

</PRE>

<dl>
<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
<dd> Sets the preference for routes learned from RIP.  The default
     preference is 200.  This preference may be overridden by a
     preference specified on the <code>group</code> or
     <code>neighbor</code> statments or by import policy.

<dt> <strong>defaultmetric</strong> <var>metric</var> <strong>;</strong> 
<dd> Defines the metric used when advertising routes via EGP.  If not
     specified, the default value is 255 which some systems may
     consider unreachable.  This choice of values requires you to
     explicitly specify a metric when exporting routes to EGP
     neighbors.  This metric may be overridden by a metric specified
     on the neighbor or group statements or in export policy.

<dt> <strong>packetsize</strong> <var>maxpacketsize</var>
<dd> This defines the expected maximum size of a packet that EGP
     expects to receive from this neighbor.  If a packet larger than
     this value is received, it will be incomplete and have to be
     discarded.  The length of this packet will be noted and the
     expected size will be increased to be able to receive a packet of
     this size.  Specifying the parameter here will prevent the first
     packet from being dropped.  If not specified, the default size is
     8192 bytes.  All packet sizes are rounded up to a multiple of the
     system page size.

<dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies the tracing options for EGP.  By default these are
     inherited from the global trace options.  These values may be
     overridden on a group or neighbor basis. (See <A
     HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and the EGP specific
     tracing options below.)

<dt> <strong>group</strong>
<dd> EGP neighbors must be specified as members of a
     <code>group</code>.  A group is usually used to group all
     neighbors in one autonomous system.  Parameters specified on the
     group clause apply to all of the subsidiary neighbors unless
     explicitly overridden on a neighbor clause.  Any number of
     <code>group</code> clauses may specify any number of
     <code>neighbor</code> clauses. 
     <p>

     Any parameters from the <CODE>neighbor</CODE> subclause may be
     specified on the <CODE>group</CODE> clause to provide defaults
     for the whole group (which may be overridden for individual
     neighbors).  In addition, the <CODE>group</CODE> clause is the
     only place to set the following attributes: 

     <dl>
     <dt> <strong>peeras</strong>
     <dd> Identifies the  autonomous system number expected from peers
          in the group.  If not specified it will be learned
          dynamically.

     <dt> <strong>localas</strong>
     <dd> Identifies the autonomous system which GateD is representing
          to the group. The  default is that which has been set
          globally in the <A
          HREF="defines.html#asno"><CODE>autonomoussystem</CODE></A>
          statement.  This option is usually only used when
          <em>masquerading</em> as another autonomous system and it's
          use is discouraged.
	
     <dt> <strong>maxup</strong>
     <dd> Specifies the number of neighbors GateD should acquire from
          this group. The default is to acquire all of the neighbors
          in the group.  GateD will attempt to acquire the first
          <code>maxup</code> neighbors in the order listed.  If one of
          the first neighbors is not available, it will acquire one
          further down the list. If after start-up GateD does manage
          to acquire the more desirable neighbor, it will drop the
          less desirable one.
     </dl>

<dt> <strong>neighbor</strong> <var>neighbor_address</var>
<dd> Each neighbor subclause defines one EGP neighbor within a group.
     The only part of the subclause that is required is the
     <code>neighbor_address</code> argument which is the symbolic host
     name or IP address of the neighbor.  All other parameters are
     optional.

    <dl>     
    <dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
    <dd> Specifies  the  preference  used  for  routes learned  from
         these  neighbors.   This  can differ from the default EGP
         preference set in the <code>egp</code> statement, so that
         GateD can prefer routes from one neighbor, or group of
         neighbors, over another.  This preference may be explicitly
         overriden by import policy.

    <dt> <strong>preference2</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
    <dd> In the case of a <code>preference</code> tie, the second
         preference, <code>preference2</code> may be used to break the
         tie.  The default value is 0.

    <dt> <strong>metricout</strong> <var>metric</var>
    <dd> This defines a metric to be used for all routes sent to this
         neighbor.  The value overrides the default metric set in the
         <code>egp</code> statement and any metrics specified by
         export policy, but only for this specific neighbor or group
         of neighbors.
	
    <dt> <strong>nogendefault</strong>
    <dd> Prevents GateD from generating a default route when EGP
         receives a valid update from its neighbor.  The default route
         is only generated when the <a
         href="options.html#gendefault">gendefault</a> option is
         enabled.
	
    <dt> <strong>importdefault</strong>
    <dd> Enables GateD to accept the default route (0.0.0.0) if it is
         included in a received EGP update.  If not specified, the
         default route contained in an EGP update is ignored.  For
         efficiency, some networks have external routers announce a
         default route to avoid sending large EGP update packets.
	
    <dt> <strong>exportdefault</strong>
    <dd> Enables GateD to include the default route (0.0.0.0) in EGP
         updates sent to this EGP neighbor.  This allows the system to
         advertise the default route via EGP. Normally a default route
         is not included in EGP updates.
	
    <dt> <strong>gateway</strong> <var>gateway</var>
    <dd> If a network is not shared with a neighbor,
         <code>gateway</code> specifies a router on an attached
         network to be used as the next hop router for routes received
         from this neighbor.  This option is only rarely used.

    <dt> <strong>lcladdr</strong> <var>local_address</var> <dd>
    <dd> Specifies the address to be used on the local end of the
         connection with the neighbor.  The local address must be on
         an interface which is shared with the neighbor or with the
         neighbor's <em>gateway</em> when the <code>gateway</code>
         parameter is used.  A sessionwill only be opened when an
         interface with the appropriate local address (through which
         the neighbor or gateway address is directly reachable) is
         operating.
	
    <dt> <strong>sourcenet</strong> <var>network</var>
    <dd> Specifies the network queried in the EGP Poll packets.  By
         default this is the network shared with neighbors address
         specified.  If there is no network shared with the neighbor,
         one of the network the neighbor is attached to should be
         specified.  This parameter can also be used to specify a
         network shared with the neighbor other than the one on which the
         EGP packets are sent.  This parameter is normally not needed.
         
    <dt> <strong>p1</strong> <var>time</var>
    <dt> <strong>minhello</strong> <var>time</var>
    <dd> Sets the minimum acceptable interval between the transmission
         of EGP <em>HELLO</em> packets.  The default hello interval is
         30 seconds.  If the neighbor fails to respond to three hello
         packets, GateD stops trying to acquire the neighbor.  Setting
         a larger interval gives the neighbor a better chance to
         respond.  Minhello is an alias for the <code>P1</code> value
         defined in the EGP specification.
	
    <dt> <strong>p2</strong> <var>time</var>
    <dt> <strong>minpoll</strong> <var>time</var>
    <dd> Sets the time interval between polls to the neighbor.  The
         default is 120 seconds.  If three polls are sent without a
         response, the neighbor is declared "down" and all routes
         learned from that neighbor are removed from the routing
         database.  A longer polling interval supports a more stable
         routing database but is not as responsive to routing changes.
         Minpoll is an alias for the <code>P2</code> value defined in
         the EGP specification.

    <dt> <strong>ttl</strong> <var>ttl</var>
    <dd> By default, GateD sets the IP TTL for local neighbors to
         <em>one</em> and the TTL for non-local neighbors to 255.  This
         option is provided when attempting to communicate with
         improperly functioning routers that ignore packets sent with
         a TTL of one.

    <dt> <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
    <dd> Specifies the tracing options for this EGP neighbor.  By
         default these are inherited from group or EGP global trace
         options. (See <A HREF="trace.html">Trace Statements</A> and
         the EGP specific tracing options below.)
