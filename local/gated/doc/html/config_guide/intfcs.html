An interface is the connection between a router and one of its
attached networks.  A physical interface may be specified by interface
name, by IP address, or by domain name, (unless the network is an
unnumbered point-to-point network.) Multiple levels of reference in
the configuration language allow identification of interfaces using
wildcard, interface type name, or delete word address.  Be careful
with the use of interface names as future Unix operating systems may
allow more than one address per interface.  The interface_list is a
list of one or more interface names including wildcard names (names
without a number) and names which may specify more than one interface
or address, or the token <CODE>all</CODE> for all interfaces.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>options</strong>     
<dd> Allows configuration of some global options related to
     interfaces.  These are:
                    
	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>strictinterfaces</strong>
	<dd> Indicates that it is a fatal error to reference an
	     interface in the configuration file that is not present
	     when GateD is started and not listed in a
	     <code>define</code> statement.  Without this option a
	     warning message will be issued but GateD will continue.
                    	
	<dt> <strong>scaninterval</strong> <var>time</var>
	<dd> Specifies how often GateD scans the kernel interface list
	     for changes.  The default is every 15 seconds on most
	     systems, and 60 seconds on systems that pass interface
	     status changes through the routing socket e.g. BSD 4.4).
	     Note that GateD will also scan the interface list on
	     receipt of a <code>SIGUSR2</code>.
	</dl>
                          
<dt> <strong>interface</strong> <var><a href="intfcs.html#interface list">interface_list</a></var>
<dd> Sets interface options on the specified interfaces.  An interface
     list is <code>all</code> or a list of interface names (see
     warning about interface names), domain names, or numeric
     addresses.  Options available on this statement are:

	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
	<dd> Sets the preference for routes to this interface when it
	     is up and appears to be functioning properly.  The
	     default preference is <code>0</code>.
                      	
	<dt> <strong>down preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var>
	<dd> Sets the preference for routes to this interface when
	     GateD does not believe it to be functioning properly, but
	     the kernel does not indicate it is down.  The default
	     value is <code>120</code>.
                      	
	<dt> <strong>passive</strong>
	<dd> Prevents GateD from changing the preference of the route
	     to this interface if it is not believed to be functioning
	     properly due to lack of received routing information.
	     GateD will only perform this check if the interface is
	     actively participating in a routing protocol and the
	     interface is not reported as being <em><a
	     href="glossary.html#simplex">simplex</a></em>.
                      	
	<dt> <strong>simplex</strong>
	<dd> Defines an interface as unable to hear its own broadcast
	     packets.  Currently, defining an interface as simplex is
	     functionally equivalent to defining it as passive.
                      	
	<dt> <strong>reject</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that the address of the interface which matches
	     these criteria will be used as the local address when
	     installing <em>reject</em> routes  in the kernel.  Should
	     only be used with systems based on BSD 4.3 Tahoe or
	     earlier which have installed a reject/blackhole psuedo
	     interface.
                      	
	<dt> <strong>blackhole</strong>
	<dd> Specifies that the address of the interface which matches
	     these criteria will be used as the local address when
	     installing <em>reject</em> routes  in the kernel.  Should
	     only be used with systems based on BSD 4.3 Tahoe or
	     earlier which have installed a reject/blackhole psuedo
	     interface.
	</dl>
<dt> <strong>define</strong> <var>address</var>
<dd> Defines interfaces that might not be present when GateD is
     started so they may be referenced in the configuration file when
     <code>strictinterfaces</code> is defined. Possible
     <code>define</code> keywords are:
                    
	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>broadcast</strong> <var>address</var>
	<dd> Defines the interface as broadcast capable (e.g. Ethernet
             or Token Ring) and specifies the broadcast address. 
	
	<dt> <strong>pointopoint</strong> <var>address</var>
	<dd> Defines the interface as a pointopoint interface (e.g.
             SLIP or PPP) and specifies the address on the local side.
             The first <var>address</var> on the <code>define</code>
             statement references the address of the host on the
             <strong>remote</strong> end of the interface, the
             <var>address</var> specified after this
             <code>pointopoint</code> keyword defines the address on
             the <strong>local</strong> side of the interface.
	</dl>

     An interface not defined as broadcast or pointopoint is assumed
     to be non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA), such as an X.25 network.

	<dl>
	<dt> <strong>netmask</strong> <var>mask</var>
	<dd> Specifies the subnetmask to be used on this interface.
             This is ignored on pointtopoint interfaces.
                    
	<dt> <strong>multicast</strong> 
	<dd> Specifies that the interface is multicast capable.
	</dl>
</dl>

<h2><a name="interface list">Interface lists</a></h2>

An interface list is a list of references to interfaces or groups of
interfaces.  There are four methods available for refering to
interfaces.  They are listed here from most general to most specific.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>all</strong>
<dd> This refers to all available interfaces.

<dt> Interface name wildcard
<dd> This refers to all the interfaces of the same type.  Unix
     interfaces consist of the name of the device driver, like
     <code>ie</code>, and a unit number, like <code>0</code>,
     <code>5</code> or <code>22</code>.  Reference to the name contain
     only alphabetic characters and match any interfaces that have the
     same alphabetic part.
     <p>

     For example, <code>ie</code> on a Sun would refer to all Interlan
     Ethernet interfaces, <code>le</code> would refer to all Lance
     Ethernet interfaces.  But <code>ie</code> would not match
     <code>iel0</code>. 

<dt> Interface name
<dd> This refers to a specific interface, usually one physical
     interface.  These are specified as an alphabetic part followed by
     a numeric part.  This will match one specific interface.  But be
     aware that on many systems, there can be more than one protocol
     (i.e. <em>IP</em>) address on a given physical interface.

     For example, <code>ef1</code> will match an interface named
     <code>ef1</code>, but not an interface named <code>ef10</code>.

<dt> Interface address
<dd> This matches one specific interface.  The reference can be by
     protocol address (i.e. <em>10.0.0.51</em>), or by symbolic
     hostname (i.e.  <em>nic.ddn.mil</em>).  Note that a symbolic
     hostname reference is only valid when it resolves to only one
     address.  Use of symbolic hostnames is not recommended.
</dl>

If many interface lists are present in the config file with more than
one parameter, these parameters are collected at run-time to create
the specific parameter list for a given interface.  If the same
parameter is specified on more than one list, the parameters with the
most specific interface is used. <p>

For example, consider a system with three interfaces,
<code>le0</code>, <code>le1</code> and <code>du0</code>.

<pre><code>
    rip yes {
        interface all noripin noripout ;
	interface le ripin ;
	interface le1 ripout ;
    } ;
</code></pre>

RIP packets would only be accepted from interfaces <code>le0</code>
and <code>le1</code>, but not from <code>du0</code>.  RIP packets
would only be sent on interface <code>le1</code>.

<h2>IP Interface addresses and routes</h2>

The <em>BSD 4.3</em> and later networking implementations allow four
types of interfaces.  Some implementations allow multiple protocol
addresses per physical interface, these are mostly based on <em>BSD
4.3 Reno</em> or later.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>loopback</strong>
<dd> This interface must have the address of
     <strong>127.0.0.1</strong>.  Packets sent to this interface are
     sent back to the originator.  This interface is also used as a
     catch all interface for implementing other features, such as
     <em>reject</em> and <em>blackhole</em> routes.  Although a
     netmask is reported on this interface, it is ignored.  It is
     useful to assign an address to this interface that is the same as
     the OSPF or BGP <em>router id</em>; this allows routing to a
     system based on the <em>router id</em> which will work if some
     interfaces are down.

<dt> <strong>broadcast</strong>
<dd> This is a multi-access interface capable of a physical level
     broadcast, such as <em>Ethernet</em>, <em>Token Ring</em> and
     <em>FDDI</em>.  This interface has an associatted subnet mask and
     broadcast address.  The interface route to an <em>broadcast</em>
     network will be a route to the complete subnet.

<dt> <strong>point-to-point</strong>
<dd> This is a <em>tunnel</em> to another host, usually on some sort
     of <em>serial</em> link.  This interface has a <em>local</em>
     address, and a <em>remote</em> address.  Although it may be
     possible to specify multiple addresses for a
     <em>point-to-point</em> interface, there does not seem to be a
     useful reason for doing so. <p>

     The <em>remote</em> address must be unique amoung all the
     interface addresses on a given router.  The <em>local</em>
     address may be shared amoung many <em>point-to-point</em> and up
     to one non-<em>point-to-point</em> interface.  This is
     technically a form of the <em>router id</em> method for
     addressless links.  This technique conserves subnets as non are
     required when using this technique. <p>

     If a subnet mask is specified on a <em>point-to-point</em>
     interface, it is only used by RIP verison 1 and HELLO to
     determine which subnets may be propagated to the router on the
     other side of this interface. <p>

<dt> <strong>non-broadcast multi-access</strong> or <strong>nbma</strong>
<dd> This type of interface is multi-access, but not capable of
     broadcast.  And example would be <em>frame relay</em> and
     <em>X.25</em>.  This type of interface has a local address and a
     subnet mask.     
</dl>

GateD insures that there is a route available to each IP interface
that is configured and up.  Normally this this done by the
<em>ifconfig</em> command that configures the interface; GateD does it
to insure consistency. <p>

For <em>point-to-point</em> interfaces, gated installs some special
routes.  If the <em>local</em> address on one or more
<em>point-to-point</em> intefaces is not shared with a
non-<em>point-to-point</em> interface, gated installs a route to the
<em>local</em> address pointing at the <em>loopback</em> interface
with a preference of 110.  This insures that packets originating on
this host destined for this <em>local</em> address are handled
locally.  OSPF prefers to route packets for the <em>local</em>
interface across the <em>point-to-point</em> link where they will be
returned by the router on the remote end.  This is used to verify
operation of the link.  Since OSPF installs routes with a preference
of 10, these routes will override the route installed with a
preference of 110. <p>

If the <em>local</em> address of one or more <em>point-to-point</em>
interfaces is shared with a non-<em>point-to-point</em> interface,
gated installs a route to the <em>local</em> with a preference of 0
that will not be installed in the forwarding table.  This is to
prevent protocols like OSPF from routing packets to this address
across a serial interface when this system could be functioning as a
<em>host</em>. <p>

When the status of an interface changes, GateD notifies all the
protocols, which take the appropriate action.  GateD assumes that
interfaces which are not marked <em>UP</em> do not exist.  While this
might not be the most correct action, it is the way things currently
work. <p>

GateD ignores any interfaces that have invalid data for the
<em>local</em>, <em>remote</em> or <em>broadcast</em> addresses or the
<em>subnet mask</em>.  Invalid data includes zeros in any field.
GateD will also ignore any <em>point-to-point</em> interface that has
the same local and remote addresses, it assumes it is in some sort of
<em>loopback test</em> mode.
