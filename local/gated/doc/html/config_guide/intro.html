<h1>Introduction to Configuring Gated</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

The gated config file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`<code>;</code>').  Statements are composed of tokens
separated by white space, which can be any combination of blanks, tabs
and newlines.  This structure simplifies identification of the parts
of the configuration associated with each other and with specific
protocols.  Comments may be specified in either of two forms.  One
form begins with a pound sign (`<code>#</code>') and runs to the end
of the line.  The other form, <em>C</em> style, starts with a `/*'
and continues until it reaches `*/'.

<h4>Syntax description conventions</h4>

Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using the HTML <strong>strong</strong> style.  Parameters
are specifying in the HTML <var>variable definition</var> style.
Parameters shown in square brakets (`<code>[</code>' and
`<code>]</code>') are used to show optional keywords and parameters.
The vertical bar (`<code>|</code>') is used to indicate between a
choice of optional parameters.  Parentheses (`<code>(</code>' and
`<code>)</code>') are used to group keywords and parameters when
necessary. <p>

For example, in the syntax description:

<pre>
    [ <strong>backbone</strong> | ( <strong>area</strong> <var>area</var> ) ]
</pre>

The square brakets say that either parameter is optional.  The
keywords are <strong>backbone</strong> and <strong>area</strong>.
The vertical bar indicates that either ``<strong>backbone</strong>''
or ``<strong>area</strong> <var>area</var>'' may be specified.  Since
<var>area</var> is in the <var>variable definition</var> style, it is
a parameter that needs to be provided.

<h3>Statement Grouping</h3>

The configuration statements and the order in which these
statements appear divide gated.conf into options statements, interface
statements, definition statements, protocol statements, static
statements, control statements, and aggregate statements.  Entering a
statement out of order causes an error when parsing the configuration
file.  <p>

Two other types of statements do not fit in these categories:
%directive statements and %trace statements.  These statements provide
instructions to the parser and control tracing from the configuration
file.  They do not relate to the configuration of any protocol and may
occur anywhere in the gated.conf file.

<H3>Statement Summary</H3>

A summary table of the configuration statements (in the <A
HREF="statements.html">configuration statement summary</A>) lists
each GateD config statement by name, identifies the statement type,
and provides a short synopsis of the command's function.  More
detailed definitions and descriptions of each of the eight classes of
GateD statements follow in separate sections. <p>
