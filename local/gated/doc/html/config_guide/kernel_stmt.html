<H1>The Kernel Statement</H1>

While the kernel interface isn't technically a routing protocol, it
has many characteristics of one, and GateD handles handles it
similarly to one.  The routes GateD chooses to install in the kernel
forwarding table are those that will actually be used by the kernel to
forward packets.
<P>

The add, delete and change operations GateD must use to update the 
typical kernel forwarding table take a non-trivial amount of time.  
This does not present a problem for older routing protocols (RIP, 
EGP), which are not particularly time critical and do not easily 
handle very large numbers of routes anyway.  The newer routing 
protocols (OSPF, BGP) have stricter timing requirements and are often 
used to process many more routes.  The speed of the kernel interface 
becomes critical when these protocols are used.
<P>

To prevent GateD from locking up for significant periods of time 
installing large numbers of routes (up to a minute or more has been 
observed on real networks), the processing of these routes is now done 
in batches.  The size of these batches may be controlled by the tuning 
parameters described below, but normally the default parameters will 
provide the proper functionality.

<h2>Forwarding tables and Routing tables</h2>

The table in the kernel that controls the forwarding of packets is a
<em>forwarding table</em>, also know in ISO speak as a <em>forwarding
information base</em>, or <em>FIB</em>.  The table that GateD uses
internally to store routing information it learns from routing
protocols is a <em>routing table</em>, known in ISO speak as a
<em>routing information base</em>, or <em>RIB</em>.  The routing table
is used to collect and store routes from various protocols.  For each
unique combination of <em>network</em> and <em>mask</em> an
<em>active</em> route is chosen, this route will be the one with the
best (numerically smallest) <em>preference</em>.  All the active
routes are installed in the kernel forwarding table.  The entries in
this table are what the kernel actually uses to forward packets.

<h2>Updating the Forwarding Table</h2>

There are two main methods of updating the kernel <em>FIB</em>, the
<em>ioctl</em> interface and the <em>routing socket</em> interface.
Their various characteristics are described here.

<h3>Updating the Forwarding Table with the ioctl interface</h3>

The <em>ioctl</em> interface to the forwarding table was introduced in
<em>BSD 4.3</em> and widely distributed in <em>BSD 4.3</em>.  This is
a one-way interface, it only allows GateD to update the kernel
forwarding table.  It has several other limitations:

<dl>
<dt> Fixed subnet masks
<dd> The BSD 4.3 networking code assumed that all subnets of a given
     network had the same subnet mask.  This limitation is enforced
     by the kernel.  The network mask is not stored in the kernel
     forwarding table, but determined when a packet is forwarded by
     searching for interfaces on the same network.

<dt> One way interface
<dd> GateD is able to update the kernel forwarding table, but it is
     not aware of other modifications of the forwarding table.  GateD
     is able to listen to ICMP messages and guess how the kernel has
     updated the forwarding table with response to ICMP redirects.

<dt> Blind updates
<dd> GateD is not able to detect changes to the forwarding table
     resulting from the use of the the <em>route</em> command by the
     system administrator.  Use of the <em>route</em> command on
     systems that use the ioctl interface is strongly discouraged
     while GateD is running.

<dt> Changes not supported
<dd> In all known implementations, there is no change operation
     supported, to change a route that exists in the kernel, the route
     must be deleted and a new one added.

</dl>

<h3><a name="routing_socket">Updating the Forwarding Table with the routing socket interface</a></h3>

The <em>routing socket</em> interface to the kernel forwarding table
was introduced in <em>BSD 4.3 Reno</em>, widely distributed in <em>BSD
4.3 Net/2</em> and improved in <em>BSD 4.4</em>.  <!-- XXX - Document
reference!> This interface is simply a socket, similar to a UDP
socket, on which the kernel and GateD exchange messages.  It has
several advatages over the ioctl interface:

<dl>
<dt> Variable subnet masks
<dd> The network mask is passed to the kernel explicitly.  This allows
     different masks to be used on subnets of the same network.  It
     also allows routes with masks that are more general than the
     natural mask to be used.  This is known as classless routing.
     <!-- XXX - CIDR reference?>

<dt> Two way interface
<dd> Not only is GateD able to change the kernel forwarding table with
     this interface, but the kernel can also report changes to the
     forwarding table to GateD.  The most interesting of these is an
     indication that a redirect has modified the kernel forwarding
     table; this means that gated no longer needs to monitor ICMP
     messages to learn about redirects.  Plus, there is an indication
     of whether the kernel processed the redirect, GateD can safely
     ignore redirect messages that the kernel did not process.

<dt> Updates visible
<dd> Changes to the routing table by other processes, including the
     <em>route</em> command are received via the routing socket.  This
     allows GateD to insure that the kernel forwarding table is in
     sync with the routing table.  Plus it allows the system
     administrator the ability to do some operations with the
     <em>route</em> command while gated is running.
     
<dt> Changes supported
<dd> There is a functioning <em>change</em> message that allows routes
     in the kernel to be atomically changed.
     
<dt> Expandable
<dd> New levels of kernel/GateD communications may be added by adding
     new message types.

</dl>

<h2>Reading the Forwarding Table</h2>

When GateD starts up it reads the kernel forwarding table and installs
corresponding routes in the routing table.  These routes are timed out
and deleted after 3 minutes.  This allows forwarding to occur during
the time it takes the routing protocols to start learning routes.
There are three main methods for reading the forwarding table from the
kernel.

<h3>Reading forwarding table via kmem</h3>

On many systems, especially those based on BSD 4.3, GateD must have
knowledge of the kernel's data structures and poke around in the
kernel to read the current state of forwarding table.  This method is
slow and subject to error if the kernel forwarding table is updated
while GateD is in the middle of reading it.  This can happen if the
system administrator uses the <em>route</em> command, or an ICMP
redirect message is received while GateD is starting up. <p>

Due to an oversight some systems, such as OSF/1, which are based on
BSD 4.3 Reno or later, do not have the getkerninfo() system call
described below which allows GateD to read routes from the kernel
without know about kernel internal structures.  On these systems it is
necessary to read the kernel radix tree from the kernel by poking
around in kernel memory.  This is even more error prone than reading
the hash based forwding table.

<h3>Reading the forwarding table via getkerninfo/sysctl</h3>

Besides the routing socket, BSD 4.3 Reno introduced the
<em>getkerninfo</em> system call.  This call allows a user process (of
which GateD is one) to read various information from the kernel
without knowledge of the kernel data structures.  In the case of the
forwarding table, it is returned to gated atomically as a series of
routing socket messages.  This prevents the problem associated with
the forwarding table changing while GateD is in the process of reading
it. <p>

BSD 4.4 changed the getkerninfo interface into the <em>sysctl</em>
interface, which takes different parameters, but otherwise functions
identically.

<h3>Reading the forwarding table via OS specific methods</h3>

Some operating systems, for example SunOS 5, define their own
method of reading the kernel forwarding table.  The SunOS 5 version is
similar in concept to the getkerninfo method.

<h2>Reading the interface list</h2>

The kernel support subsystem of GateD is resposible for reading the
status of the kernel's physical and protocl interfaces periodically.
GateD detects changes in the interface list and notifies the protocols
so they can start or stop instances or peers.  The interface list is
read one of two ways:

<h3>Reading the interface list with SIOCGIFCONF</h3>

On systems based on BSD 4.3, 4.3 Reno and 4.3 Net/2 the
<code>SIOCGIFCONF</code> <em>ioctl</em> interface is used to read the
kernel interface list.  Using this method a list of interfaces and
some basic information about them is return by the SIOCGIFCONF call.
Other information must be learned by issuing other ioctls to learn the
interface network mask, flags, MTU, metric, destination address (for
point-to-point interfaces) and broadcast address (for broadcast
capable interfaces).
<p>

Gated reads re-reads this list every 15 second looking for changes.
When the routing socket is in use, it also re-reads it whenever a
messages is received indicating a change in routing configuration.
Receipt of a <code>SIGUSR2</code> signal also causes GateD to re-read
the list.  This interval may be explicitly configured in the <a
href="intfcs.html">interface configuration</a>.

<h3>Reading the interface list with sysctl</h3>

BSD 4.4 added the ability to read the kernel interface list via the
<em>sysctl</em> system call.  The interface status is returned
atomically as a list of routing socket messages which GateD parses for
the required information. <p>

BSD 4.4 also added routing socket messsages to report interface status
changes immediately.  This allows GateD to react quickly to changes in
interface configuration. <p>

When this method is in use, GateD re-reads the interface list only
once a minute.  It also re-reads it on routing table changes
indications and when a <code>SIGUSR2</code> is received.  This
interval may be explicitly configured in the <a
href="intfcs.html">interface configuration</a>.

<h2>Reading interface physical addresses</h2>

Later version of the <em>getkerninfo</em> and <em>sysctl</em>
interfaces return the interface physical addresses as part of the
interface information.  On most systems where this information is not
returned, GateD scans the kernel physical interface list for this
information for interfaces with IFF_BROADCAST set, assuming that their
drivers are handled the same as Ethernet drivers.  On some systems,
such as <em>SunOS 4</em> and <em>SunOS 5</em>, system specific
interfaces are used to learn this information<p>

The interface physical addresses are useful for IS-IS, for IP
protocols, they are not currently used, but may be in the future.

<h2>Reading kernel variables</h2>

At startup, GateD reads some special variables out of the kernel.
This is usually done with the <em>nlist</em> (or <em>kvm_nlist</em>)
system call, but some systems use different methods. <p>

The variables read include the status of <em>UDP checksum creation and
generation</em>, <em>IP forwarding</em> and <em>kernel version</em>
(for informational purposes).  On systems where the routing table is
read directly from kernel memory, the root of the <em>hash table</em>
or <em>radix tree</em> <em>routing table</em> is read.  On systems
where interface physical addresses are not supplied by other means,
the root of the <em>interface list</em> is read.

<h2>Special route flags</h2>

The later <em>BSD</em> based kernel support the special route flags
described here.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>RTF_REJECT</strong>
<dd> Instead of forwarding a packet like a normal route, routes with
     <code>RTF_REJECT</code> cause packets to be dropped and
     <code>unreachable</code> messages to be sent to the packet
     originators.  This flag is only valid on routes pointing at the
     <em>loopback</em> interface.
     
<dt> <strong>RTF_BLACKHOLE</strong>
<dd> Like the <code>RTF_REJECT</code> flag, routes with
     <code>RTF_BLACKHOLE</code> cause packets to be dropped, but
     <code>unreachable</code> messages are not sent.  This flag is
     only valid on routes pointing at the <em>loopback</em> interface.

<dt> <strong>RTF_STATIC</strong>
<dd> When GateD starts, it reads all the routes currently in the
     kernel forwarding table.  Besides interface routes, it usually
     marks everything else as a <em>remnant</em> from a previous run
     of GateD and deletes it after a few minutes.  This means that
     routes added with the <em>route</em> command will not be retained
     after GateD has started. <p>

     To fix this the <code>RTF_STATIC</code> flag was added.  When the
     <em>route</em> command is used to install a route that is not an
     inteface route it sets the <code>RTF_STATIC</code> flag.  This
     signals to GateD that said route was added by the systems
     administrator and should be retained.

<h2>Kernel Configuration</h2>

<PRE>
<strong>kernel</strong> <strong>{</strong>
    <strong>routes</strong> <var>number</var> <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>flash</strong>
        [ <strong>limit</strong> <var>number</var> ]
        [ <strong>type</strong> <strong>interface</strong> | <strong>interior</strong> | <strong>all</strong> ]
        <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>background</strong>
        [ <strong>limit</strong> <var>number</var> ]
        [ <strong>priority</strong> <strong>flash</strong> | <strong>higher</strong> | <strong>lower</strong> ]
        <strong>;</strong>
    <strong>traceoptions</strong> <var>trace_options</var> <strong>;</strong>
<strong>}</strong> <strong>;</strong>
</PRE>

<DL>
<dt> <strong>routes</strong> <var>number</var>
<dd> On some systems kernel memory is at a premium.  With this
     parameter a limit can be placed on the maximum number of routes
     GateD will install in the kernel.  Normally gated
     adds/changes/deletes routes in interface/internal/external order,
     i.e.  it queues interface routes first, followed by internal
     routes, followed by external routes, and processes the queue from
     the beginning.  If a this parameter is specified and the
     limit is hit, GateD does two scans of the list instead.  On the
     first scan it does deletes, and also deletes all changed routes,
     turning the queued changes into adds. It then rescans the list
     doing adds in interface/internal/external order until it hits the
     limit again.  This will tend to favor internal routes over
     external routes.  The default is not to limit the number of
     routes in the kernel forwarding table.
	
<dt> <strong>flash</strong>
<dd> When routes change, the process of notifying the protocols is
     called a <em>flash update</em>.  The kernel forwarding table
     interface is the first to be notified.  Normally a maximum of 20
     interface routes may be processed during one flash update.  The
     <code>flash</code> command allows tuning of these parameters.

     <dl>
     <dt> <strong>limit</strong> <var>number</var>
     <dd> Specifies the maximum number of routes which may be
          processed during one flash update.  The default is
          <code>20</code>.  A value of <code>-1</code> will cause all
          pending route changes of the specified type to be processed
          during the flash update.

     <dt> <strong>type</strong> <strong>interface</strong> | <strong>interior</strong> | <strong>all</strong>
     <dd> Specifies the type of routes that will be processed during a
          flash update. <CODE>Interior</CODE> specifies that interior
          routes (See the definition of <a
          href="proto_over.html#igp">interior gateway protocols</a>) will
          also be installed. <CODE>All</CODE> specifies the inclusion
          of exterior routes (See the definition of <a
          href="proto_over.html#egp">exterior gateway protocols</a>) as
          well.  The default is <code>interface</code> which
          specifies that only interface routes will be installed
          during a flash update.
     </dl>
     
     Specifying <code>flash limit -1 all</code> causes all routes to
     be installed during the <em>flash update</em>; this mimics the
     behavoir of previous versions of GateD.
     <p>
	
<dt> <strong>background</strong> 
<dd> Since only interface routes are normally installed during a flash
     update, the remaining routes are processed in batches in the
     background, that is, when no routing protocol traffic is being
     received.  Normally, 120 routes are installed at a time to allow
     other tasks to be performed and this background processing
     is done at lower priority than flash updates the following
     parameters allow tuning of these parameters:

     <dl>
     <dt> <strong>limit</strong> <var>number</var>
     <dd> Specifies the number of route which may be processed at
          during one batch.  The default is 120.

     <dt> <strong>priority</strong> <strong>flash</strong> | <strong>higher</strong> | <strong>lower</strong>
     <dd> Specifies the priority of the processing of batches of
          kernel updates in relationship to the <em>flash update</em>
          processing.  The default is <code>lower</code> which means
          that flash updates are processed first.  To process kernel
          updates at the same priority as flash updates, specify
          <code>flash</code>; to process them at a lower priority, use
          <code>lower</code>.
     </dl>
</dl>

<h2>Tracing optins</h2>

While the kernel interface isn't technically a routing protocol, in
many cases it is handled as one.  The following two symbols make sense
when entered from the command line since the code that uses them is
executed before the trace file is parsed.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>symbols</strong>
<dd> Symbols read from the kernel, by <code>nlist()</code> or similar
     interface. 
	
<dt> <strong>iflist</strong>
<dd> Interface list scan.  This option is useful when entered from the
     command line as the first interface list scan is performed before
     the configuration file is parsed.
</dl>
<P>

The following tracing options may only be specified in the
configuration file.  They are not valid from the command line.

<dl>
<dt> <strong>remnants</strong>
<dd> Routes read from the kernel when GateD starts.
	
<dt> <strong>request</strong>
<dd> Requests by GateD to Add/Delete/Change routes in the kernel forwarding table.
</dl>
<P>

The following general option and packet-tracing options only apply on
systems that use the routing socket to exchange routing information
with the kernel.  They do not apply on systems that use the old BSD4.3
ioctl() interface to the kernel.
          
<dl>
<dt> <strong>info</strong>
<dd> Informational messages received from the routing socket, such as
     TCP lossage, routing lookup failure, and route resolution
     requests.  GateD does not currently do processing on these
     messages, just logs the information if requested.
</dl>

                         
Packet tracing options (which may be modified with
<CODE>detail</CODE>, <CODE>send</CODE> and <CODE>recv</CODE>):
                    
<dl>
<dt> <strong>routes</strong>
<dd> Routes exchanged with the kernel, including Add/Delete/Change
     messages and Add/Delete/Change messages received from other
     processes. 

<dt> <strong>redirect</strong>
<dd> Redirect messages received from the kernel.
	
<dt> <strong>interface</strong>
<dd> Interface status messages received from the kernel.  These are
     only supported on systems with networking code derived from BSD
     4.4.
	
<dt> <strong>other</strong>
<dd> Other messages received from the kernel, including those
     mentioned in the <em>info</em> type above.
</dl>
