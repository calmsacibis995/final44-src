<H1>Options Statements</H1>
     
<P>Options statements allow specification of some global options.  If used, 
<CODE>options</CODE> must appear before any other type of configuration 
statement in the gated.conf file.

<P>The options statement syntax is:
     
<P><PRE>
    <strong>options</strong>
        [ <strong>nosend</strong> ]
        [ <strong>noresolv</strong> ]
	[ <strong>gendefault</strong> [ <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var> ] [ <strong>gateway</strong> <var>gateway</var>] ]
        [ <strong>syslog</strong> [ <strong>upto</strong> ] <var>log_level</var> ]
	[ <strong>mark</strong> <var>time</var> ]
        <strong>;</strong>
</PRE>

The options list can contain one or more of the following options:
     
<dl>
<dt> <a name="gendefault"><strong>gendefault</strong></a> [ <strong>preference</strong> <var><a href="pref.html">preference</a></var> ] [ <strong>gateway</strong> <var>gateway</var>]
<dd> When <code>gendefault</code> is enabled, when a BGP or EGP
neighbor is up it causes the creation of a default route with the
special protocol <code>default</code>.  This can be disabled per
BGP/EGP group with the <code>nogendefault</code> option.  By default,
this route has a preference of 20.  This route is normally not
installed in the kernel forwarding table, it is only present so it can
be announced to other protocols.  If a gateway is specified, the
default route will be installed in the kernel forwarding table with a
next hop of the listed gateway.
<p>

Note that the use of the more general option is prefered to the use of
this <code>gendefault</code> option.  The <code>gendefault</code>
option may go away in future releases.  The the section on <a
href="aggr_stmt.html">Route Aggregation</a> for more information on the
<code>generate</code> statement.
	
<dt> <strong>nosend</strong>
<dd> Do not send any packets.  This option makes it possible to run
     GateD on a live network to test protocol interactions without
     actually participating in the routing protocols.  The packet
     traces in the GateD log can be examined to verify that GateD is
     functioning properly.  This is most useful for RIP and HELLO and
     possibly the SMUX SNMP interface.  This option does not yet apply
     to BGP and is less than useful with EGP and OSPF.
	
<dt> <strong>noresolv</strong>
<dd> By default GateD will try to resolve symbolic names into IP
     addresses by using the gethostbyname() and getnetbyname() library
     calls.  These calls usually use the Domain Name System (DNS)
     instead of the hosts local host and network tables.  If there is
     insufficient routing information to send DNS queries, GateD will
     deadlock during startup.  This option can be used to prevent
     these calls, symbolic names will result in configuration file
     errors.
	
<dt> <strong>syslog</strong> [ <strong>upto</strong> ] <var>log_level</var>
<dd> Controls the amount of data GateD logs via syslog on systems
     where setlogmask() is supported.  The available logging levels
     and other terminology are as defined in the
     <CODE>setlogmask(3)</CODE> man page.  The default is equivalent
     to <CODE>syslog upto info</CODE>.

<dt> <strong>mark</strong> <var>time</var>
<dd> Specifying this option causes gated to output a message to the
     trace log at the specified interval.  This can be used as one
     method of determining if gated is still running.
