<h1>Protocol Overview</h1>

<P>Routing protocols determine the "best" route to each destination and 
distribute routing information among the systems on a network.  Routing 
protocols are divided into two general groups: interior and exterior 
protocols.  GateD software combines management of the interior and exterior 
routing protocols in one software daemon.
     
<A NAME="igp"><h2>Interior Routing Protocols</h2></A>

Interior protocols are used to exchange reachability information within an 
autonomous system (AS).  They are refered to as a class by the acronym
<strong>igp</strong>.  There are several interior protocols:
<P>

<dl>
<dt> <a NAME="RIP"><strong>RIP</strong></a>
<dd> The Routing Information Protocol, Version 1 and Version 2,
     is the most commonly used interior protocol.  RIP selects the
     route with the lowest metric as the best route.  The metric is a
     hop count representing the number of gateways through which data
     must pass to reach its destination.  The longest path that RIP
     accepts is 15 hops.  If the metric is greater than 15, a
     destination is considered unreachable and GateD discards the
     route.  RIP assumes the best route is the one that uses the
     fewest gateways i.e., the shortest path, not taking into account
     congestion or delay on route. <p>

     The RIP version 1  protocol is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1388">RFC 1388</a>
     and the RIP version 2 protocol is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1058">RFC 1058</a>.
     <p>
     
<dt> <a NAME="HELLO"><strong>HELLO</strong></a>
<dd> HELLO , another interior protocol, uses delay as the deciding
     factor in choosing the best route.  Round-trip time is the length
     of time it takes a datagram to travel from the source and
     destination.  HELLO is historically significant for the Internet
     as it was the protocol used among the original prototype NSFNET
     backbone <em>fuzzball</em> gateways.  Today, like fuzzballs,
     HELLO is a little-used protocol. <p>

     An earlier version of the HELLO protocol is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 891">RFC 891</a>.
     <p>

<dt> <a NAME="OSPF"><strong>OSPF</strong></a>
<dd> Open Shortest Path First is a link-state protocol.  OSPF is
     better suited than RIP for complex networks with many routers.
     OSPF provides equal cost multipath routing. <p>

     OSPF is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1247">RFC 1247</a>,
     the MIB is defined in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1253">RFC 1253</a>.
     Other related documents are
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1245">RFC 1245</a>,
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1246">RFC 1246</a>
     and
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1370">RFC 1370</a>.
     <p>

<dt> <a name="IS-IS"><strong>IS-IS</strong></a>
<dd> Intermediate System to Intermediate System (ISIS) is a link state
     interior gateway protocol (IGP) originally developed for routing
     ISO/CLNP (International Organization for
     Standardization/Connectionless Network Protocol) packets.  The
     version distributed with GateD can route IP packets as well.

<a NAME="egp"><H2>Exterior Routing Protocols</H2></a>
     
Exterior protocols are used to exchange routing information between 
autonomous systems.  Exterior protocols are only required when an 
autonomous system must exchange routing information with another autonomous 
system.  Routers within an autonomous system run an interior routing 
protocol like RIP.  Only those gateways that connect an autonomous system 
to another autonomous system need to run an exterior routing protocol.  
There are two exterior protocols currently supported by GateD:
     
<dl>
<dt> <a name="904"><strong>EGP</strong></a>
<dd> Exterior Gateway Protocol: Originally EGP reachability
     information was passed into ARPANET/MILNET "core" gateways where
     the best routes were chosen and passed back out to all connected
     autonomous systems.  As the Internet moved toward a less
     hierarchical architecture, EGP, an exterior routing protocol
     which assumes a hierarchical structure, became less effective. <p>

     The EGP protocol is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 827">RFC 827</a>
     and
     <a href="references.html#RFC 904">RFC 904</a>.
     <p>

<dt> <a name="BGP"><strong>BGP</strong></a>
<dd> Border Gateway Protocol is replacing EGP as the exterior protocol
     of choice. BGP exchanges reachability information between
     autonomous systems, but provides more capabilities than EGP.  BGP
     uses path attributes to provide more information about each route
     as an aid in selecting the best route. Path attributes may
     include, for example, administrative preferences based on
     political, organizational, or security (policy) considerations in
     the routing decision.  BGP supports nonhierarchical topologies
     and can be used to implement a network structure of equivalent
     autonomous systems. <p>

     BGP version 1 is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1105">RFC 1105</a>,
     version 2 in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1163">RFC 1163</a>,
     version 3 in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1267">RFC 1267</a>.
     The version 3 MIB is described in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1269">RFC 1269</a>.
     The two documents,
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1164">RFC 1164</a>
     and
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1268">RFC 1268</a>
     describe the application of version 2 and three in the internet.
     A protocol analysis of and experience with BGP version 3 are
     available in
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1265">RFC 1265</a>
     and
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1266">RFC 1266</a>.
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1397">RFC 1397</a>
     talks about advertising a <em>default</em> route in BGP version 2
     and 3.
     And finally,
     <a href="references.html#RFC 1403">RFC 1403</a>
     describes BGP - OSPF interaction.
