<h2>Abstract</h2>
Packet forwarding for OSI poses strong challenges for routing lookups:
the algorithm must be able to efficiently accommodate variable length,
and potentially very long addresses.
The 4.3 Reno release of Berkeley 
UNIX
uses a reduced radix tree
to make decisions about forwarding packets.
<p>

This data structure is general enough to encompass protocol to
link layer address translation
such as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP),
and the End System to Intermediate System Protocol (ES-IS),
and should apply to any hierarchical routing scheme,
such as source and quality-of-service routing,
or choosing between multiple Datakits on a single system.
<p>

The system
uses a message oriented mechanism to communicate between
the kernel and user processes to maintain the routing database,
inform user processes of spontaneous events such as redirects,
routing lookup failures, and suspected timeouts through gateways.
<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

An important focus of the 4.3 Reno release of Berkeley
UNIX
was to
make support for the OSI protocols publicly available.
OSI addresses are typically very long (20 bytes) and with the
explosive growth of the Internet, a router may have to contend
with thousands of them.
<p>

The traditional hash-based scheme of routing lookups
would perform poorly in this environment.
The older algorithm assumed that it would be cheap
to compute hashes, that one could easily identify
the network portion of an address, and easily compare them.
<p>

It is likely to be expensive to compute the hash 
of a 20 byte address.
Moreover,
where there are multiple hierarchies, it would be complicated
and context dependent to identify which portion of the address
should be considered as <em>the network portion</em> for comparison
at changing levels.
In general, it is not apparent how
to accommodate hierarchies while using hashing, other than rehashing
for each level of hierarchy possible.
<p>

Van Jacobsen, of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, suggested
using the PATRICIA algorithm (described below), but with
an additional invariant to maintain a routing tree.
This meshes extremely well with notions of multiple hierarchical
defaults, and the cost of an entire lookup is approximately the same as
the cost of computing a single hash.
<p>

Since there is now a means to store variable length addresses,
and reason to use addresses of differing sizes within a given
route (using a protocol destination address with a link-layer
gateway to accomplish ARP-like translation, for example),
it was decided that using fixed length ioctl's to communicate
between the kernel and routing process would be too restrictive.
Instead, a message based mechanism is used
for passing routing information to and from the kernel.
This mechanism provides additional potential for remote management
when future releases supply the ability to splice
communications channels.
<p>

<h2>Kernel Issues</h2>

<h3>Routing Lookups</h3>

<h4>Restatement of the Problem.</h4>

Let's describe the problem once again in a little more detail:
A packet arrives with a very long protocol address.
If the destination address is not that of the local system,
one wants to decide quickly how to forward it.
This decision entails choosing a network interface and a next-hop agent.
(Point-to-point links only have one agent on the other end of the link,
so sometimes it's enough just to figure out which link!).
<p>

Some of the routing protocols currently in use give us criteria for making
this choice, in what may seem a bizarre way:
the space of addresses is partitioned into a set of equivalence classes
by specifying a pair consisting of a prototype address and a bitmask;
a test address is deemed to belong to the class if any bit in which
it differs from the prototype address corresponds to a zero bit of
the provided mask.
<p>

Let's give an example, using the protocol addresses for the
Internet Family [Post],  which are 32-bit numbers:

<pre>
Example 1:  Some Address Classes

        Prototype        Mask        ClassName
        0x80030000       0xffff0000  LBL
        0x80200000       0xffff0000  Berkeley
        0x80208200       0xffffff00  CsDivSubnet
        0x80209600       0xffffff00  SpurSubnet
        0                0           TheOutside
</pre>

The author's machine (okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU) has the address 0x80208203.
Consequently, it belongs to the classes
Berkeley, CsDivSubnet, TheOutside,
but not LBL nor SpurSubnet.
With each class
is associated a networking interface, in most cases a next-hop agent,
and a collection of other useful information, and that collection
is referred to as a <em>route</em>.
Continuing the example, okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU can talk directly to any system
in the class CsDivSubnet (all such systems are on a single ethernet),
but requires an intermediary to talk to anybody else.
<p>

The routing lookup problem is to find the most specific class containing
a given protocol address.
Paradoxically, that will be the one with largest number of one bits
in the mask.
The NSF net may provide a regional router with about 2000 routes of this type.
The lookup algorithm must look up the appropriate class
quickly (among both numerous and lengthy addresses),
and yet have nice properties with respect to masks.

<h4>The algorithm</h4>

The collection of prototype addresses are assembled into a variant
of a PATRICIA tree, which is technically a binary radix tree with
one-way branching removed.
(In fact some writers call any tree with explicit external and
internal nodes a <em>trie</em>).
Although this algorithm is given a lengthy exposition in [Sedg]
and also is discussed in [Knut] and [Morr], we will review it here.
<p>

We build a tree with internal nodes and leaves.
The leaves will represent address classes, and will contain
information common to all possible destinations in each class.
As such, there will be at least a mask and prototype address.
Each internal node represents a bit position to test.
Given the
tree and a candidate address thought of as a sequence of bits, the
lookup algorithm is as follows:

<ol>
<li> Set node to the top of the tree.
<li> If at a leaf node, stop.
<li> Extract a bit position to test.
<li> If that bit of the candidate address is on, set the node to the
     right child of the current node, otherwise set node to the left
     child.
<li> Repeat steps 2 - 4.
</ol>
<p>

Once we arrive at a leaf node, we need to check whether we have selected
the appropriate class.
The class may consist of a single host.  This is a special case where the
mask consists of all one bits, but it is a common enough occurence
that we check for it (by use of a null pointer for the mask),
and do an outright string compare.
Otherwise, in which case we perform the masking operation.
<p>

It is possible to have the same prototype address with differing masks;
this is handled by a linked list of leaf nodes.
This arises due to boundary conditions for the smallest representation
of the default route (which collides with the boundary marker for the
empty tree).
It also arises if you want to route to subnet 0 of a subnetted class
A or B internet address.
<p>

If the leaf node isn't correct, then we backtrack up the tree
looking for indications that a more general mask may apply
(i.e. one having fewer one bits).
This may happen if we are asked to look up an address other than
the prototype addresses used to construct the tree.
Rather than keep a separate stack of nodes traversed while searching the
tree, backtracking is facilitated by having explicit parent pointers
in each node.
This also facilitates deletion, and allows non-recursive walks of the tree.

<strong>Figure 1.</strong>

</pre>

Figure 1. shows how one would construct a reduced radix tree
to decide among the prototype addresses given in the example
of address classes.
In examining the address for okeeffe.Berkeley.EDU (0x80208203), we find that
bit 0 is on (0x80000000: go right), bit 10 is on (0x00200000: go right),
bit 16 is on (0x00008000: go right), but that bit 19 is off
(0x00001000: go left).
And, in fact okeeffe does match the CsDivSubnet class.
<p>

If we were to look up another machine at Berkeley, say
miro.Berkeley.EDU (0x80209514), we are driven down to
the SpurSubnet class, which does not match.  So we backtrack
up to the second internal node above it, which has an indication
that there is a mask which may apply.
This is represented in the diagram by the dotted line,
which actually points to data associated with mask
contained in the leaf, rather than the leaf itself.
<p>

<!--
The internal node based on bit 10 does not have an indication
that there is a mask which may apply to it.
This because any search backtracking through there would
have had to had a 1 for bit 10 (since it otherwise would
have been trapped by the leaf for LBL itself), as
the LBL class has that bit off.  There is a measure of
how high in the tree a mask can apply (in our current scheme)
which we call the index of the mask.
The interested reader can peruse the source code in 4.3 Reno
for further elaboration.
>

Backtracking only occurs when given packets are covered by a
default route, or when non-prefix masks are employed.
The current implementation deals with non-contiguous masks
in a way requiring an explicit masking and re-lookup operation
for each possibly applicable mask encountered while backtracking.
This has the advantage that routes can be entered one by one
without requiring searches or reorganization of subtrees.
<p>

Researchers in the field ([Tsuc], [Butl]) have suggested this might
be avoided by constructing a tree in which the nodes test bits
in non-increasing order, governed by the masks found in leaves underneath.
This is the object of current study.

<h4>Comparison with the previous method.</h4>

Releases of Berkeley
UNIX
prior to 4.3 Reno employed an explicit three level hierarchy for routes,
routing first to hosts, then to networks, then to defaults.
The collections of host routes and network routes were entirely
seperate hash arrays.
<p>

Given a candidate address, an address family specific method would
be invoked to compute a hash value for the hosts array, and a bucket chosen.
Each element of the bucket would be compared against the candidate address,
via a second address family specific method for each comparison
(i.e. requiring a subroutine call per comparision).
<p>

If the candidate address was not found, the process would be repeated
with the network hash array.
If that failed, a list of defaults would be searched to see if there
were any for the address family of the candidate address.
<p>

By contrast,
the initial search of the tree also is written
in a protocol independent way.
Furthermore,
the new algorithm performs its comparisons in a
protocol independent way, permitting the back-tracking loop to
occur without separate subroutine calls.
<p>

It is interesting to note that in the average case,
PATRICIA trees are approximately balanced.  The expected length
of a search is only 1.44 log (number of entries); and of course
the maximum possible search is the number of bits in the address.
By contrast, the worst case for a degenerate hash is the number
of entries to be searched.  So, if we had 2000 IP entries, in the
PATRICIA case one would expect 15 bit tests, whereas in the typical
hashing situation of sqrt(N), on would expect about 44 hash entries
in 44 hash chains, with an average of 22 comparisons after hashing.
The (pathological) worst case is 32 bit tests versus 2000 compares.
<p>

<h3>The Routing Entry</h3>

The routing entry is a collection of information for use by protocol
implementations.
It has a base part which contains all the aspects common to a class
of hosts with which we might want to communicate that we can express
in a protocol-independent (or protocol-uniform) way.
It certainly includes the connectors used in constructing the tree,
the prototype address (which we think of as the destination address),
and the mask.
<p>

There are binary flags present which may greatly alter the interpretation
of the route, or even cause new ones to spring into existence.
(see <strong>Cloning Operation</strong>, below).
There are pointers to a protocol independent control structure
describing the network interface (the <em>ifnet</em> structure),
and the protocol level address which should be used in identifying
the local system (the <em>ifaddr</em> structure).
<p>

There is a possible gateway address,
that is used in situations in which protocol packets
must be sent to the intended recipients via an intermediary.
This mode of operation is identified by having a flag
<strong>RTF_GATEWAY</strong>.
In the other case (where no gateway is required), there
is a pointer to device- and protocol- specific information,
such as link-layer to protocol address translations,
or even other protocol control blocks for situations
such as running connectionless protocols over X.25.
<p>

The route includes a collection of statistics that are commonly maintained by
reliable and flow controlled protocols,
such as round-trip time, round-trip time variance, 
maximum packet size for this path, maximum number of gatewaying
or forwarding operations expected, in-bound and out-bound
throughput measures, and a bitmask to indicate if any of
these values should be left unaltered by protocol operation.
There are some other statistics that are purely housekeeping
matters, such as the number of protocol control blocks keeping
a reference to this route.
<p>

<h4>Cloning Operation</h4>

As mentioned above, it is sometimes convenient
for skeletal routing entries to be created and partially filled
in upon first reference (or lookup), with the missing information
to be supplied later.
Allocating a dedicated routing entry at initial connect time saves
the expensive of checking validity on each use.
<p>

An example of this would be a user opening a TCP connection to
another machine on the same ethernet, for which the link-layer
address was not yet known.
The creation of such entries would triggered by the flag
<strong>RTF_CLONING</strong> in a route being looked up.
<p>

For other sorts of link layer translations, such as IP address
to X.121 addresses for use over a public data network,
it may be desirable to have a message sent to a user level daemon
when the route is created, requesting
an external resolution of protocol addresses.
This mode is enabled by the flag <strong>RTF_XRESOLVE</strong>.
<p>

Another example would be a configuration in which there are many different
subnets on the other side of a serial link,
where each subnet may have different
performance characteristics (which could be learned operationally),
but that each use would be infrequent and random enough that
it would be wasteful
permanently to allocate space for routing entries to each possible subnet
in advance.
<p>

Here, a way to specify the netmask for the
newly cloned route is necessary, which needs to be more specific than
the netmask for the cloning route which creates it.
Thus, the route structure includes a pointer for this secondary mask,
which is only used in such a situation.
The primary netmask is used for <em>trapping</em> the lookup; the secondary
mask would be used as the primary mask in the newly created route
which would restrict additional lookups to that newly identified class of
hosts.
<p>

<h4>Black Holes (or Border Patrol)</h4>

A handy use for hierarchical defaults would be at the gateway
of a campus to catch packets for non-existent subnets or hosts
within the campus that would otherwise be sent to the default
route advertised by the regional connection to a backbone network.
This is easily implemented by the flag <strong>RTF_REJECT</strong>.
<p>

In 4.3 Reno,
the network output routines added an additional parameter,
a pointer to the route.
This parameter enabled cached link layer information to be retrieved,
but also allows
the loopback driver to recognize the <strong>RTF_REJECT</strong> flag.
When it does so, it consumes the offending packet and returns
EHOSTUNREACH or ENETUNREACH, prompting the protocols to do
the appropriate magic with no other changes.
<p>

<h3>Ancillary addressing structures:</h3>

<h4>The protocol independent network interface structure (ifnet)</h4>

For each network interface device, there is a structure
describing a number of protocol independent elements.
Some of these serve to identify the device:
a printable name and a unit identifier.
There are also general statistics kept about each device,
some inherent about the device itself (such as maximum
packet size,
a generic type for the device,
and binary flags indicating whether the device is point-to-point
or broadcast or deaf to its own broadcasts).
There are other statistics reflecting use, such as
number of packets in and outbound, (and how many of those encountered
errors), time of last use, total number of bytes transmitted and received.
There are a collection of methods associated with the device.
These include a general output routine to process packets
and place them on an output queue, an internal routine to 
initiate transmission, an ioctl routine, initialization, reset, and two
routines used at startup time.
<p>

This structure has escaped relatively unchagned from
previous versions of BSD;
a good description of it can be found in [Leff].
The new additions include the device start method which has makes it possible
for all ethernet drivers to use a common output routine, more statistics
required by SNMP [Case], and throughput statistics used for protocol
operation.
<p>

<h4>The protocol address structure (sockaddr)</h4>

All protocol addresses have a common two byte header
detailing the length and type of the address.
<p>

The 4.3 Reno release adds a device independent link-layer
address format, which may be used in sending link-layer packets
or disambiguating interfaces when more than one have the same
protocol addresses.

<h4>The protocol dependent interface addressing structure (ifaddr)</h4>

There may be multiple protocol addresses associated with each network
interface.
The <em>ifaddr</em> structure provides a place to store them and other
device- and protocol-specific information.
In fact, some protocols allow either multiple names for the same interface,
or the same name for multiple interfaces or both.
<p>

Even though the values will differ from protocol to protocol, there are some
other common elements that can be identified, so that
this structure has a protocol independent header, with a protocol
specific tail expected to follow immediately.
<p>

The protocol independent elements include
the address, associated subnet mask, destination or broadcast address,
linkage to the next address and the associated <em>ifnet</em>,
a method to be invoked when routes associated with this address
are created or deleted,
a routing entry associated with this address for this interface,
and generic flags for this level.
<p>

This structure is also discussed in [Leff].
The method, routing entry, and flags fields are new (since 4.3 BSD),
and the protocol addresses have been changed to pointers
rather than allocating fixed size spaces for them.
<p>

<h2>Messages and Formats</h2>

As mentioned above,
BSD has adopted a message passing approach for management of the
routing table, for a variety of reasons.
First, network address are of variable length,
and we may have varying numbers of them in differing operations.
Second, it provides a clean and uniform way of informing a routing process
of spontaneous events, such a redirects, routing misses,
requests to resolve link layer address translations,
or internal evidence that a gateway may have crashed,
(due to lack of acknowledgments across a class of connections).
Third, it provides a way for making additions or changes
to the management interface while maintaining backwards compatibility.
A version number is embedded in the message header, and 
each message is self delimiting, so that any unknown message to the
user program can be skipped.
Finally, for the future when it will be possible to splice message
streams together, it provides an easy path towards remote system
management.
<p>

<h3>The basic format</h3>

All messages have a common header, and some varying
number of protocol addresses appended to them.
The header includes the total length of the message,
a version number and a type, which allows non-understood messages
to be skipped.
There is space for a user-supplied sequence number.
The returned message includes the pid of the originating process.
<p>

The header also includes a number of metrics, a bit mask to
identify which are being specified, and a second bit mask
to specify which metrics must remained unchanged by the protocols.
<p>

The interpretation and number of the trailing protocol addresses
is specified by a bitmask.
The potential addresses are:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>RTA_DST</strong>
<dd> Prototype address

<dt> <strong>RTA_NETMASK</strong>
<dd> Bitmask for describing class

<dt> <strong>RTA_GATEWAY</strong>
<dd> Gateway

<dt> <strong>RTA_GENMASK</strong>
<dd> Bitmask for routes created by cloning

<dt> <strong>RTA_IFA</strong>
<dd> The protocol address to be used as a source address when sending
     to hosts covered by this route

<dt> <strong>RTA_IFP</strong>
<dd> An address unambiguously specifying which interface (struct
     <em>ifnet</em>) is associated with this route, such as a
     link-level address.

<dt> <strong>RTA_AUTHOR</strong>
<dd> Address identifying sender of redirect, etc.

</dl>

<h3>Message Types.</h3>

In this section, we'll discuss each of the message types,
describing features unique to each, and contrasting the
intent of otherwise similar looking messages.
<p>

<h4>RTM_ADD - Enter a new route into the table.</h4>

This is the basic operation for creating the routing table.
The destination and gateway addresses must be present.
If there is no netmask present, the route is assumed to be
a route to a host.
In the case where the host or class specified by the
route is directly reachable, the gateway address may be
used to specify a link layer address (for hosts), or the protocol
address of the outgoing interface, which may
implicity identify the
<em>ifaddr</em> and <em>ifnet</em> structure pointers.
Even the case of a class reached via a gateway,
one may be able to deduce the interface from the
address of the gateway.
If there is ambiguity about this, as may be the case in OSI
protocol operation, they must be explicitly supplied.
<p>

The flags may specify cloning operation, as described in section 2.2.1.
If the the new routes are to specify a subclass instead of
a host route, a generating bit mask needs to be supplied.
<p>

<h4>RTM_DELETE - Remove an entry from the table</h4>

If there is only one entry in the routing table with a given prototype
address, that is sufficient to identify the route to be deleted.
Otherwise,
the netmask associated with the route
must additionally be specified.

<h4>RTM_CHANGE - Alter characteristics of a route</h4>

Due to gateways going up or down, it may be desireable to change
the designated forwarding agent for a class of hosts.
It is also desirable to do so atomically (locking out
forwarding requests), so that there isn't a period in which
incorrect host or network unreachable protocol messages are generated
in response to packets to be forwarded.
Changing the gateway implicitly or explicitly requires changing
the associated <em>ifaddr</em> and <em>ifnet</em> structures.
<p>

In this message, one can also alter the metrics associated with a route
or some of the flags (cloning, resolving, link-layer-ness).
<p>

Altering the netmask associated with a route is not permitted,
since this would affect the geometry of the tree; instead one
deletes and re-inserts.
<p>

<h4>RTM_GET - Look up route and report characteristics.</h4>

This message is diagnostic in nature.
The user supplies a destination and the best match route
indication is returned, along with all of the metrics filled in.
Where there are multiple routes with the same
prototype address (but multiple netmasks), specifying the netmask
will allow the user to select the appropriate route.
<p>

<h4>RTM_REDIRECT - Request to change gateway.</h4>

This message is an example of a spontaneous event.
Both the TCP/IP and OSI family of protocols have the potential
for receiving an advisory report from a gateway that
the initiating system would be better off sending a packet
to another gateway on the same network for forwarding to a
remote location.
<p>

When the routing table is maintained by a user-level process,
it is important that the routing process be notified of any
changes to the routing table.
<p>

For OSI protocols, the initiating system may get a message
specifying the original destination, a bitmask specifying
a class of hosts for which this redirect also pertains,
the replacement gateway to be used, and the author
of the message.
<p>

<h4>RTM_LOSING - Trouble reports.</h4>

<em>Reliable</em> byte and message stream protocols such as TCP or OSI-TP keep
retransmission timers.
If a connection suddenly stops working, it may
signal the loss of a gateway.
User-level routing processes may be interested in keeping track of such
events, at the very least to determine if it appears the
local or a remote gateway as failed.
This message identifies the route which covers the remote
hosts involved in such lossage.
<p>

<h4>RTM_MISS - A routing table lookup failed.</h4>

The local system was asked to forward a packet or initiate
a connection to a destination for which it could not find a suitable route.
One could imagine a system attached to a wide area network
which would only allow a limited number of active reachable destinations,
such as an X.25 network.
The system might only enter those active peers in the network table,
and open new ones (or close old ones) based on the number of misses.
<p>

This may be useful for purely diagnostic purposes as well.
<p>

<h4>RTM_RESOLVE - Request to complete route info via CHANGE.</h4>

This is very similar to the RTM_MISS message.
It is intended for cloning operation (which would not otherwise
cause an RTM_MISS type  message) where some information needs to be obtained
externally from some process that is not convenient to be
coded directly into the kernel.
<p>
     
<h2>Measurements</h2>

We performed a synthetic test of constructing a routing table of
about 1600 entries using both the new and old methods (in a user-level
process).
We then searched each table randomly 100000 times for entries
in the table.
The routing table was constructed from data obtained on a gateway system
at Cornell University, which stands between the Cornell campus and the NSF net.

In fact, the time required to construct a table of 1600 routes was on the
order of half a second for either method; our test actually measured
constructing the table 10 times and emptying it 9 times.
The test results show the new (radix tree based) method to be about 50%
faster in constructing the tree and 200% faster in searching it.
The overhead column represents the time required to loop through
all routes calling a routine that does nothing instead of adding,
deleting or lookup a route.
The units in the table below are user time in seconds,
as measured on a CCI tahoe processor running 4.3 Reno BSD.

the tree is taken verbatim.
