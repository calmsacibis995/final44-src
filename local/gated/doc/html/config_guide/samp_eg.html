<H1>Sample Exterior Gateway Configurations</H1>

<P><STRONG>We need more examples.</STRONG>  If you don't see what 
you need here, and you create a <EM>working</EM> config file that 
you're willing to share, <EM>please</EM> send it to us.  (Also, if 
you find mistakes in the examples here, well, ahem, just tell us 
quietly and we'll fix them.)

<H3>RIP/EGP Configuration</H3>

This configuration enables both an interior (RIP) and an exterior (EGP) 
protocol and sets certain protocol specific parameters.
     

<PRE>
    #  generate a default route if an EGP  neighbor is acquired
    #
    options gendefault ;
    #
    # define the autonomous system number for EGP
    #
    autonomoussystem 303 ;
    #
    # enable RIP
    #
    rip yes ;
    #
    # enable EGP with hello interval 1 1/2 minute, poll
    #  interval 10 minutes, neighbors 26.6.0.103 and 26.20.0.72
    #
    egp yes
    { packetsize 24488 ;
      group minhello 1:30 minpoll 10:00
      {
           neighbor 26.6.0.103 ;
           neighbor 26.20.0.72 ;
      } ;
    } ;
    #
    # announce 136. 66 to AS 183
    #
    export proto egp as 183 {
           proto direct {
                announce 136.66.0.0 metric 0 ;
           } ;
      } ;
    #
    # announce default via RIP with a metric of 3
    #
    export proto rip interface 136.66.12.1 {
           proto default {
                announce 0.0.0.0 metric 3 ;
           } ;
    } ;
</PRE>
                 
<P>The AS number 303 is defined early as it is a definition statement and 
must occur before the first protocol statement.  EGP is enabled by the 
<CODE>yes</CODE> in the EGP statement, which defines additional EGP 
parameters e.g.  the <CODE>packetsize</CODE> parameter defining the initial 
size of update packets accepted, the <CODE>group</CODE> clause which sets 
parameters for all of the EGP neighbors in the group, and 
<CODE>minhello</CODE> and <CODE>minpoll</CODE> used to set the protocol 
timers.  The first <CODE>export</CODE> statement directs GateD to use EGP 
to advertise the network (136.66.0.0) to the Internet.  This is the address 
of the network, not of a gateway.  The second <CODE>export</CODE> statement 
is used to announce the default route to subnet 136.66.12.0 with a metric 
of 3.

     In   this   sample   configuration,  GateD  implements   the
     transformation  of  distance metrics  between  the  internal
     (OSPF)  and  external  (BGP) protocols.   Autonomous  system
     1019, of which GateD is a member, contains network 19.0.0.0.
     The   GateD   machine  has  several  interfaces  into   this
     autonomous system.  GateD is using BGP to peer with AS 2021,
     neighbor 21.5.1.21.

<P>In this configuration two autonomous systems (one internal, one 
external) are directly connected through a router that is attached to a 
backbone speaking OSPF.  The AS number 1019 is defined early as it is a 
definition statement that occurs again in the first protocol statement 
which enables BGP.  The first <CODE>export</CODE> statement directs GateD 
to advertise routes from the internal group AS 1019 running OSPF as the IGP 
gathering routing information to the external group AS 2021 using BGP.  
Routes to two local ethernets in AS 1019, identified as 119.2.128.18 and 
119.4.128.18 (119.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0), are advertised along with the OSPF 
backbone (19.1.1.19.) The parameters for AS path, path origin and 
transitive optional attributes including transmission intervals are 
defined.  The second <CODE>export</CODE> statement announces the default 
route to AS 2021 with a metric of 1.
