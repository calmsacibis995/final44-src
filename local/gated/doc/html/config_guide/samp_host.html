<H2>Sample Host Configurations</H2>
          
<P>End system configuration is simple, usually containing only two 
configuration statements.  The configuration shown here emulates 
<CODE>routed</CODE>.  It runs RIP, and it only sends updates if there 
is more than one interface up and IP forwarding is enabled in the 
kernel.
          
<P><PRE>
    #
    rip yes ;
    #
</PRE>

<P>Note: RIP will not run if UDP checksums are disabled in the 
kernel.
          
<P>This configuration runs RIP in quiet mode; it only listens to packets, 
no matter how many interfaces are configured.
          

<P><PRE>
    #
    rip yes ;
    {
        nobroadcast ;
    } ;
    #
</PRE>

<P>This configuration should work for any system that runs RIP and has only 
one network interface.
          

<P><PRE>
    #
    # don't time-out the network interface
    #
    interface 136.66.12.2 passive ;
    #
    # enable rip
    #
    rip yes ;
    #
</PRE>

<P>(SWB: Is this correct now? JC)

<P>The keyword passive prevents GateD from changing the preference of the 
route to this interface if it is believed to be down due to lack of 
received routing information.  The purpose of the interface passive 
statement is to identify a router with a guest host on an Ethernet.  In 
this example the route is through the directly attached network interface.  
Normally when GateD thinks an interface is down, it removes it from the 
routing database to prevent a gateway from announcing that it can route 
data through a non-operational interface.  If the host has only one 
interface, it should not be removed from the routing database even if the 
interface is down i.e.  the statement interface 136.66.12.2 passive in this 
configuration.  RIP is enabled with a rip yes statement.  This statement is 
not required as it is the default but the explicit statement in the 
gated.conf file serves to document the configuration preventing future 
confusion.
