<H1>Sample Interior Gateway Configurations</H1>

<P><STRONG>We need more examples.</STRONG>  If you don't see what 
you need here, and you create a <EM>working</EM> config file that 
you're willing to share, <EM>please</EM> send it to us.  (Also, if 
you find mistakes in the examples here, well, ahem, just tell us 
quietly and we'll fix them.)

<A NAME="RIPonly"><H3>RIP only, subnet to backbone</H3></A>

Gateway configurations are more complicated than a simple host 
configuration as gateways have multiple interfaces and may run 
multiple protocols.  This sample configuration file connects two nets 
within an autonomous system.  This configuration can be used for any 
gateway that uses only RIP and that connects a single subnet to a 
larger network.

<P><PRE>
    #
    # enable rip
    #
    rip yes ;
    #
    #  using  rip,  announce subnet 3 via  interface 136.66.1.2
    #
    export proto rip interface 136.66.1.2
    {
        proto direct
        {
            announce 136.66.3.0 metric 0 ;
        } ;
    } ;
    #
    #  using  rip, announce all routes learned from interface 136.66.1.2
    #
    export proto rip interface 136.66.3.1
    {
        proto rip interface 136.66.1.2
        {
            announce all ;
        } ;
    } ;
</PRE>
               
<P>The configuration contains two export statements.  The first one tells 
GateD to announce, via the RIP protocol and interface 136.66.1.2 a direct 
route to subnet 136.66.3.0.  The second route announces to subnet 3 all 
routes learned from the interface 136.66.12.  This includes subnet routes 
and any routes to the rest of the world, including default routes.  The 
first export statement was not required since by default GateD announces 
every network that is directly connected to the gateway.  The first export 
statement was explicitly entered for two reasons; to document the intended 
structure and to avoid relying on defaults which may be changed in future 
releases.  In any export statement the main proto clause and the main 
interface clause may define the protocol and interface through which the 
routes are advertised.  Subsidiary proto and interface clauses define the 
protocols and the interfaces from which the routes must be learned.
          
<A NAME="RIPdefault"></A>
<H3>RIP with default announcement</H3>

If the gateway only runs RIP and connects a local backbone to a subnet 
which in turn provides a gateway to the outside world, the file is 
configured differently.  In this example, the gateway announces a default 
route to the backbone and announces all of the individual subnet routes to 
the outside world.

    #
    # enable rip
    #
    rip yes ;
    #
    #  using  rip, announce all local subnets via 136.66.12.3
    #
    export proto rip interface 136.66.12.3 metric 3
    {
        proto rip interface 136.66.1.5
        {
            announce all ;
        } ;
    };
    #
    #  using  rip,  announce default  to  the  local backbone via 136.66.1.5
    #
    export proto rip interface 136.66.3.1
    {
        proto rip interface 136.66.12.3
        {
            announce 0.0.0.0 ;
        } ;
    } ;
</PRE>
                 
<P>The first export statement statement explictly directs GateD to 
announce all of the routes it learns from interface 136.66.1.5 out through 
interface 136.66.12.3.  The explicit announce all is not required.  The 
metric value is specified in the main statement and applies to every route 
announced via this protocol and interface.  When the metric is specified in 
the export clause it only applies to the routes specified in that clause.  
In this example metric 3 applies to every route announced over interface 
136.66.12.3 via RIP.

<A NAME="RIPOSPF"></A>
<H3>RIP and OSPF</H3>
     
This configuration for AS 283 enables both RIP and OSPF protocols and can 
be used for testing RIP and OSPF.

                 priority 2 ;
            } ;
            interface le {
                 authkey "YYYYYYYY" ;

    } ;
    static {

    }
</PRE>
                 
<P>In the RIP case version 2 multicast packets are generated on all 
ethernet interfaces (le0, le1...).  This is a safe way to test RIP since 
the production gateways on this network do not support RIP version 2.  In 
the OSPF case, all interfaces are configured to be Priority 2 so the 
Proteon routers (Priority 0) will become designated routers.  A simple 
password is specified "YYYYYYYY" for authentication of all Ethernet 
interfaces.  (The only kind of interfaces in this configuration.)


<A NAME="OSPFNBMA"></A>
<H3>OSPF Using NBMA Mode</H3>

In this sample configuration, an HP server is configured to be both the 
area border router and the backbone router.
