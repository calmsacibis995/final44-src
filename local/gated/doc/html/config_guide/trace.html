<H1>Trace Statements</H1>

<P>Trace statements control tracing options.  GateD's tracing options may be 
configured at many levels.  Tracing options include the file 
specifications, control options, and global and protocol specific tracing 
options.  Unless overridden, tracing options from the next higher level are 
inherited by lower levels.  For example, BGP peer tracing options are 
inherited from BGP group tracing options, which are inherited from global 
BGP tracing options, which are inherited from global GateD tracing 
options.  At each level tracing specifications override the inherited 
options.

<h2>Global tracing options</h2>

<P>There are two types of global options, those which only affect global 
operations and those which have potential significance to protocols.

<h3>Global significance only</h3>

The trace flags that only have global significance are:
 
<dl>
<dt> <strong>parse</strong> 
<dd> Trace the lexical analyzer and parser.  Mostly used by GateD
     developers for debugging.
        
<dt> <strong>adv</strong> 
<dd> Trace the allocation of and freeing of policy blocks.  Mostly
     used by the GateD developers for debugging.
        
<dt> <strong>symbols</strong> 
<dd> Used to trace symbols read from the kernel at startup.  The only
     useful way to specify this level of tracing is via the
     <code>-t</code> option on the command line since the symbols are
     read from the kernel before parsing the configuration file.
        
<dt> <strong>iflist</strong> 
<dd> Used to trace the reading of the kernel interface list.  It is
     useful to specify this with the <code>-t</code> option on the
     command line since the first interface scan is done before
     reading the configuration file.
</dl>

<h3>Protocol significance</h3>
 
The options flags that have potential significance to protocols are:
     
<dl>
<dt> <strong>all</strong> 
<dd> Turn on all of the following.
   
<dt> <strong>general</strong> 
<dd> A shorthand notation for specifying both <code>normal</code> and
     <code>route</code>. 
               
<dt> <strong>state</strong> 
<dd> Trace state machine transitions in the protocols.
   
<dt> <strong>normal</strong> 
<dd> Trace normal protocols occurrences.  Abnormal protocol
     occurrences are always traced.
   
<dt> <strong>policy</strong> 
<dd> Trace application of protocol and user-specified policy to routes
     being imported and exported. 
   
<dt> <strong>task</strong> 
<dd> Trace system interface and processing associated with this
     protocol or peer.
   
<dt> <strong>timer</strong> 
<dd> Trace timer usage by this protocol or peer.
   
<dt> <strong>route</strong> 
<dd> Trace routing table changes for routes installed by this protocol
     or peer.
</dl>

Not all of the above options apply to all of the protocols.  In some
cases their use does not make sense (for instance, RIP does not have a
state machine) and in some instances the requested tracing has not
been implemented (such as RIP support of the <code>policy</code>
option). <p>
     
<img src="../note.gif" alt="NOTE!">
It is not currently possible to specify packet tracing from the
command line.  This is because a global option for packet tracing
would potentially create too much output. <P>

When protocols inherit their tracing options from the
global tracing options, tracing levels that
don't make sense (such as <code>parse</code>, <code>adv</code> and
packet tracing options) are masked out.  <p> 

Global tracing statements have an immediate effect, especially parsing
options that effect the parsing of the configuration file.  Tracing
values inherited by protocols specified in the configuration file are
initially inherited from the global options in effect as they are
parsed, unless they are overridden by more specific options.  After
the configuration file is read, tracing options that were not
explicitly specified are inherited from the global options in effect
at the end of the configuration file.

<h2>Packet tracing</h2>

Tracing of packets is very flexible.  For any given protocol there are
one or more options for tracing packets.  all protocols allow use of
the <strong>packets</strong> keyword allows for tracing <em>all</em>
packets sent and received by the protocol.  most protocols have other
options for limiting tracing to a useful subset of packet types.
These tracing options can be further controlled with the following
modifiers:
     
<dl>
<dt> <strong>detail</strong> 
<dd> <code>detail</code> must be specified before <code>send</code> or
     <code>recv</code>.  Normally packets are traced in a
     terse form of one or two lines.  When <code>detail</code>
     is specified, a more verbose format is used
     to provide further detail on the contents of
     the packet.
        
<dt> <strong>send</strong>
<dt> <strong>recv</strong>
<dd> These options limit the tracing to packets
     sent or received.  Without these options both sent and received
     packets will be traced.
</dl>
     
<p><img src="../note.gif" alt="NOTE!">
<code>Detail</CODE>, if specified, must be before <CODE>send</CODE> or
<CODE>recv</CODE>.  If a protocol allows for several different types
of packet tracing, modifiers may be applied to each individual type.
But be aware that within one tracing specification the trace flags are
summed up, so specifying <code>detail packets</code> will turn on full
tracing for all packets.

<h2>Traceoptions syntax</h2>

<pre>
    <strong>traceoptions</strong> ["<var>trace_file</var>" [<strong>replace</strong>] [<strong>size</strong> <var>size</var>[<strong>k</strong>|<strong>m</strong>] <strong>files</strong> <var>files</var>]]
	[<var>control_options</var>] <var>trace_options</var> [<strong>except</strong> <var>trace_options</var>] ;
                    
    <strong>traceoptions</strong> <strong>none</strong> ;
</pre>

<dl>
<dt> <var>trace_file</var>
<dd> Specifies the file to receive tracing information.  If this file
     name does not begin with a slash <strong>(/)</strong> the directory
     where gated was started in prepended to the name.

<dt> <strong>replace</strong>
<dd> Tracing should start by replacing an existing file.  The default
     is to append to an existing file.

<dt> <strong>size</strong> <VAR>size</VAR>[<strong>k</strong>|<strong>m</strong>] <strong>files</strong> <VAR>files</VAR>
<dd> Limit the maximum size of the trace file to the specified size
     (mimimum 10k).  When the trace file reaches the specified size, it is
     renamed to <code>file.0</code>, then <code>file.1</code>,
     <code>file.2</code> up to the maximum number of files (minimum
     specification is 2).

<dt> <var>control_options</var>
<dd> Specifies options that control the appearance of tracing. Valid
values are:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>nostamp</strong>
<dd> Specifies that a timestamp should not be prepended to all trace
     lines.
</dl>

<dt> <strong>except</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Used to enable a broad class of tracing and then disable more
     specific options.

<dt> <strong>none</strong>
<dd> Specifies that all tracing should be turned off for this protocol
or peer.

</dl>
