<h1><img src="../logo.gif" alt="">INSTALLATION of GateD %(VERSION)</h1>

The GateD makefile system is setup to allow object directories for
multiple architectures to use one source tree.  The object directories
consist of a few configured files and symlinks for the majority of the
GateD files.  They are named obj.&lt;arch&gt; where arch is the architecture
of your system as reported by the arch or machine program.  If one of
these programs can not be found, the first part of your hostname is
used, see src/util/archtype for more information. 

<ol>
<li> Create an object directory,
     <code>src/obj.`src/util/archtype`</code>.  Run
     <code>src/util/archtype</code> directly to display the
     architecture.  If you will never compile GateD on a second
     architecture you can use <code>obj</code>.  For example, on a <em>Sun
     SPARCstation</em> running <em>SunOS 4.1.1</em>:

<pre>
<em>sun%</em> <strong>src/util/archtype</strong>
<em>SunOS-4.1.1-sun4</em>
<em>sun%</em> <strong>mkdir src/obj.`src/util/archtype`</strong>
<em>sun%</em> <strong>ls -d src/obj.*</strong>
<em>src/obj.SunOS-4.1.1-sun4/</em>
</pre>

     On <em>BSD 4.3 Reno</em> and later obj directories are supported
     in the format the system sources use.  This support is not
     direct, but a hack.  On these systems you will need to specify
     the full path to some directories, for an example see
     <code>src/configs/vangogh</code>. <p>

<li> Build a config file.  This file is used as input to a
     configuration script which builds a Makefile and system specific
     header files.  <p>

     A description of config file options is available in
     <code>src/configs/README</code>. <p>

     Examples of quite a few config files are in
     <code>src/configs</code>, pick the one that is closest to what
     you want and tailor it to your specific configuration.  Install
     this config file in the previously created object directory with
     the name <code>Config</code>. <p>

<li> Configure GateD for this architecture by typing <code>make
     config</code>.  This will run an awk script on your
     <code>obj.`src/util/archtype`/Config</code> file which builds a
     sed script.  This sed script is used to edit a Makefile template.
     The Makefile is then run to configure architecture specific
     files, create symbolic links, and dependencies. <p>

<li> Build GateD by typing <code>make</code> in the src directory or
     the object directory. <p>

<li> Become root and install GateD <code>make install</code> in the
     src or object directory.  Then optionally type <code>make
     install-man</code> in the same directory to install the man
     pages. <p>
	   
<li> Make up a configuration file.  Sample config files are in the
     conf directory and the man page explains all config options.
     Install the config file in <code>/etc/gated.conf</code>. <p>

<li> Take cover and .... <strong>FIRE IT UP!</strong>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<dl>
<dt> <strong>UDP Checksums</strong>
<dd> RIP will refuse to run if it determines that UDP checksums are
     disabled in the kernel.  Running without UDP checksums can lead
     to incorrect routing information being propagated, especially on
     serial links.  This check does not help you determine if RIP
     packets you receive are missing a checksum, but at least it
     prevents you from generating these packets and calls attention to
     the problem. <p>

     There are two ways to enable UDP checksums.  Your operating
     system may provide enough source to enable checksums by default.
     <em>SunOS</em> provides this in
     <code>/sys/netinet/in_proto.c</code>. Update the source and
     recompile the kernel. <p>

     If your operating system does not provide the relevent source,
     you can patch the running kernel and disk image with a sequence
     similar to this (as root): 

<pre>
<em>sun#</em> <strong>adb -k -w /vmunix /dev/mstrong</strong>
<strong>_udp_cksum/W 1</strong>
<em>_udp_cksum:     0x0             =       0x1</em>
<strong>_udp_cksum?W 1</strong>
<em>_udp_cksum:     0x0             =       0x1</em>
<strong>^D</strong>
<em>sun# </em>
</pre>

     You can probably find the proper name for the UDP checksum value with:

<pre>  
<em>sun#</em> <strong>nm -o /vmunix | grep udp_c</strong>
<em>/vmunix:f80fa35c D _udp_cksum</em>
<em>/vmunix:f801bd10 T _udp_ctlinput</em>
<em>sun#</em>
</pre>
	
<dt> <strong>IP Multicast support</strong>
<dd> The OSPF and RIP implementations (and in the future hopefully
     Router Discovery) make use of IP multicasting facilities.  If
     these facilities are not present, functionality is reduced.  <p>

     Some systems ship with IP multicasting support, namely <em>BSDI's
     BSD/386 1.0</em>, <em>Sun's Solaris 2.0</em> and <em>Silicon
     Graphics' IRIX</em>.  For other systems, IP multicasting support
     may be available (for example <em>SunOS 4.1.*</em> and some
     versions of <em>Ultrix</em>), check the FTP directories on <a
     href="ftp://gregorio.stanford.edu/vmtp-ip">
     gregorio.stanford.edu</a>, <a
     href="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com">parcftp.xerox.com</a> and <a
     href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mbone">ftp.isi.edu</a>. <p> 

     RIP-II and OSPF specify the use of IP multicast on P2P
     interfaces.  Due to bugs in most implementations of the IP
     multicast code GateD will not be able to specify it's use on
     these interfaces.  GateD will automatically fall back to using
     the destination address of the P2P link.  In the OSPF case, no
     functionality will be lost, but in the RIP-II case you will loose
     the ability to pass arbitrary subnet masks via these interfaces. <p>
     
     Another bug in IP multicast support causes multicast packets to
     local-wire groups to fail if there is not a default route for IP,
     multicast, or the specific group.  As a workaround, GateD
     installs a default route for any local-wire multicast group it
     uses via the loopback interface.  This default is not actually
     used, but it avoids a kernel bug sending to these groups. <p>

<dt> <strong>Interfacing to the ISODE SMUX interface</strong>
<dd> This version of GateD can do SNMP via the <em>ISODE 7.0</em> SMUX
     interface.  If you don't already have <em>ISODE 7.0</em> you may
     obtain a version with many SMUX/SNMP patches applied via <a
     href="ftp://gated.cornell.edu/pub/gated/isode-snmp-7.0.tar.Z">FTP
     from gated.cornell.edu as pub/gated/isode-snmp-7.0.tar.Z.</a> <p>

     Even though the <em>ISODE</em> source requires alot of disk
     space, it isn't necessary to build and install all of
     <em>ISODE</em>, just the core distribution and the snmp code.  A
     partial install (<code>inst-partial</code> and
     <code>inst-snmp</code>) are the minimum required. <p>

     GateD also supports the <em>ISODE 6.8</em> based SMUX interface
     on <em>AIX 3</em> systems.  If you experience errors of the form:

</samp></pre>
	
     The mosy supplied with <em>ISODE 6.8</em> could not parse this
     syntax, even though it is correct. <p>

<dt> <strong>Running GateD on SunOS 4.0 systems</strong>
<dd> If GateD gets sendto() network unreachable problems when running
     on SunOS 4.0 systems, add <code>`hostname`</code> to the
     <code>ifconfig</code> commands for <code>ie0/le0/ec0</code> in
     <code>/etc/rc.local</code>.  Otherwise <em>SunOS</em> has a
     misconception of the route to the attached network. <p>

     In an attempt to make binaries that read kernel memory compatible
     between different kernel architectures, Sun has created libkvm.a.
     Unfortunately, the dynamically loaded versions of these libraries
     are broken on <em>SunOS 4.*</em> systems, so GateD must be
     statically linked.  This prevents the use of a GateD binary
     compiled on one kernel architecuture (say <em>sun4m</em>) from
     working on another (<em>sun4c</em>). <p>

<dt> <strong>Running GateD on AIX 3.2 systems</strong>
<dd> <em>AIX 3.2</em> has networking code based on <em>BSD 4.3
     Reno</em>, including variable length subnet masks and the routing
     socket.  Some of the extensions are available when the system is
     <em>not</em> running in <em>BSD 4.3</em> compatibility mode (see
     the <code>compat_43</code> variable and <code>no</code>).  Amoung
     these are the ability to determine the destination address of a
     RIP packet (used when GateD is responding to the ripquery
     program).  GateD can run in either mode with a slight loss of
     functionality in <em>BSD 4.3</em> compatability mode.  Make sure
     you compile with <code>-D_BSD=44</code>! <p>

     In order to generate a core dump useful for debugging on <em>AIX
     3</em>, the default limit on the core size must be increased.
     This can be accomplished via the shell, or automatically when
     GateD is started via gdc.  Some compilation-time configuring is
     necessary for this to work.  Either define
     <code>GDC_CORESIZE=RLIM_INFINITY</code> in the
     <code>obj/Config</code> file, or define <code>GDC_RESOURCE</code>
     and use the <code>-c</code> option to <code>gdc</code> at run
     time. <p>

<dt> <strong>Compiling GateD on systems with shared libraries</strong>
<dd> If an assertion failure occurs in <code>task_stdio_read()</code>,
     it is because a file descriptor was improperly closed.  This can
     occur when the named resolver libraries are improperly installed
     in the system shared libraries.  If the socket used by the shared
     libraries is not statically initialized to -1, file descriptor
     zero will be closed when GateD calls <code>endhostent()</code>.
     The solution is to fix the shared libraries.  A workaround would
     be to not use any symbolic names in the config file <em>and</em>
     specify <code>options noresolv ;</code>. <p>

<dt> <strong>Using GateD on AIX 3.1 and 3.2</strong>
<dd> Problems have been reported with <code>yacc</code> on at least
     some versions of <em>AIX 3.1</em> and <em>3.2</em>.  On of the
     problems is that <code>yacc</code> does not report parse errors
     to the caller, resulting in GateD trying to run with an incorrect
     configuration.  It is strongly recommended that you obtain
     <em>GNU</em> <code>bison</code> instead.  It is available for <a
     href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">anonymous FTP from
     prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu directory</a>. <p>

<dt> <strong>Running HELLO and/or EGP on 4.2 based systems</strong>
<dd> If you would like to run HELLO or EGP on a 4.2 based system such
     as <em>Ultrix 1.2, 2.0, 2.1</em> and <em>SunOS 3.x</em> you will
     need to add the following code to the following modules and
     rebuild your kernel.

<pre><samp>          
<strong>/sys/netinet/in.h</strong>:

#define IPPROTO_EGP		8		/* exterior gateway protocol */

#define IPPROTO_HELLO		63		/* Fuzzball HELLO protocol */

<strong>/sys/netinet/in_proto.c</strong> for <em>SunOS 3.x</em>:

{ SOCK_RAW,	PF_INET,	IPPROTO_HELLO,	PR_ATOMIC|PR_ADDR,
  rip_input,	rip_output,	0,	0,
  raw_usrreq,
  0,		0,		0,		0,
},
{ SOCK_RAW,	PF_INET,	IPPROTO_EGP,	PR_ATOMIC|PR_ADDR,
  rip_input,	rip_output,	0,	0,
  raw_usrreq,
  0,		0,		0,		0,
},

<strong>/sys/netinet/in_proto.c</strong> for <em>Ultrix 1.2, 2.0 and 2.2</em>:

{ SOCK_RAW,     &inetdomain,    IPPROTO_HELLO,    PR_ATOMIC|PR_ADDR,
  rip_input,    rip_output,     0,              0,
  raw_usrreq,
  0,            0,              0,              0,
  0,            0,              0,
},
{ SOCK_RAW,     &inetdomain,    IPPROTO_EGP,    PR_ATOMIC|PR_ADDR,
  rip_input,    rip_output,     0,              0,
  raw_usrreq,
  0,            0,              0,              0,
  0,            0,              0,
},
