<h1><img src="logo.gif" alt="">GateD %(VERSION) Documentation</h1>

The <strong>GateD</strong> documentation is now all written in
<code>HTML</code>, the <code>HyperText Markup Language</code>.  It has
been developed primarily with the <em>NCSA Mosaic for the X Window
System</em> <code>WWW/HTML</code> viewer, but should work with any
<code>WWW/HTML</code> viewer.  Mosaic viewers for the X Window System,
the Apple Macintosh and for Microsoft Windows are available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic">ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in the Mosaic
directory</a>. <p>

If you are reading this file as the <code>README</code> file in a
GateD distribution, it was converted to plain text for the
distribution.  The <code>INSTALL</code> file in this directory has
also been converted from <code>HTML</code> to plain text.  To view the
GateD documentation with an HTML viewer, point it at
<code>doc/main.html</code>. <p>

<h2><a name="What is GateD?">What is GateD?</a></h2>

GateD is a modular software program consisting of core services, a
routing database, and protocol modules supporting multiple routing
protocols (RIP versions 1 and 2, DCN HELLO, OSPF version 2, EGP
version 2 and BGP version 2 through 4.) GateD was first used to
interconnect the NSFNET and the emerging regional networks, and to
implement filtered routing based on policy.  GateD allows the network
administrator to control import and export of routing information by
individual protocol, by source and destination autonomous system,
source and destination interface, previous hop router, and specific
destination address.  The network administrator can specify a
preference level for each combination of routing information being
imported by using a flexible masking capability.  Once the preference
levels are assigned, GateD makes a decision on which route to use
independent of the protocols involved. <p>

GateD is designed to handle dynamic routing with a routing database
built from information exchanged by routing protocols. <p>

<h2><a name="Getting HELP!">Getting HELP!</a></h2>

If you need assistance or have any questions, don't bang your head
against the wall.  Post to the mailing list.  There are many people
with GateD experience who may be able to take a moment to help. <p>

When reporting a problem with GateD, several pieces of information
will greatly assist in debugging:

<ol>
<li> GateD version (%(VERSION)).

<li> What system it is running on, hardware, software and versions. 

<li> Your configuration file.

<li> The interface configuration.  It helps to provide this as both
     the output of <code>netstat -in</code> (<code>netstat -i
     -n</code> on <em>BSD 4.2</em> based systems) and an
     <code>ifconfig</code> for each interface (<code>ifconfig
     -a</code> will work for some versions of <em>SunOS 4</em> and
     later.

<li> The routing table, i.e. <code>netstat -rn</code> (<code>netstat
     -r -n</code> on <em>BSD 4.2</em> based systems)

<li> GateD's idea of the above.  To get this start GateD with
     <code>-t</code> (which is short for <code>-tgeneral</code>).
     Setting tracing options in the config file will not get all this
     information because GateD scans the interfaces before parsing the
     config file. So you must specify tracing on the command line.

<li> Trace output of your problem.  If it is a RIP problem, turn on
     RIP tracing, an EGP problem, turn on EGP tracing.
