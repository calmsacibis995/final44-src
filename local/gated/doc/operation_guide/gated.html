<h2>NAME</h2>
<strong>gated</strong> - gateway routing daemon
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<strong>gated</strong>
[ <strong>-c</strong> ]
[ <strong>-C</strong> ]
[ <strong>-n</strong> ]
[ <strong>-N</strong> ]
[ <strong>-t</strong> <var>trace_options</var> ]
[ <strong>-f</strong> <var>config_file</var> ]
[ <var>trace_file</var> ]
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<strong>GateD</strong> is a routing daemon that handles multiple
routing protocols and replaces <cite>routed (8)</cite> and <cite>egpup
(8)</cite>.

<strong>GateD</strong> currently handles the RIP, BGP, EGP, HELLO, and
OSPF routing protocols.  The <strong>gated</strong> process can be
configured to perform all routing protocols or any subset of them.

<p>The command-line options are:

<dl compact>
<dt> <strong>-c</strong>
<dd> Specifies that the configuration file will be parsed for syntax
     errors and then <strong>gated</strong> will exit, if there were
     no errors, <strong>gated</strong> will leave a dump file in
     <em>/usr/tmp/gated_dump</em>. <strong>Gated</strong> does not need to
     be run as the super user to use the <strong>-c</strong> option but it may not be
     possible to read the kernel forwarding table and interface
     configuration if not run as super user.  The <strong>-c</strong> option implies
     <code>-tgeneral</code>.  All <code>traceoption</code> clauses
     in the configuration file will be ignored.

<dt> <strong>-C</strong>
<dd> Specifies that the configuration file will just be parsed for syntax
     errors. <strong>gated</strong> will exit with a status 1 if there
     were any errors and 0 if there were not. <strong>Gated</strong>
     does not need to be run as the super user to use the <strong>-C</strong> option
     but it may not be possible to read the kernel forwarding table and
     interface configuration if not run as super user.

<dt> <strong>-n</strong>
<dd> Specifies that <strong>gated</strong> will not modify the kernel
     forwarding table.  This is used for testing <strong>gated</strong>
     configurations with actual routing data. 

<dt> <strong>-N</strong>
<dd> Specifies that <strong>gated</strong> will not daemonize.
     Normally, if tracing to stderr is not specified
     <strong>gated</strong> will daemonize if the parent process ID is
     not 1.  This allows the use of an <em>/etc/inittab</em>-like method of
     invoking <strong>gated</strong> that does not have a PID of 1.

<dt> <strong>-t</strong> <var>trace_options</var>
<dd> Specifies a comma separated list of trace options to be enabled
     on startup. If no flags are specified, <em>general</em> is
     assumed.  No space is allowed between this option and it's
     arguments. 
     <p>
     This option must be used to trace events that take place
     before the config file is parsed, such as determining the
     interface configuration and reading routes from the kernel.
     <p>
     See the <cite><a href="../config_guide/config.html">GateD Configuration
     Guide</a></cite> for valid trace options and a more detailed
     explaination of tracing.

<dt> <strong>-f</strong> <var>config_file</var>
<dd> Use an alternate config file. By default, <strong>gated</strong>
     uses <em>/etc/gated.conf</em>.
     <p>
     If a trace file is specified on the command line, or no
     trace flags are specified on the command line,
     <strong>gated</strong> detaches from the terminal and runs in the
     background.  If trace flags are specified without specifying a
     trace file, <strong>gated</strong> assumes that tracing is
     desired to stderr and remains in the foreground.
</dl>

<h2>SIGNAL PROCESSING</h2>
The following signals may be used to control <strong>gated</strong>:

<dl>     
<dt> <strong>SIGHUP</strong>
<dd> Re-read configuration.
     <p>
     A SIGHUP causes <strong>gated</strong> to reread the
     configuration file. <strong>Gated</strong> first performs a
     clean-up of all allocated policy structures.  All BGP and EGP
     peers are flagged for deletion and the configuration file is
     re-parsed.
     <p>
     If the re-parse is successful, any BGP and EGP peers that are
     no longer in the configuration are shut down, and new peers are
     started. <strong>Gated</strong> attempts to determine if changes
     to existing peers require a shutdown and restart.  OSPF is not
     capable of reconfiguring, it is shutdown and restarted during a
     reconfiguration.  This may have an adverse impact on the routing
     system.
     <p>
     It should also be possible to enable/disable any protocol
     without restarting <strong>gated</strong>.

<dt> <strong>SIGINT</strong>
<dd> Snap-shot of current state.
     <p>
     The current state of all <strong>gated</strong> tasks,
     timers, protocols and tables are written to
     <em>/usr/tmp/gated_dump</em>.
     <p>
     On systems supporting <code>fork()</code>, this is done by forking a
     subprocess to dump the table information so as not to impact
     <strong>gated</strong>'s routing functions.  On systems where
     memory management does not support copy-on-write, <code>fork()</code> will cause
     the <strong>gated</strong> address space to be duplicated; this
     may be cause a noticeable impact on the system.  On system not
     supporting <code>fork()</code>, the main process immediately processes the
     dump, which may impact <strong>gated</strong>'s routing
     functions.

<dt> <strong>SIGTERM</strong>
<dd> Graceful shutdown.
     <p>
     On receipt of a <strong>SIGTERM</strong>, <strong>gated</strong> attempts a
     graceful shutdown.  All tasks and protocols are asked to
     shutdown.  Most will terminate immediately, the exception being
     EGP peers which wait for confirmation. It may be necessary to
     repeat the <strong>SIGTERM</strong> once or twice if it this process takes too
     long.
     <p>
     All protocol routes are removed from the kernel forwarding
     table on receipt of a <strong>SIGTERM</strong>. Interface routes, routes with
     <code>RTF_STATIC</code> set (from the route command where supported) and
     static routes specifying <code>retain</code> will remain.  To terminate
     <strong>gated</strong> with the exterior routes intact, use
     <strong>SIGKILL</strong>.

<dt> <strong>SIGUSR1</strong>
<dd> Toggle tracing.
     <p>
     On receipt of a <strong>SIGUSR1</strong>, <strong>gated</strong>
     will close
     the trace file.  A subsequent SIGUSR1 will cause it to be
     reopened.  This will allow the file to be moved regularly.
     <p>
     It is not possible to use <strong>SIGUSR1</strong> if a trace file has not
     been specified, or tracing is being performed to stderr.
     
<dt> <strong>SIGUSR2</strong>
<dd> Check for interface changes.
     <p>
     On receipt of a <strong>SIGUSR2</strong>, <strong>gated</strong>
     will rescan the kernel interface list looking for changes.

</dl>

<h2>FILES</h2>

Many of default filenames listed below contain the string %s, which is
replaced by the name with which gated is invoked.  Normally this is
<em>gated</em>, but if invoked as <em>gated-test</em>,
<em>gated</em> will by default look for
<code>/etc/gated-test.conf</code>.  These paths may all be changed at
compilation time.

<dl>
<dt> /usr/tmp/gated_dump
<dd> Where <strong>gated</strong> writes status information.  The
     default is <code>/usr/tmp/%s_dump</code>.  Another common path is
     <code>/var/tmp/%s_dump</code>.

<dt> /etc/gated.conf
<dd> Where <strong>gated</strong> looks for it's configuration file.
     The default is <code>/etc/%s.conf</code>.

<dt> /etc/gated.pid
<dd> Where <strong>gated</strong> writes it's process id (PID).  The
     defalt is <code>/etc/%s.pid</code>, but
     <code>/var/run/%s.pid</code> is common.
