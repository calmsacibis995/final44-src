<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<strong>Gdc</strong> provides a user-oriented interface for the operation of the
<cite>gated (8)</cite>
routing daemon.  It provides support for starting and
stopping the daemon, for the delivery of signals to manipulate the
daemon when it is operating, for the maintenance and syntax checking
of configuration files, and for the production and removal of state dumps
and core dumps.
<strong>Gdc</strong>
can reliably determine 
<em>gated</em>'s
running state and produces a reliable
exit status when errors occur, making it advantageous for use in
shell scripts which manipulate
<em>gated</em>.
Commands executed using
<strong>gdc</strong>
and, optionally, error messages produced by the execution of those
commands, are logged via the same
<cite>syslogd (8)</cite>
facility which
<em>gated</em>
itself uses, providing an audit trail of operations performed on
the daemon.
<p>
If installed as a setuid root program
<strong>gdc</strong>
will allow non-root users who are members of a trusted group (by
default the
<strong>gdmaint</strong>
group) to manipulate the routing daemon while denying access
to others.  The name of the user is logged along via
<cite>syslogd (8)</cite>
along with an indication of each command executed, for audit purposes.
<p>
The command-line options are:
<dl compact>
<dt> <strong>-n</strong>
<dd> Run without changing the kernel forwarding table.  Useful for
     testing, and when operating as a route server which does no
     forwarding.

<dt> <strong>-q</strong>
<dd> Run quietly.  With this option informational messages which are
     normally printed to the standard output are suppressed and error
     messages are logged via <cite>syslogd (8)</cite> instead of being
     printed to the standard error output.  This is often convenient
     when running <strong>gdc</strong> from a shell script.

<dt> <strong>-t</strong> <var>seconds</var>
<dd> Specifies the time in seconds which <strong>gdc</strong> will
     spend waiting for <em>gated</em> to complete certain operations,
     in particular at termination and startup.  By default this value
     is set to 10 seconds. 
</dl>

These additional command-line options may be present, depending on the
options used to compile <strong>gdc</strong>:

<dl compact>
<dt> <strong>-c</strong> <var>coresize</var>
<dd> Sets the maximum size of a core dump a <em>gated</em> started
     with <strong>gdc</strong> will produce.  Useful on systems where
     the default maximum core dump size is too small for
     <em>gated</em> to produce a full core dump on errors.

<dt> <strong>-f</strong> <var>filesize</var>
<dd> Sets the maximum file size a <em>gated</em> started with
     <strong>gdc</strong> will produce.  Useful on systems where the
     default maximum file dump size is too small for <em>gated</em> to
     produce a full state dump when requested.

<dt> <strong>-m</strong> <var>datasize</var>
<dd> Sets the maximum size of the data segment of a <em>gated</em>
     started with <strong>gdc</strong>. Useful on systems where the
     default data segment size is too small for <em>gated</em> to run.
     
<dt> <strong>-s</strong> <var>stacksize</var>
<dd> Sets the maximum size of stack of a <em>gated</em> started with
     <strong>gdc</strong>. Useful on systems where the default maximum
     stack size is too small for <em>gated</em> to run.
</dl>

The following commands cause signals to be delivered to <em>gated</em>
for various purpose:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>COREDUMP</strong>
<dd> Sends an abort signal to <em>gated</em>, causing it to terminate with a core dump.

<dt> <strong>dump</strong>
<dd> Signal <em>gated</em> to dump its current state into the file
     <em>/usr/tmp/gated_dump</em>.

<dt> <strong>interface</strong>
<dd> Signal <em>gated</em> to recheck the interface configuration.
     <em>gated</em> normally does this periodically in any event, but
     the facility can be used to force the daemon to check interface
     status immediately when changes are known to have occured.

<dt> <strong>KILL</strong>
<dd> Cause <em>gated</em> to terminate ungracefully.  Normally useful
     when the daemon has hung.

<dt> <strong>reconfig</strong>
<dd> Signal <em>gated</em> to reread its configuration file,
     reconfiguring its current state as appropriate.

<dt> <strong>term</strong>
<dd> Signal <em>gated</em> to terminate after shutting down all
     operating routing protocols gracefully. Executing this command a
     second time should cause <em>gated</em> to terminate even if some
     protocols have not yet fully shut down.

<dt> <strong>toggletrace</strong>
<dd> If <em>gated</em> is currently tracing to a file, cause tracing
     to be suspended and the trace file to be closed.  If
     <em>gated</em> tracing is current suspended, cause the trace file
     to be reopenned and tracing initiated.  This is useful for moving
     trace files.
</dl>

By default <em>gated</em> obtains its configuration from a file
normally named <em>/etc/gated.config</em>.
The <em>gdc</em> program also maintains several other versions of the
configuration file, in particular named:

<dl>
<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em>
<dd> The <em>new</em> configuration file.  When <strong>gdc</strong>
     is requested to install a new configuration file, this file is
     renamed <em>/etc/gated.conf</em>.

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf-</em>
<dd> The <em>old</em> configuration file.  When <strong>gdc</strong>
     is requested to install a new configuration file, the previous
     <em>/etc/gated.conf</em> is renamed to this name.

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf--</em>
<dd> The <em>really old</em> configuration file. <strong>Gdc</strong>
     retains the previous <em>old</em> configuration file under this
     name.
</dl>

The following commands perform operations related to configuration files:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>checkconf</strong>
<dd> Check <em>/etc/gated.conf</em> for syntax errors.  This is
     usefully done after changes to the configuration file but before
     sending a <strong>reconfig</strong> signal to the currently
     running <em>gated</em>, to ensure that there are no errors in the
     configuration which would cause the running <em>gated</em> to
     terminate on reconfiguration.  When this command is used,
     <strong>gdc</strong> issues an informational message indicating
     whether there were parse errors or not, and if so saves the error
     output in a file for inspection.

<dt> <strong>checknew</strong>
<dd> Like <strong>checkconf</strong> except that the <em>new</em>
     configuration file, <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em>, is checked
     instead.

<dt> <strong>newconf</strong>
<dd> Move the <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em> file into place as
     <em>/etc/gated.conf</em>, retaining the older versions of the
     file as described above. <strong>Gdc</strong> will decline to do
     anything when given this command if the <em>new</em>
     configuration file doesn't exist or otherwise looks suspect.

<dt> <strong>backout</strong>
<dd> Rotate the configuration files in the <em>newer</em> direction,
     in effect moving the <em>old</em> configuration file to
     <em>/etc/gated.conf</em>. The command will decline to perform the
     operation if <em>/etc/gated.conf-</em> doesn't exist or is zero
     length, or if the operation would delete an existing, non-zero
     length <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em> file.

<dt> <strong>BACKOUT</strong>
<dd> Perform a <strong>backout</strong> operation even if
     <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em> exists and is of non-zero length.

<dt> <strong>modeconf</strong>
<dd> Set all configuration files to mode 664, owner root, group
     gdmaint.  This allows a trusted non-root user to modify the
     configuration files.

<dt> <strong>createconf</strong>
<dd> If <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em> does not exist, create a zero length
     file with the file mode set to 664, owner root, group gdmaint.
     This allows a trusted non-root user to install a new
     configuration file.
</dl>

The following commands provide support for starting and stopping
<em>gated</em>, and for determining its running state:

<dl>
<dt> <strong>running</strong>
<dd> Determine if <em>gated</em> is currently running.  This is done
     by checking to see if <em>gated</em> has a lock on the file
     containing its pid, if the pid in the file is sensible and if
     there is a running process with that pid.  Exits with zero status
     if <em>gated</em> is running, non-zero otherwise.

<dt> <strong>start</strong>
<dd> Start <em>gated</em>. The command returns an error if
     <em>gated</em> is already running.  Otherwise it executes the
     <em>gated</em> binary and waits for up to the delay interval (10
     seconds by default, as set with the <strong>-t</strong> option
     otherwise) until the newly started process obtains a lock on the
     pid file.  A non-zero exit status is returned if an error is
     detected while executing the binary, or if a lock is not obtained
     on the pid file within the specified wait time.

<dt> <strong>stop</strong>
<dd> Stop <em>gated</em>, gracefully if possible, ungracefully if not.
     The command returns an error (with non-zero exit status) if
     <em>gated</em> is not currently running.  Otherwise it sends a
     terminate signal to <em>gated</em> and waits for up to the delay
     interval (10 seconds by default, as specified with the
     <strong>-t</strong> option otherwise) for the process to exit.
     Should <em>gated</em> fail to exit within the delay interval it
     is then signaled again with a second terminate signal.  Should it
     fail to exit by the end of the second delay interval it is
     signalled for a third time with a kill signal.  This should force
     immediate termination unless something is very broken.  The
     command terminates with zero exit status when it detects that
     <em>gated</em> has terminated, non-zero otherwise.

<dt> <strong>restart</strong>
<dd> If <em>gated</em> is running it is terminated via the same
     procedure as is used for the <strong>stop</strong> command above.
     When the previous <em>gated</em> terminates, or if it was not
     running prior to command execution, a new <em>gated</em> process is
     executed using the procedures described for the
     <strong>start</strong> command above.  A non-zero exit status is
     returned if any step in this procedure appears to have failed.
</dl>

The following commands allow the removal of files created by the
execution of some of the commands above: 

<dl>
<dt> <strong>rmcore</strong>
<dd> Removes any existing <em>gated</em> core dump file.

<dt> <strong>rmdump</strong>
<dd> Removes any existing <em>gated</em> state dump file.

<dt> <strong>rmparse</strong>
<dd> Removes the parse error file generated when a
     <strong>checkconf</strong> or <strong>checknew</strong> command
     is executed and syntax errors are encountered in the
     configuration file being checked.
</dl>

<h2>FILES</h2>

Many of default filenames listed below contain the string %s, which is
replaced by the name with which gated is invoked.  Normally this is
<em>gated</em>, but if invoked as <em>gated-test</em>,
<strong>gated</strong> will by default look for
<code>/etc/gated-test.conf</code>.  These paths may all be changed at
compilation time.

<dl>
<dt> <em>/etc/gated</em>
<dd> the <em>gated</em> binary.  Another popular location is
     <code>/usr/local/sbin/gated</code>.

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf</em>
<dd> current <em>gated</em> configuration file.

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf+</em>
<dd> newer configuration file.

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf-</em>
<dd> older configuration file

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.conf--</em>
<dd> much older configuration file

<dt> <em>/etc/gated.pid</em>
<dd> where <em>gated</em> stores its pid, the default is
     <code>/etc/%s.pid</code>.  Another popular location is
     <code>/var/run/%s.pid</code>. 

<dt> <em>/usr/tmp/gated_dump</em>
<dd> <em>gated</em>'s state dump file, the default is
     <code>/usr/tmp/%s_dump</code>.  Another popular location is
     <code>/var/tmp/%s_dump</code>.

<dt> <em>/usr/tmp/gated_parse</em>
<dd> where config file parse errors go, the default is
     <code>/usr/tmp/%s_parse</code>.  Another popular location is
     <code>/var/tmp/%s_parse</code>. 

<dt> <em>/usr/tmp</em>
<dd> where <em>gated</em> drops its core file.  Another popular
     location is <code>/var/tmp</code>.  The core file is usually
     <code>core</code>, but some systems use <code>core.gated</code>.

<h2>BUGS</h2>

Many commands only work when <em>gated</em> is installed in the system
directory it was configured with.

<p>There is not yet any way to tell <strong>gdc</strong> about
systems which name their core dump other than <em>core</em>
(<em>core.gated</em> is a less common possibility).
