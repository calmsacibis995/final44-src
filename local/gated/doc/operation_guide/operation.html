<h2>Starting GateD at boot time</h2>

GateD is usually started from <code>/etc/rc.local</code> at system
startup (boot) time.  GateD is preferably started after the partition
it resides in is mounted and after <cite>syslog (8)</cite> has been
started.  It is acceptable to start GateD <strong>before</strong> the
interfaces have been enabled with <cite>ifconfig (8)</cite>, but it
may be started later if desired.  GateD must be started before
starting any programs that require routing information, for example
NFS mounts from systems on different neworks or <cite>xntpd
(8)</cite>.

<h3>Starting GateD directly</h3>

Usually a few lines like the following is added to
<code>/etc/rc.local</code> to start GateD:

<pre><code>
if [ -f /etc/gated.conf -a -f /usr/local/sbin/gated ]; then
	/usr/local/sbin/gated ;	echo -n "gated "
fi
</code></pre>

<h3>Starting GateD with Gdc</h3>

Starting GateD with Gdc is required when some system resources are
inadequate to run gated.  Again, a few lines need to be added to
<code>/etc/rc.local</code>:

<pre><code>
if [ -f /etc/gated.conf -a -f /usr/local/bin/gdc ]; then
    /usr/local/bin/gdc [ <var>flags</var> ] start ; echo -n "gated(via gdc) " ;
fi
</code></pre>

Where <var>flags</var> are any Gdc options.

<h2>Controlling GateD</h2>

GateD is normally controlled via the <code>gdc</code> utility, but may
be controlled directly.  See the <a href="gdc.html"><cite>Gdc Manual
Page</cite></a> and <a href="gated.html"><cite>GateD Manual
Page</cite></a> for more information.

<h2>Checking GateD status</h2>

Using <code>gdc</code> it is possible to obtain a status dump from
GateD.  It is also possible to query GateD for information about the
RIP and OSPF protocols with the <code>ripquery</code> and
<code>ospf_monitor</code> utilities.  See the <a
href="ripquery.html"><cite>Ripquery Manual Page</cite></a> and <a
href="ospf_monitor.html"><cite>Ospf_monitor Manual Page</cite></a> for
more information.
