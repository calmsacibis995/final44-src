<h1>OSPF_MONITOR 8 "$Date: 1994/06/10 02:46:11 $" "%#(RELEASE)" "Cornell GatedDaemon Project"</h1>
<h2>NAME</h2>
<strong>ospf_monitor</strong> - monitor OSPF gateways
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<strong>ospf_monitor</strong> <em>mon_db_file</em>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Use the <strong>ospf_monitor</strong> command to query OSPF routers.
The <strong>ospf_monitor</strong> command operates in interactive mode.
It allows the
user to query the various OSPF routers to provide detailed information
on IO statistics, error logs, link-state data bases, AS external data
bases,
the OSPF routing table, configured OSPF interfaces, and OSPF neighbors.
<p>
<em>Mon_db_file</em>
is the complete pathname of a database composed of 
records configuring destinations for 
<strong>ospf_monitor</strong>
remote commands.
Each destination record is a single-line entry which lists the
destination
IP address, the destination hostname, and an OSPF authentication key (if
authentication is activated by the destination).
Since authentication
keys
may be present in the destination records, it is recommended that
general
access to this database be restricted.
<p>
Refer to RFC-1583 (OSPF Specification, version 2) for details about OSPF
database and packet formats.
<h2>COMMANDS</h2>
Upon entering interactive mode, 
<strong>ospf_monitor</strong>
presents the
<code>'[ # ] dest command params >'</code> prompt, at which you can enter any
of 
<strong>ospf_monitor</strong>'s
interactive commands.
Interactive commands can
be
interrupted at any time via a keyboard interrupt.
Note that the command
line length must be less than 200 characters.
<h3>Local Commands</h3>

<dt> <strong>x</strong>
<dd> Exit the <strong>ospf_monitor</strong> program.
     
<dt> <strong>@</strong> <em>remote_command</em>
<dd> Send <em>remote_command</em> to the same (previous) destination.

<dt> <strong>@</strong><em>dest_index</em> <em>remote_command</em>
<dd> Send <em>remote_command</em> to configured destination
     <em>dest_index</em>.

<dt> <strong>F</strong> <em>filename</em>
<dd> Send all <strong>ospf_monitor</strong> output to
     <em>filename</em>.
     
<dt> <strong>S</strong>
<dd> Send all <strong>ospf_monitor</strong> output to stdout.
</dl>

<h3>Remote Commands</h3>

<dl>
<dt> <strong>a</strong> <em>area_id</em> <em>type</em> <em>ls_id</em> <em>adv_rtr</em>
<dd> Display link state advertisement. <em>Area_id</em> is the OSPF
     area for which the query is directed. <em>adv_rtr</em> is
     the router-id of the router which originated this link state
     advertisement. <em>Type</em> specifies the type of
     advertisement to request and should be specified as follows:

     <dl compact>
     <dt> 1
     <dd> Request the router links advertisements. They describe the
          collected states of the router's interfaces. For this type
          of request, the <em>ls_id</em> field should be set to the
          originating router's Router ID.

     <dt> 2
     <dd> Request the network links advertisements. They describe the
          set of routers attached to the network. For this type of
          request, the <em>ls_id</em> field should be set to the IP
          interface address of the network's Designated Router.

     <dt> 3
     <dd> Request the summary link advertisements describing routes to
          networks. They describe inter-area routes, and enable the
          condensing of routing information at area borders. For
          this type of request, the <em>ls_id</em> field should be set
          to the destination network's IP address.

     <dt> 4
     <dd> Request the summary link advertisements describing routes to
          AS boundary routers. They describe inter-area routes, and
          enable the condensing of routing information at area
          borders. For this type of request, the <em>ls_id</em> field
          should be set to the Router ID of the described AS boundary
          router.

     <dt> 5
     <dd> Request the AS external link advertisements. They describe
          routes to destinations external to the Autonomous
          System. For this type of request, the <em>ls_id</em> field
          should be set to the destination network's IP address.
     </dl>

<dt> <strong>c</strong>
<dd> Display cumulative log. This log includes input/output statistics
     for monitor request, hello, data base description, link-state
     request, link-state update, and link-state ack packets. Area
     statistics are provided which describe the total number of
     routing neighbors and number of active OSPF interfaces. Routing
     table statistics are summarized and reported as the number of
     intra-area routes, inter-area routes, and AS external data base
     entries.

<dt> <strong>e</strong>
<dd> Display cumulative errors. This log reports the various error
     conditions which can occur between OSPF routing neighbors and
     shows the number of occurrences for each.

<dt> <strong>h</strong>
<dd> Displays the next hop list.  This is a list of valid next hops
     mostly derived from the SPF calculation.

<dt> <strong>l</strong> <em>retrans</em>
<dd> Display the link-state database (except for ASE's). This table
     describes the routers and networks making up the AS. If
     <em>retrans</em> is non-zero, the retransmit list of neighbors
     held by this lsdb structure will be printed.

<dt> <strong>A</strong> <em>retrans</em>
<dd> Display the AS external data base entries. This table reports the
     advertising router, forwarding address, age, length, sequence
     number, type, and metric for each AS external route. If
     <em>retrans</em> is non-zero, the retransmit list of neighbors
     held by this lsdb structure will be printed.

<dt> <strong>o</strong>
<dd> Display the OSPF routing table. This table reports the AS border
     routes, area border routes, summary AS border routes, and
     networks currently managed via OSPF.

<dt> <strong>I</strong>
<dd> Display all interfaces. This report shows all interfaces
     configured for OSPF. Information reported includes the area,
     interface IP address, interface type, interface state, cost,
     priority, and the IP address of the DR and BDR for the network.

<dt> <strong>N</strong>
<dd> Display all OSPF routing neighbors. Information reported includes
     the area, local interface address, router ID, neighbor IP
     address, state, and mode.
