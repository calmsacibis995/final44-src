<h1>RIPQUERY 8 "$Date: 1994/03/16 21:39:09 $ UTC" "%#(RELEASE)" "Cornell GateDaemon Project"</h1>
<h2>NAME</h2>
<strong>ripquery</strong> - query RIP gateways
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<strong>ripquery</strong>
[ <strong>-1</strong> ]
[ <strong>-2</strong> ]
[ <strong>-a</strong> <var>authkey</var> ]
[ <strong>-n</strong> ]
[ <strong>-p</strong> ]
[ <strong>-r</strong> ]
[ <strong>-v</strong> ]
[ <strong>-w</strong> <var>time</var> ]
<var>gateway ...</var>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<strong>Ripquery</strong>
is used to request all routes known by a RIP gateway by sending a RIP
request or POLL command.  The routing information in any routing packets
returned is displayed numerically and symbolically.
<strong>Ripquery</strong>
is intended to be used as a tool for debugging gateways, not for network
management.  SNMP is the preferred protocol for network management.
<p>
<strong>Ripquery</strong>
by default uses the RIP POLL command, which is an undocumented extension
to the RIP specification supported by
<em>routed</em>
on <em>SunOS 3.x</em> and later and by
<em>gated</em>
1.4 and later.
The RIP POLL command is preferred over the RIP REQUEST
command because it is not subject to Split Horizon and/or Poisoned
Reverse.  See the RIP RFC for more information.
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl compact>
<dt> <strong>-1</strong>
<dd> Send the query as a version 1 packet.

<dt> <strong>-2</strong>
<dd> Send the query as a version 2 packet (default).

<dt> <strong>-a</strong> <var>authkey</var>
<dd> Specifies the authentication password to use for queries.  If
     specified, an authentication type of SIMPLE will be used,
     otherwise the default is an authentication type of NONE.
     Authentication fields in incoming packets will be displayed, but
     not validated.
     
<dt> <strong>-n</strong>
<dd> Prevents the address of the responding host from being looked up
     to determine the symbolic name.

<dt> <strong>-p</strong>
<dd> Uses the RIP POLL command to request information from the routing
     table. This is the default, but is an undocumented extension
     supported only by some versions of <em>SunOS 3.x</em> and later versions
     of <em>gated</em>. If there is no response to the RIP POLL
     command, the RIP REQUEST command is tried. <em>Gated</em>
     responds to a POLL command with all the routes learned via RIP.

<dt> <strong>-r</strong>
<dd> Used the RIP REQUEST command to request information from the
     gateway's routing table.  Unlike the RIP POLL command, all
     gateways should support the RIP REQUEST.  If there is no response
     to the RIP REQUEST command, the RIP POLL command is
     tried. <em>Gated</em> responds to a REQUEST command with all the
     routes he anounces out the specified interface.  Due to
     limitations in the UDP interface, on systems based on <em>BSD 4.3
     Reno</em> or earlier, REQUESTs respond about the interface used to
     route packets back to the sender.  This can be avoided by running
     <strong>ripquery</strong> on the host being queried.

<dt> <strong>-v</strong>
<dd> Version information about <strong>ripquery</strong> is displayed
     before querying the gateways.

<dt> <strong>-w</strong> <var>time</var>
<dd> Specifies the time in seconds to wait for the initial response
     from a gateway. The default value is 5 seconds.
