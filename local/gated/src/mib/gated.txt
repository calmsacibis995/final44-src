     1.  Status of this Memo
 
     This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
     experimental extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this
     memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the author.
 
 
     2.  Abstract
 
     This memo defines an enterprise portion of the Management
     Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
     protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
     defines objects for managing Gated.
 
     This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
     community.

     3.  The Network Management Framework
 
     The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of
     three components.  They are:
 
     RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
     RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which
     is wholly consistent with the SMI.
 
     RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 defines MIB-II,
     an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and
     new operational requirements.
 
     RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.
 
     The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

     4.  Objects
 
     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
     One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
     object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
     object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
     specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
     object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
     instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
     use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
     refer to the object type.
 
     The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
     structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
     language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
     purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
     These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
 
     The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
     is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
     tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
     how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
     the network.
 
     The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
     [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
     SNMP.
 
 
     4.1.  Format of Definitions
 
     Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
     types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
     defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
     by the extensions specified in [9,10].
