/*
 * This routine is now obsolete.  It used to be possible to request
 * more than one ticket at a time from the authentication server, and
 * it looks like this routine was used by the server to package the
 * tickets to be returned to the client.
 */

/*
 * This routine adds a new ticket to the ciphertext to be returned to
 * the client.  The routine takes the ciphertext (which doesn't get
 * encrypted till later), the number of the ticket (i.e. 1st, 2nd,
 * etc) the session key which goes in the ticket and is sent back to
 * the user, the lifetime for the ticket, the service name, the
 * instance, the realm, the key version number, and the ticket itself.
 *
 * This routine returns 0 (KSUCCESS) on success, and 1 (KFAILURE) on
 * failure.  On failure, which occurs when there isn't enough room
 * for the ticket, a 0 length ticket is added.
 *
 * Notes: This routine must be called with successive values of n.
 * i.e. the ticket must be added in order.  The corresponding routine
 * on the client side is extract ticket.
