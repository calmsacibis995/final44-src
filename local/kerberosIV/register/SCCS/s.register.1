.SH NAME
register \- register with Kerberos
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B register
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I register
command
is used to register a new user with Kerberos.
The Kerberos server keeps record of certain trusted hosts
from which it will accept new registrations.
If the host on which
.I register
is run is trusted by Kerberos, the user
is asked for his current password, and then
a new password to be used with Kerberos.
A user may only register with Kerberos one time.
