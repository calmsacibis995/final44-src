       A host name must be specified either as the first  command

       mand line arguments are given,  the  last  one  to  appear
       takes precedence.

       _r_k_i_n_i_t  is  a program that allows a user to establish ker-
       beros tickets on a remote host registered for rlogin  ser-
       vice.   This can be done without the user's kerberos pass-
       word ever leaving the client machine.

       In order to establish tickets remotely without the use  of
       something  like  _r_k_i_n_i_t_,  one  would have to log in to the
       remote host and run _k_i_n_i_t(1).  _r_k_i_n_i_t followed  by  _r_l_o_g_i_n
       can be thought of as a safe substitute for _r_l_o_g_i_n followed
       _k_i_n_i_t_.

       _r_k_i_n_i_t uses the same access checking mechanism as  _r_l_o_g_i_n_.
       That  means  that _r_k_i_n_i_t can be used to create any tickets
       for user _A on remote host _B if and  only  if  _A's  tickets
       would  entitle a login to _B_.  This means that one can cre-
       ate remote tickets for himself or for another user  if  he
       is in that user's .klogin file.

       _r_k_i_n_i_t understands the following command line options:


       --pp _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
           If  _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l_,  in  the  format _n_a_m_e_[_._i_n_s_t_]_[_@_r_e_a_l_m_] is
           specified, the tickets created on the remote host will
           be  the  tickets indicated by the _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l field.  If
           this option is not given, the following  defaults  are
           used: If the user running _r_k_i_n_i_t does not have tickets
           on the client machine, _r_k_i_n_i_t will prompt for a  pass-
           word and behave effectively as if the user had invoked
           _k_i_n_i_t on the specified remote host; i.e., the  tickets
           established  will  be  owned on the remote host by the
           user who invoked _r_k_i_n_i_t and  will  be  for  the  local
           realm  of the remote host.  If the user running _r_k_i_n_i_t
           already has tickets, _r_k_i_n_i_t will prompt for a password
           and create tickets whose principal matches that of the

           tickets that the user already has.



       --ll _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
           If _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e is  specified,  the  ticket  file  on  the
           remote host will be owned by the user _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e_.  If it
           is not specified, the tickets will  be  owned  by  the
           remote  user whose login name matches that of the user
           invoking _r_k_i_n_i_t_.


       --rr _r_e_a_l_m
           _r_e_a_l_m is used to tell _r_k_i_n_i_t  what  realm  the  remote
           host is in.  This option should not usually have to be
           used since _r_k_i_n_i_t uses _k_r_b___r_e_a_l_m_o_f_h_o_s_t(3) to determine
           the  remote  host's kerberos realm.  Note that this is
           distinct from realm as specified in  _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l_,  which
           refers to the realm of the remote tickets.


       --ff _t_i_c_k_e_t___f_i_l_e
           This  option is used to specify the name of the ticket
           file that should be used on  the  remote  host.   Note
           that  if  you  specify  a location for the ticket file
           that is other than the default, you will have  to  set
           the  environment  variable  KRBTKFILE to that filename
           once you get to the remote host in order  for  you  to
           use  the  tickets.  If a ticket file is not specified,
           the tickets will be placed in the default location  as
           specified  by  _t_k_t___f_i_l_e(3).   On  a UNIX host, this is
           /tmp/tkt<uid>, where <uid> is the user id of the  per-
           son who owns the remote ticket file.


       --hh _r_e_m_o_t_e___h_o_s_t
           _r_e_m_o_t_e  _h_o_s_t  is  the host on which remote tickets are
           being obtained.  This option can be used in  place  of
           specifying  the  host  as the first command line argu-
           ment.


       --tt _t_i_c_k_e_t___l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e
           _t_i_c_k_e_t _l_i_f_e_t_i_m_e is the  lifetime  in  minutes  of  the
           remote  tickets.   If it is not specified, the default
           ticket life time (as defined in krb.h) is used.


       --nnoottiimmeeoouutt
           prevents the client from timing out.  This  is  mainly
           useful only for debugging since the rkinit server also
