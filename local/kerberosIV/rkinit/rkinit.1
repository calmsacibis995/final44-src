.SH NAME
rkinit \- establish kerberos tickets safely on a remote host
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rkinit [ host ]
[ -p
.B principal 
] [ -l 
.B username
] [ -k 
.B kerberos_realm
] [ -f
.B ticket_file
] [ -h
.B remote_host
] [ -t
.B ticket_lifetime 
] [ 
.B \-notimeout 
]

A host name must be specified either as the first command line
argument or following a \-h flag.  If redundant command line
arguments are given, the last one to appear takes precedence.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rkinit
is a program that allows a user to establish kerberos tickets on
a remote host registered for
rlogin service.  This can be done without the user's kerberos
password ever leaving the client machine.

In order to establish tickets remotely
without the use of something like 
.I rkinit, 
one would have to log in to the
remote host and run 
.IR kinit (1).
.I rkinit 
followed by 
.I rlogin 
can be thought of as a safe substitute for
.I rlogin
followed 
.I kinit.

.I rkinit
uses the same access checking mechanism as 
.I rlogin.
That means that 
.I rkinit 
can be used to create any tickets for user 
.I A
on remote host 
.I B 
if and only if 
.IR A 's
tickets would entitle a login to 
.I B.
This means that one can create remote tickets for himself or for
another user if he is in that user's .klogin file.

.I rkinit
understands the following command line options:

.TP 4
.B \-p \fIprincipal\fR
If 
.I principal,
in the format 
.I name[.inst][@realm] 
is specified, the tickets created on the remote host will be the
tickets indicated by the 
.I principal
field.  If this option is not given, the following defaults are
used: If the user running 
.I rkinit
does not have tickets on the client machine, 
.I rkinit
will prompt for a password and behave effectively as if the user
had invoked 
.I kinit
on the specified 
remote host; i.e., 
the tickets established will be owned on the remote host
by the user who invoked 
.I rkinit 
and will be for the local realm of the
remote host.
If the user running 
.I rkinit
already has tickets, 
.I rkinit 
will prompt for a password and create tickets whose principal
matches that of the 
tickets that the user already has.


.TP 
.B \-l \fIusername\fR
If 
.I username
is specified, the ticket file on the remote host will be owned by the
user 
.I username.  
If it is not specified, the tickets will be owned by
the remote user whose login name matches that of the user invoking
.I rkinit.

.TP 
.B \-r \fIrealm\fR
.I realm
is used to tell 
.I rkinit 
what realm the remote host is in.  This
option should not usually have to be used since 
.I rkinit
uses 
.IR krb_realmofhost (3)
to determine the remote host's kerberos realm.  Note that this
is distinct from realm as specified in 
.I principal,
which refers to the realm of the remote tickets.

.TP 
.B \-f \fIticket_file\fR
This option is used to specify the name of the ticket file that
should be used on the remote host.  Note that if you
specify a location for the ticket file that is other
than the default, you will have to set the environment variable
KRBTKFILE to that filename once you get to the remote host in
order for you to use the tickets.
If a ticket file is not specified, the tickets will 
be placed in the 
default location as specified by 
.IR tkt_file (3). 
On a UNIX host, this is /tmp/tkt<uid>, where
<uid> is the user id of the person who owns the remote ticket file.

.TP 
.B \-h \fIremote_host\fR
.I remote host
is the host on which remote tickets are being obtained.  This
option can be used in place of specifying the host as the first
command line argument.

.TP 
.B \-t \fIticket_lifetime\fR
.I ticket lifetime
is the lifetime in minutes of the remote tickets.  If it is not
specified, the default ticket life time (as defined in krb.h) is
used. 

.TP 
.B \-notimeout
prevents the client from timing out.  This is mainly useful only
for debugging since the rkinit server also times out.

.SH EXAMPLES

In the following examples, 
.B tabetha 
and 
.B soup 
are machines in the
.B ATHENA.MIT.EDU 
kerberos realm and 
.B local 
is a user who can log in
to 
.B soup 
and has 
.B qjb.root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU 
in his .klogin file.


% rkinit tabetha
.br
Kerberos initialization (tabetha)

Password for qjb@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:

.br
% rkinit soup -p qjb.root -l local
.br
