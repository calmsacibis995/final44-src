       _r_k_i_n_i_t_d is the  server  for  _r_k_i_n_i_t_.   See  _r_k_i_n_i_t(1)  for
       information  about  _r_k_i_n_i_t_.  _r_k_i_n_i_t_d is started from inetd
       and must be run as root or be installed setuid(root) as it
       needs to be able to read /etc/athena/srvtab and change its
       uid to create tickets.

       _r_k_i_n_i_t_d times out in 60 seconds if the transaction is  not
       completed.

       _r_k_i_n_i_t_d  must  be  running on a machine that is registered
       for rlogin service; that is, the host must have  a  srvtab
       containing  an  rcmd.<host>  key where <host> is the value
       returned by the _k_r_b___g_e_t___p_h_o_s_t(3) kerberos library call.
