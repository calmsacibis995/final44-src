/*
 * Derived from original program by A. Dain Samples.
 * 
 * The program chgbars will accept the output from a diff comparison of
 * two versions of a file.  It will then read the new version of the file
 * and insert the appropriate troff commands to put change bars in the
 * right margin. Typing 'chgbars' without any arguments will give you
 * some documentation and an example.
 * 
 * Caveat: If you make a change inside an equation or table, the
 * preprocessors eqn and tbl may not like what chgbars does to the file.
 * You may have to go into the output from chgbars to remove or rearrange
 * some of the lines of the form '.mc |  \"open' or '.mc  \"close' in
 * order to get through tbl or eqn.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, users of RCS will be disappointed: one cannot use rcsdiff.
 * Rcsdiff compares the files in the wrong order.
 * 
 * There is a relatively easy way to do the job with the tools sed and awk.
 * However, sed does not allow enough commands to process large documents.
 * In the true spirit of a filter/tool, chgbars is limited only by the
 * amount of memory on the machine, and is fast and useful.
 * 
 * The modifications necessary are outlined:
 * 
 * FORM OF DIFF OUTPUT	COMMENT			NEW SED COMMANDS
 * ================================================================
 * 100a			means those lines	100a\\
 * L1			were deleted from	.mc |\\
 * L2			oldfile			.mc
 * :
 * Ln
 * .
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 100c			
 * L1		
 * L2	
 * : 
 * Ln						
 * .
 *	means that line 100 in newfile replaced all those lines in oldfile.
 *		100a
 *		.mc
 *		99 a
 *		.mc |
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 100d			that line was added	100a\\
 *			to oldfile		.mc
 *						99a\\
 *						.mc |
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 100,200d		those lines were	200a\\
 *			added to oldfile		.mc
 *						99a\\
 *						.mc |
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 100,200c		
 * L1		
 * L2	
 * :
 * Ln
 * .
 *	means lines 100 to 200 of newfile replaced all the following lines
 *	in oldfile.
 *		200a
 *		.mc
 *		99a
 *		.mc |
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
