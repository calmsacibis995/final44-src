.TH CATDVI 1 LOCAL
.SH NAME
catdvi \- convert C/A/T files to DVI format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B catdvi
[ options ] [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I catdvi
converts
.I file,
which should be in C/A/T format (i.e.
.I troff
output), to DVI format for printing on an Imprint-10 printer.
If no file name is given, the standard input is used.
The options are:
.TP
.BI  \-c n
Prints
.I n
copies.
.TP
.B  \-b
The next argument is printed on the banner page to identify this listing.
.TP
.B  \-i
The next argument is the name of the output file.
.TP
.B  \-v
Produces more verbose output.
.TP
.B  \-d
Produces extensive output for debugging.
.TP
.B  \-C
The next argument is the name of a character mapping table.  It
will be assumed to be in a standard directory unless it begins with /.
If not given, ``catab'' is used.
.PP
If the
.B \-i
flag is not used, the output is written to a temporary file and,
upon completion of processing, the input (C/A/T) file is unlinked
and
.I dviimp
is called to process the output of
.I catdvi.
The
.B \-v
and
.B \-d
flags will be passed on to
.I dviimp
if specified.
.PP
Since the
.B \-b
and
.B \-c
flags are merely passed to
.I dviimp,
they have no effect if
.B \-i
is used.
.SH FILES
/tmp/dvi??????
.SH SEE ALSO
dviimp(1), itroff(1)
.SH BUGS
Not all symbols are handled properly.
.PP
Boxes generated by
.I tbl
sometimes are drawn over several pages, the text being filled in separately.
This is impossible to do on a page printer without extensive sorting, which
is not done.
.PP
Many minor problems occur because of the difference in resolution between
the C/A/T phototypesetter and the IMPRINT-10.
