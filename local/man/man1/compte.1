The object of the game is to use one or more of the six given factors, along with
the arithmetic operations of addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), and division (/) to come as close as possible
to the target number using the smallest number of factors.
Each factor may be used only once for each appearance in the given set.

The program will either generate puzzles at random and give you time
to work on it, or will accept a puzzle as input and try to solve it
as quickly as possible.
In either case, it will print out the best solution it can find.
