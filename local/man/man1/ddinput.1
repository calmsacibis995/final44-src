.I ddinput
Is a simple inputting program for the DDBS system.

and then using the information contained therein
prompts repeatedly for information which is used
to fill out the item.
The program quits upon receipt of an interrupt (normally 
caused by pressing rub-out).
.SH FORMAT

The format of a DDBS file is as follows:
.sp
A series of lines of the form:
<key><space><data>
followed by a line containing only a dollar sign.
comprises an "item".

address 433 Oak St.
phone 455-5656
$

.fi

Here are 2 items.
"name", "address", "phone" are the key words.
The remainders of the lines are the data fields.

Lines may contain information which spans more than one line.
A back space at the end of a line signifies continuation 
to the next line as in:

.nf

To set up a new data base using ddinput, you
should hand craft the first item, you need only list the 
keys, one to a line.

Then type: ddinput filename
