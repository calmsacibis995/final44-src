.SH NAME
dict \*- dictionary for ddbs data
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A data dictionary aids in data entry and data verification
by requiring uniformity in the data.  The dictionary consists
of all legal entries and their predefined spellings.
By specifying in the specification file that the entry must match
an entry in a dictionary, the programs \fIcheckin\fR and
\fIcheckout\fR will insure that only legal data is entered.  
A dictionary may define as many entries as are required, and each
info system may define the data differently.  For Example,
one user may define instructor names with two first initials
while another uses only one initial.
.PP
The format for a dictionary is comprised of three parts:
.IP
The first line of an entry definition is a string beginning
in column nine (9 spaces from the left margin) and describing 
the type of entries.
.IP
The second part is a list of the specification file keys whose 
fields must contain one of the legal entries.  A dollar sign
precedes each keyword.
.IP
The third part contains all entries defined as legal, one to 
a line.
