.TH DIFFTC LOCAL
.SH NAME
difftc - find differences in termcap files or entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
difftc [\-f tcfile] entry1 entry2
.br
.B
difftc \-f tcfile1 \-f tcfile2 [entry1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Difftc
runs
.I diff(1)
on two termcap files or entries to determine the similarities.
This is very helpful in picking apart very long or complex termcap entries,
or in determining what the differences are in two versions of the termcap
database.
.PP
The first form diffs two entries from the same termcap file.
For example,
to find out the differences in the c108-4p and c108-8p entries in the
file /tmp/ntermcap,
you would type:
.TP
.B
% difftc \-f /tmp/ntermcap c108-4p c108-8p
.PP
and the output would look something like:

.nf
1c1
< cS,c108-4p,concept108-4p,concept 108 w/4 pages
---
> c8,c108,c108-8p,concept108-8p,concept 108 w/8 pages

.PP
The second form is used to diff entries in different files,
or to diff two entire termcap databases.  This output could be very
long if the databases are not very similar.
