and send the data to the form daemon formd, which prints out a

.I form -n
.PP
When entering the primary information in form (in graphics mode),
you may hit return when prompted for information to leave it unchanged.
.I form
will keep prompting for information untill a ^D is hit at the
beginning of a field.  
Thus if you make a mistake in one of the fields, you can keep hitting
return untill you are again prompted for that information and reenter it.
A return will never change a field.  The current data is displayed on the 
bottom of the screen.
.PP
It will then ask for a job description,
which is also terminated by a ^D at the beginning of a line.
