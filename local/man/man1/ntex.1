\SH NAME
ntex - format to terminal for \TeX
\SH SYNOPSIS
\I ntex
[ -s ] [ -q ] [ -i\<tex-file\> ] [ input-filename ]
\SH DESCRIPTION
\PP
\I \nTeX{}
puts an ascii version of the formatted \TeX\ file on the standard output.
This allows one to preview a document on a normal crt display.  This
program is actually a shell script that drives the normal \TeX\ program
(with special modifications for the terminal character set) and then
converts the \TeX\ DVI output file into an ascii file.
\PP
\I \nTeX{}
works much like
\IR nroff(1)
in it's operating format (in fact, \nTeX\ is designed to be to \TeX\ what
nroff is to troff).  The input file can be given as an argument (and
more than one file may be given) or the program will read it's standard
input for the file.  \nTeX\ places the concatenation of all the files
on the standard output after they have been converted into ascii files
suitable for viewing on a terminal.
\PP
The options
\I \nTeX{}
understands are as follows:
\IP -s
specifies the ``\\scrollmode'' feature of \TeX.  Error messages are
handled as well as possible by \TeX\ and compilation does not pause.
\IP -q
specifies
\B silent
mode.  No error or diagnostic output from \TeX\ or dvilpr is printed and
\TeX\ is given the ``\\batchmode'' command to prevent it from stopping
for or printing errors.
\IP -i
allows the user to give a filename that should be ``input'' by
each file on the command line (or the standard input).  This is done
by inserting a command of the form ``\\input file.tex'' at the
top of the .tex file as it is created.  Note: the filename must come
after the ``-i'' without spaces, not as two separate arguments.
