.SH NAME
psif, psof, psgf, psnf, pstf \- printcap filters for P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B PSLIB/psfilters
[ 
.I spooler filter arguments
] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I psfilters
are meant to be entries for a \*(PS printer in the printer description file 
.IR /etc/printcap.
Each filter accepts a file on standard input and, performing appropriate 
translation, sends a \*(PS file to the standard output.
The options are as specified in the
.I 4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual.  
The program
.I psif
is the lowest level filter.  It manages communication with the printer,
error handling, status reporting, etc.
It distinguishes between text files (which get formatted) and \*(PS print 
files by examination for a \*(PS 
.B magic number
\- \*(PS files are distinguished by their first two characters being ``%!''.
All other filters 
.I exec psif
at the far end of a pipe, the nearer end doing translation to \*(PS only.
.PP
.I psgf, psnf, and pstf,
are the filters for
.IR plot (5), 
.IR ditroff (1), 
and
.IR  troff (1)
respectively.  
.I psof
is responsible for generating job break pages (it leaves information in
a file called
.I ".banner"
in the printer spooling directory which 
.I psif
inspects and prints.
.I psif 
also accepts any \*(PS print file, such as those generated by Scribe.
Other filter entries, such as those for 
.I TeX DVI 
files,
.I cifplot,
and raw raster data are not yet in place, and may be available from
other sources.
.I psfilters
are usually invoked by giving the appropriate option to
.IR lpr (1).
It is not correct to invoke 
.I psfilters
directly.  More flexibility in format conversion may be achieved by
avoiding the filter/translation step via an
.I lpr
option, and invoking a translator directly \- see 
.IR psdit (1),
and
.IR ptroff (1)
for more information.
