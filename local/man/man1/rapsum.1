.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rapsum
[ -adn ] userlog
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I rapsum
command is used to report a summary of the user log created from a
rapid (1) or tdi (1) run. 
It takes as input the user log and depending on the
flags chosen, a sorted summary is output on the standard output device.
The expected input file must
be in the format created by the rapid \fI-u\fR flag
or the tdi \fI-u\fR flag.
The Unix \fIsort\fR command is used for \fIrapsum\fR.
Actions accessed are considered as nodes and the summary includes the number of
times the action was called in a diagram.
The three flags described below are exclusive of one another.
