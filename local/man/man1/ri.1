.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Ri
is the RIGEL translator.
.I Ri
translates the RIGEL source code found in the file in \fIsource-file\fP
(which should end with \fB.r\fP,
for main programs, or \fB.m\fP,
for module files) into an interpreter executable form to be executed by
\fIrx\fP.
The object code is stored in the file \fItree-file\fP, if the 
.B \-o
option is given, else in the file \fItree\fP in the
users directory. The tree can be examined using \fIptp\fP.
.PP
The following options are recognized by \fIri\fP:

number of pages is 8.
.IP \fB\-Q\fP
Suppresses the normal printing of statistics about memory and
syntax error count.
.IP \fB\-S\fP
Print the states the parser progresses through.
.IP \fB\-T\fP
Print the lexical tokens in their C defined decimal
form.
.IP \fB\-Z\fP
Print the string table statistics at the end of the
translation.
.IP \fB\-g\fP
