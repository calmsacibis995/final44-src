.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sortrefs
reads references from each
.I file,
sorts the references based on the keywords generated by
.I /usr/lib/refer/hunt
(senior author's last name is the primary sort key),
eliminates duplicates,
and creates new reference files containing the sorted references.
The names of the old reference files are used as a basis for the names
of the new files: a reference is placed into the output file which corresponds
to the first input file in which that reference was found.
Since \fIsortrefs\fP maintains the distribution of references among files,
different files can be used to contain references on different topics,
and \fIsortrefs\fP can still be used to keep these files duplicate-free.
.PP
If the \fB-r\fP option is given, the names of the output files are identical
to the names of the input files, and the old files are overwritten
(any output file which contains no references is removed).
Otherwise, a prefix is contatenated with the input file names to create the
output names.
The \fB-p\fP option can be used to specify this prefix (it may be any string
which is legal in a file name).
The default prefix is 'S'.
.PP
\fISortrefs\fP aids in the performance of two common
reference database maintenance operations.
The first is the addition of new references.
References can simply be appended to the end of the appropriate file
(creating new files as desired).
Running \fIsortrefs\fP will move the new references to their appropriate
position within the file, removing duplicates as necessary.
.PP
The second is merging two data bases.
Files containing references on the same topic can simply be concatenated
together, or the user may wish to manually redistribute references according
to topic.
Then, \fIsortrefs\fP can be used to eliminate duplicates, etc.
Another method (which might require less manual work in some cases)
would be to first eliminate all duplicates from the new reference files
by running sortrefs, listing all old reference files before any new ones.
The files created from the new reference files by sortrefs will then
contain only truly new references, which then can be distributed as desired.
.PP

bib(1), refer(1)
.SH BUGS
If two or more references are not identical (as far as \fIhunt\fP is concerned),all such references will be included in the output files.
For example, if one reference gives the full first name for an author and
another doesn't, both references will be included in the output.
This will cause \fIbib\fP and \fIrefer\fP to complain about duplicate hits.
