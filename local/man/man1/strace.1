.TH STRACE 1 local
.SH NAME
strace \- enable/disable filesystem tracing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/strace
[
.B -t 
] file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Strace
turns on or turns off 
.I STRACE
filesystem tracing.
.I File
should be either the word
.I off
or the name of an existing file which will contain the trace output.
You should turn off tracing first, in order to change the
trace output file.  The
.B -t
flag causes the system to truncate the file.
.PP
The trace output file contains binary records whose form is
defined by 
.I strace.h.
.PP
The trace file may be viewed using the program
.IR tread (1).
.PP
You must be the super-user to use this program.
.SH FILES
the trace output file
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An ``Invalid argument'' message when trying to turn on tracing
probably means that tracing is already on.

.SH BUGS
The trace file collects a small number of garbage words.  Cursory
analysis using
.IR od (1)
indicates that random pieces of previous trace records are being
thrown out onto the file.  This implies that there is a buffering
problem somewhere in the kernel level code, but exactly where
that problem is isn't obvious.
