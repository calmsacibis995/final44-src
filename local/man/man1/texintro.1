\- An introduction to TeX-related software
.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP 12
.I bibtex
Creates a bibliography list for LaTeX documents.  It takes
the \fI.aux\fR file generated by \fIlatex\fR and returns a \fI.bbl\fR 
file.  The bibliography database must preexist with a \fI.bib\fR
extension.  See bibtex(l) for details.
.TP 12 
.I bibtex.ml
A Gosling Emacs profile that assists one to generate/preview a 
BibTeX \fI.bib\fR file.  For details, see the comments in beginning of
\fIbibtex.ml\fR.
.TP 12
.I chtopx
Converts from the human-readable character representation of a font back to
the binary PXL format.  Both input and output file names must be
specified.
.TP 12
.I delatex
Strips off LaTeX commands from a LaTeX document and returns
all words to standard output.
.TP 12
.I detex
Strips off TeX commands from a TeX document and returns
all words to standard output.
See detex(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I dvilpr
Converts a DVI file to its ASCII approximation.  This program is
not fully debugged.  See dvilpr(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I dviselect
Extracts specific pages or sections from DVI files.
See dviselect(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I dvitool
DVI previewer for the SUNs under the \fIsuntools\fR window system.
See dvitool(l) for details. 
.TP 12
.I dvitype
Checks if a DVI file is legitimate and converts it to a
human-readable mnemonic form with each actual
bit raster filled by a `*'.  The output is in
the file \fIdvitype.out\fR.  
.TP 12
.I fontcheck
Checks if any fonts needed by a DVI file are missing in the
PXL directory for a specific typesetter.  The particular
printer is specified with a -P option as in lpr.  Note: this
is only useful on the host which spools for a particular
printer since this program uses the printer specific DVI driver.
.TP 12
.I gftodvi
Converts a GF font to a DVI file which serves as
the proof sheet for the font.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I gftopxl
Converts a GF font to its corresponding PXL format for use
by DVI drivers.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I gftype
Checks if a GF font is legitimate, converts each character in the
font to some mnemonic commands, and prints each actual bit raster with a `*'.
Unlike \fIdvitype\fR, however,
both input and output file names need be specified here.  (Inconsistent?
That's life!)
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I inimf
The primitive version of Metafont with no macro packages preloaded.  
This can be used to create customized fast loading versions of
Metafont.  After the desired macros are loaded, the \\dump
command will create a \fIbase\fR file (the \fI.base\fR file) which
can then be fast loaded by \fIvirmf\fR.
Currently this runs on the SUNs only.
.TP 12
.I initex
The primitive version of TeX with no macro packages preloaded.
This can be used to create customized fast loading versions of
TeX.  After the desired macros are loaded, the \\dump
command will create a \fIformat\fR file (the \fI.fmt\fR file) which
can then be fast loaded by \fIvirtex\fR.
See initex(l) for details.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I latex
A version of TeX with the macro package \fIlplain.tex\fR preloaded
that gives Scribe-like document structure.  A number of predefined
document styles (e.g. paper, article, ..., etc.) are available
as \fI.sty\fR files in the TeX library area.
.TP 12
.I latexdvi
Invokes \fIlatex\fR first and then calls \fIdvitool\fR automatically.
This is available on the SUNs only.  See latexdvi(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I mf
Metafont with \fIplain.base\fR preloaded.  Currently
this runs on the SUNs only.
.TP 12
.I ntex
Puts an ASCII version of the formatted TeX file (i.e. DVI)
to the standard output (\fIntex\fR to \fItex\fR is as \fInroff\fR to
\fItroff\fR).  See ntex(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I patgen
Hyphenation pattern generator.
.TP 12
.I pltotf
Makes a TFM file from the human-readable PL format.
Both input and output file names must be specified.
.TP 12
.I pxtoch
Converts a font from the PXL format to a human-readable
character representation with each actual bit raster filled by a `*'.
Both input and output file names must be specified.
.TP 12
.I pxtool
An interactive font editor for the PXL files.
This program runs on the SUNs under the \fIsuntools\fR window system.
See pxtool(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I r2bib
Converts a \fIrefer\fR file to a BibTeX file as standard output.
See refer(1), r2bib(l), and bibtex(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I scalepx
scales a pixel font file by an arbitrary amount.  Usage is
``scalepx percentage old-file new-file'' where percentage is
any integer and
.B old-file
is an existing pixel font.  Scalepx
will make a copy of
.B old-file
in
.B new-file
except that all the
bitmaps will be scaled by the 
.B percentage
amount.  This program uses a rather simple linear scaling algorithm
so that large blowups typically don't come out well.
.TP 12
.I slitex
A version of TeX with the macro package \fIsplain.tex\fR preloaded
which is a superset of LaTeX plus some slides making commands.
.TP 12
.I slitexdvi
Like \fIlatex\fR but invokes \fIslitex\fR first.
See slitexdvi(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I tangle
A WEB processor that takes a \fI.web\fR file and a compiler-specific
change file (the \fI.ch\fR file) and returns a \fI.p\fR file
which is the corresponding Pascal program.
See tangle(l) for details.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I tex
TeX with the macro package \fIplain.tex\fR preloaded.
Currently this program uses the AM (for \fIAmerican Modern\fR)
series of fonts (so does \fIlatex\fR).  
See tex(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I texdvi
Like \fIlatex\fR but invokes \fItex\fR first.
See texdvi(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I tftopl
Makes a human-readable dump of a TFM file to the PL format.
Both input and output file names must be specified.
.TP 12
.I tgrind
Grinds nice source listings using TeX similarly to vgrind, etc.
See tgrind(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I undump
Converts a core dump to an executable \fIa.out\fR file.
If core dump (^\\) was issued during the session of \fIvirmf\fR or 
\fIvirtex\fR, \fIundump\fR can be used to make the core dump an
executable.  See undump(l) for details.
.TP 12
.I virmf
A version of Metafont that expects \fI.base\fR files created
by \fIinimf\fR as inputs.  The loading of \fI.base\fR files is fast.
In essence, \fImf\fR is virtex with \fIplain.base\fR loaded.
Currently this program runs on the SUNs only.
.TP 12
.I virtex
A version of TeX that expects \fI.fmt\fR files created
by \fIinitex\fR as inputs.  The loading of \fI.fmt\fR files is fast.
In essence, \fItex\fR is virtex with \fIplain.fmt\fR loaded.
See virtex(l) for details.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).
.TP 12
.I weave
A WEB processor that takes a \fI.web\fR file and
a compiler-specific change file (the \fI.ch\fR file)
and returns a \fI.tex\fR file
which is the Pascal source with structured documentation. 
See weave(l) for details.
This program is only available on the base TeX hosts (currently renoir).

.SH AUTHORS (or BITS OF HISTORY)
.PP
TeX and Metafont were designed by Donald E. Knuth of Stanford, 
who implemented them using his WEB system for Pascal programs.
Font formats were by and large designed by David Fuchs, student of Knuth.
Most WEB/TeX/Metafont utilities, such as \fItangle\fR, 
\fIweave\fR, \fIpxtopl\fR, \fIgftopxl\fR, ..., etc.,
were implemented by Knuth and his associates.
Specifically, Knuth implemented the WEB system and
its processors \fItangle\fR and \fIweave\fR.  Frank Liang wrote
the \fIpatgen\fR program.  Lynn Ruggles developed \fIpxtoch\fR and
\fIchtopx\fR.  
.PP
The LaTeX and SliTeX macro packages, their related fonts,
and their predefined \fI.sty\fR files
have been developed by Leslie Lamport of DEC western research
(formerly at SRI).  BibTeX was written by Oren Patashnik of Stanford
under the direction of Lamport (with the UNIX change file from Howard
Trickey).  The program \fIr2bib\fR was supplied by Rusty Wright of U. C. 
San Diego.  Chris Torek of University of Maryland wrote \fIdviselect\fR
and several Imagen/Versatec DVI drivers installed locally.
University of Utah's Spencer Thomas contributed \fIundump\fR.
.PP
At Berkeley, TeX software is maintained and developed primarily
by the VorTeX group.  
Jeff McCarrell wrote \fIdvitool\fR based on the earlier
\fIdvisun\fR which was the result of several people's work.
He also developed the \fItexdvi\fR series of programs.
John Coker wrote \fIpxtool\fR.  These tools are SUN specific.
John also wrote \fIscalepx\fR, \fIfontcheck\fR, \fIntex\fR, and the
\fIman.tex\fR TeX macro package.
The Emacs profile \fIbibtex.ml\fR was written by Peehong Chen.
Other people in the community have also contributed their efforts.
Paul Hilfinger wrote \fIdvilpr\fR which John Coker enhanced to
become \fIntex\fR.  
Van Jacobson of LBL modified the \fIvgrind\fR program and
came up with \fItgrind\fI.
.PP
TeX was initially ported to Berkeley UNIX at Stanford by Howard Trickey (now
with AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill), and
at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.  The VAX versions of TeX currently running are
a combination of their contributions.  
The SUN TeX port was independently carried out by people at three locations:
Mike Harrison and Charles Perkins at U. C. Berkeley, Rusty Wright at U. C. San
Diego, and Steve Correll at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.  The versions
of the files running on the SUNs are a merge of their work.
Paul Richards of University of Illinois has been in charge of
UNIX Metafont ports.
.PP
University of Maryland's Richard Furuta (formerly with University
of Washington), the UNIX TeX coordinator, has been responsible for
new releases of TeX-related software.
Effective October 1985, Pierre MacKay of Washington has assumed
many of Furuta's duties.
Software written by the VorTeX group is distributed by Berkeley.
