.TH TF 1
.SH NAME
tf  -- Troll relation formatter 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tf
filename [  -T [string1]  -H [string2] ... -H [stringN] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Tf is used to format tuples produced by the Troll copy command for
tables and reports, and serves as a link between Troll and tbl.
The output of the Troll copy command is one record
per tuple, with each tuple bounded by square brackets [ and ],
each attribute separated by commas, each string-valued
attribute surrounded by single quotes, and each null-valued
attribute represented by a sequence of question marks.
.LP
Tf strips out the brackets, commas, quote marks, and question marks,
inserts tabs between attributes in a tuple, and adds header 
information so that tf output can be piped directly to tbl.
.LP
If filename is in Troll copy format, the commands

	tf filename | tbl | nroff [options] 

will produce a set of columns of data in nroff format.
(The tf command also works with troff.)
.LP
The output of tf can also be directed to a file, so that the file may be edited before
being input to tbl. The resulting file may also be included (with the nroff/troff
so command) in a body of text to be formatted.
.LP
The -T and -H options provide for a title and column headings for
the displayed table.
The character '.' serves as a placeholder for omitted title and
header information, and leaves the corresponding position empty.

.SH BUGS
This is a very rudimentary formatting program.
