.TH TPG 1 
.SH NAME
tpg	- Troll page utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
tpg [-s] [-l<lines>] [-c<columns>] [-h <header>] [+<attributes>] [inputfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tpg
is an utility to tabulate files in Troll/USE tuple constructor format. 
It reads the tuples from standard input or an input file.
If an input file is given, the
table size is defined by the limits of the terminal in use.
The -h flag allows for the definition of a table header and
+<attributes> defines names for the columns.
The column names are represented by a comma separated list of
strings of the format <name> or <name>:<number>, where number
indicates the column size to be used.
.br
The -l and -c parameters can be used to alter the notion of the
video screen size.
.br
The -s flag results in a continuous stream of tables, which
can be saved and printed. For generating printer files, use the -l and -c
options to set the table size to the size of the line printer paper.
Moreover, -s is assumed whenever input is not coming from a terminal
or when output is not directed to a terminal.
