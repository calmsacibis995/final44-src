NAME
     vaxima - symbolic algebraic manipulation system (Macsyma)

SYNOPSIS
     vaxima

DESCRIPTION
     _v_a_x_i_m_a is a version of the MACSYMA algebraic manipulation
     system.  Vaxima is an interactive language and system that
     manipulates formulas representing mathematical expressions.
     Among its many capabilities: symbolic indefinite integration
     (``Freshman calculus problems''), expansion in power-series,
     trigonometric and algebraic simplification, multivariate
     polynomial factoring, arbitrary precision rational and
     floating-point arithmetic, etc.

     Vaxima was developed jointly by MIT and UC Berkeley. MIT has
     forbidden UCB from distributing this system directly, but it
     is available through the National Energy Software Center
     (NESC), Argonne Illinois.

     The massive manual, and a primer, is available from NESC or
     the Laboratory for Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA.

     In order to use vaxima under UNIX, you must specify, in your
     environment, a setting for the VAXIMA variable.  This is
     usually done by placing, in your .login file, a line such as
     setenv VAXIMA /usr/mac
     The directory name (i.e. /usr/mac above) must correspond to
     the library location for the vaxima ``autoload'' files. The
     vaxima program itself may be installed anywhere, but is
     often only a link to the executable file /usr/mac/svaxima.
     If your vaxima is installed correctly, an on-line precis of
     each command is available by typing describe(<command-
     name>); You might start out by typing
     describe(describe);
     If this command does not work, vaxima is incorrectly or
     incompletely installed.

     A very simple interaction which illustrates symbolic dif-
     ferentiation is the command diff(x^2+3*x,x);

FILES
     ~/.vaximarc	     optional initialization file read
     when vaxima starts up
     /usr/mac/*              various system & info files  (may be
     installed elsewhere...)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Many, some self-explanatory, some mysterious. The message
     ``Could not find file xxx/yyy'' when executing a command
     indicates your system is incompletely installed, or your
     VAXIMA environment variable is not set correctly.

     It may help to know that the system is implemented on top of
     Franz Lisp.  Typing control-D once gets you into Lisp, typ-
     ing control-D again gets you back into vaxima.

BUGS
     Undoubtedly. In general, all the documentation is out of
     date in minor respects. Three companies offer some type of
     support for vaxima and its close relatives: Symbolics Inc.,
     Cambridge, MA, Paradigm Assoc., Cambridge MA., and Franz
     Inc., Berkeley, CA.
