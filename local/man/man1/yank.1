.TH YANK UCB 10/21/79 UCB
.SH NAME
yank \- Give idle times for available patch board ports.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yank
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ti 8
Yank is intended to be used by people confronted with the dilemma
of which plug to pull out of the patch panel in 570 Evans.
It prints a table of tty names with their associated idle times,
listed most idle first.
.ti +5
Yank can be executed from login by typing `yank' in response
to `:login:'. In this case the program waits for you to finish
reading the table, asking that you type carriage-return when
you've finished.
