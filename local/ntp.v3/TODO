This file contains problems known to the authors that still need to be done.
We would appreciate if you could spare some of your time to look through
these topics and help us with some open questions. Most of the topics
pertain to specific architectures where we have no direct access or not
the time or expertise to currently track down the problem further.
If you don't know what we are talking about in the topics don't bother
with finding out - somebody else will probably solve that problem.

Before you try to send a solution to mills@udel.edu please check whether
this problem still exists in the distribution on louie.udel.edu.

Thank you for your help !
