# Sample key file, also used for testing.
#
# Note that there are three formats for keys.  Standard format is a
# hex format with the low order bit of each byte being a parity
# bit, a la the NBS standard.  NTP format is also hex, but uses the
# high order bit of each byte for parity.  Ascii format simply encodes
# a 1-8 character ascii string as a key.  Note that because of the
# simple tokenizing routine, the characters ' ', '#', '\t', '\n' and
# '\0' can't be used in an ascii key.  Everything else is fair game, though.
