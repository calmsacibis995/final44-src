README file for directory ./hints of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains files with hints for particular architectures.

All files are derived from the earlier README.<machine> files.
I have tried to adjust these files to match the current state of
affairs of this xntp distribution. The information contained in the
files may or may not be completely correct. But these files contain
valuable hints for specific architectures.
