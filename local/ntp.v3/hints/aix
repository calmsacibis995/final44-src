Problem with recent ANSI compilers

On some systems, including AIX, the compiler quits on the ntp_refclock.c
file when processing the refclock_report() routine. The problem, which
is eithre a feature or a bug, has to do with an unwanted promotion of
the u_char argument to an int and a failure of the compiler to recognize
the preceding prototype. A workaround is to use ANSI syntax to delare
the arguments. Since ANSI compilers are not universally available, this
syntax can't be used in the stock distribution.
