Included in this distribution of XNTP is a configuration file suitable
for use with the BSDI BSD/386 operation system.  It has been tested against
the version 1.0 "production release", but should work with any 0.9.X "gamma
release" version if anyone still cares.  I'm using the stock gcc provided
with the OS.

[ As the pmake is badly broken on these systems at the time of this writing
  the only way to compile is to call make like this "make -e MAKE=make [target]"
  - Frank Kardel - 93/12/3 ]

To date, I haven't used this with any hardware clocks, but I will probably
get around to trying a Spectracom WWVB receiver at some point, and I'm hacking
on an interface for the Rockwell Navcore 5 GPS widget in my "copious spare
time".

The config file is Config.bsdi, and the following steps should be all that
are required to install and use the bits.

To build the software:

	rm -f Config.local
	make refconf
	make

To install the software:

	make install

	This will place all of the executables in /usr/local/etc.  The config
	file is expected to be /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf and the key file for
	the optional authentication is /etc/ntp.keys.

	Craft a config file and a key file, and put them in the right places.
	There is information on how to do this elsewhere in the documentation,
	the only thing I'll mention is that I put the drift file in 
	/var/log/ntp.drift, and the authdelay on my 486DX/50 system is 
	0.000064.  Your mileage will vary, learn to use the authspeed tools
	if you're going to authenticate.
	
	In the file /etc/rc.local, make sure that the invocation of ntpd is
	commented out, and add an invocation of xntpd.  Here's what I'm using:

		echo -n 'starting local daemons:'

		if [ -f /etc/ntp.keys -a -f /usr/local/etc/xntp.conf ]; then
		    echo -n ' xntpd';           /usr/local/etc/xntpd
		fi

		#XXX# echo -n ' ntpd';          /usr/libexec/ntpd -t

At this point, you should be good to go.  Try running /usr/local/etc/xntpd and
using ntpq or xntpdc to see if things are working, then pay attention the next
time you reboot to make sure that xntpd is being invoked, and use ntpq or
xntpdc again to make sure all is well.  

Enjoy!
