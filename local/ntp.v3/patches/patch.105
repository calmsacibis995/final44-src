Foo; I did some diffs and nothing jumped out of the woods and
bit me on the nose; but it was just semi-idle curiousity anyway.
As long as it works now ... my apologies for it not being trivial
to merge in ... whatever it was that I did wrong :-|.

Sure; here's the one-line diff to enable monitor-mode by default.  I
dropped it in just before reading in the config file so that you can
still turn it off via the config file :-)

Oh, also including the one line diff to the xntpd man page too.

Thanks again,
