README file for directory ./scripts of the NTP Version 3 distribution

This directory contains shell and perl script files for the configuration,
monitoring and support of NTP installations. See the README and RELNOTES
files in the parent directory for directions on how to use these files.

Guess.sh        script to figure out what machine and operating system
                is running this thing. Prizes awarded for new machines
                added to the list.

autoconf        awesome script swiped from Jeff Johnson (who may have
                swiped it from GNU) which delves deep into the system
                files to reveal dark secrets necessary to port NTP to
                everything except sewing machines. Unfinished work.

makeconfig.sh   shell script that calles Guess.sh and then figures out
                what compiler is available, then builds the
                configuration file in the base directory. Finally, it
                launches the sed script Config.sed in the base directory
                to make the makefiles used by most programs.

                architecture maintenance

		sources
