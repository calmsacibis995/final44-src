NAME
     chghist - change the history entry of an SCCS delta

SYNOPSIS
     _c_h_g_h_i_s_t -rSID name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_h_g_h_i_s_t changes  the  history  information,  for  the  delta
     specified by the SID, of each named SCCS file.

     If a directory is named, _c_h_g_h_i_s_t behaves as though each file
     in the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the pathname does not  be-
     gin  with	``s.''),  and  unreadable files, are silently ig-
     nored.  If a name of ``-'' is given, the standard	input  is
     read;  each  line	of  the standard input is taken to be the
     name of an SCCS  file  to	be  processed.	 Again,  non-SCCS
     files, and unreadable files, are silently ignored.

     The exact permissions necessary to change the history  entry
     of  a  delta  are	documented in the _S_C_C_S/_P_W_B _U_s_e_r'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l.
     Simply stated, they are either (1) if you made a delta,  you
     can change its history entry; or (2) if you own the file and
     directory you can change a history entry.

     The new history is read from the  standard  input.   If  the
     standard  input  is a terminal, the program will prompt with
     ``MRs? '' (only if the file has a _v flag, see _a_d_m_i_n(I))  and
     with  ``comments? ''.  If the standard input is not a termi-
     nal, no prompt(s) is (are) printed.  A newline preceded by a
     ``\'' is read as a blank, and may be used to make the enter-
     ing of the history more convenient.  The first  newline  not
     preceded	by  a  ``\''  terminates  the  response  for  the
     corresponding prompt.

     When the history entry of a delta table record (see  _p_r_t(I))
     is  changed,  all	old  MR entries (if any) are converted to
     comments, and both these and the original comments are  pre-
     ceded  by	a comment line that indicates who made the change
     and when it was made. The new information is entered preced-
     ing  the  old.  No other changes are made to the delta table
     entry.
