NAME
     delta - make a delta (change) to an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     delta [-rSID] [-s] [-n] [-glist] [-m[mrlist]] [-y[comment]]
     [-p] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _D_e_l_t_a is used to permanently introduce into the  named  SCCS
     file  changes that were made to the file retrieved by _g_e_t(1)
     (called the _g-_f_i_l_e, or generated file).

     _D_e_l_t_a makes a delta to each named SCCS file.  If a directory
     is named, _d_e_l_t_a behaves as though each file in the directory
     were specified as a named file, except that  non-SCCS  files
     (last  component of the pathname does not begin with s.) and
     unreadable files are silently ignored.  If a name	of  -  is
     given,  the standard input is read (see WARNINGS); each line
     of the standard input is taken to be the  name  of  an  SCCS
     file to be processed.

     _D_e_l_t_a may issue prompts on  the  standard	output	depending
     upon  certain  keyletters specified and flags (see _a_d_m_i_n(1))
     that may be  present  in  the  SCCS  file	(see  -m  and  -y
     keyletters below).

     Keyletter arguments apply independently to each named file.

	  -r_S_I_D          Uniquely identifies which delta is to be
			 made  to the SCCS file.  The use of this
			 keyletter is necessary only  if  two  or
			 more  outstanding  _g_e_ts for editing (_g_e_t
			 -e) on the same SCCS file were  done  by
			 the  same  person (login name).  The SID
			 value specified with  the  -r	keyletter
			 can  be  either the SID specified on the
			 _g_e_t command line or the SID to  be  made
			 as  reported  by  the	_g_e_t  command (see
			 _g_e_t).	 A  diagnostic	results  if   the
			 specified   SID  is  ambiguous,  or,  if
			 necessary and	omitted  on  the  command
			 line.

	  -s		 Suppresses the issue,	on  the  standard
			 output,  of  the created delta's SID, as
			 well as the number  of  lines	inserted,
			 deleted and unchanged in the SCCS file.

	  -n		 Specifies retention of the edited _g-_f_i_l_e
			 (normally removed at completion of delta
			 processing).

	  -g_l_i_s_t	 Specifies a _l_i_s_t  (see  _g_e_t(1)  for  the
			 definition  of  <_l_i_s_t>)  of deltas which
			 are to  be  _i_g_n_o_r_e_d  when  the  file  is
			 accessed   at	the  change  level  (SID)
			 created by this delta.

	  -m[_m_r_l_i_s_t]	 If the SCCS file has the v flag set (see
			 _a_d_m_i_n(1))  then  a  Modification Request
			 (MR) number _m_u_s_t be supplied as the rea-
			 son for creating the new delta.

			 If -m is not used and the standard input
			 is  a	terminal,  the prompt ``MRs?'' is
			 issued on the standard output before the
			 standard  input is read; if the standard
			 input is not a terminal,  no  prompt  is
			 issued.  _T_h_e ``MRs?'' _p_r_o_m_p_t _a_l_w_a_y_s _p_r_e_-
			 _c_e_d_e_s _t_h_e ``comments?'' _p_r_o_m_p_t  (see  -y
			 keyletter).

			 MRs in a list are  separated  by  blanks
			 and/or tab characters.  An unescaped new
			 line character terminates the MR list.

			 Note that if the v flag has a value (see
			 _a_d_m_i_n(1)), it is taken to be the name of
			 a program  (or  shell	procedure)  which
			 will  validate the correctness of the MR
			 numbers.  If a non-zero exit  status  is
			 returned  from MR number validation pro-
			 gram, _d_e_l_t_a terminates  (it  is  assumed
			 that the MR numbers were not all valid).

	  -y[_c_o_m_m_e_n_t]	 Arbitrary text used to describe the rea-
			 son for making the delta.  A null string
			 is considered a valid _c_o_m_m_e_n_t.

			 If -y is not specified and the  standard
			 input	is  a terminal, the prompt ``com-
			 ments?'' is issued on the standard  out-
			 put  before  the standard input is read;
			 if the standard input is not a terminal,
			 no  prompt  is issued.  An unescaped new
			 line character  terminates  the  comment
			 text.

	  -p		 Causes _d_e_l_t_a to print (on  the  standard
			 output) the SCCS file differences before
			 and after the	delta  is  applied  in	a
			 _d_i_f_f(1) format

FILES
     All files of the form ?-_f_i_l_e are  explained  in  the  _S_o_u_r_c_e
     _C_o_d_e _C_o_n_t_r_o_l _S_y_s_t_e_m _U_s_e_r'_s _G_u_i_d_e.	The naming convention for
     these files is also described there.

     g-file	      Existed  before  the  execution  of  _d_e_l_t_a;
		      removed after completion of _d_e_l_t_a.

     p-file	      Existed before the execution of _d_e_l_t_a;  may
		      exist after completion of _d_e_l_t_a.

     q-file	      Created  during  the  execution  of  _d_e_l_t_a;
		      removed after completion of _d_e_l_t_a.

     x-file	      Created  during  the  execution  of  _d_e_l_t_a;
		      renamed  to  SCCS  file after completion of
		      _d_e_l_t_a.

     z-file	      Created  during  the  execution  of  _d_e_l_t_a;
		      removed during the execution of _d_e_l_t_a.

     d-file	      Created  during  the  execution  of  _d_e_l_t_a;
		      removed after completion of _d_e_l_t_a.

     /usr/bin/bdiff   Program to compute differences between  the
		      ``gotten'' file and the _g-_f_i_l_e.

WARNINGS
     No lines beginning with an SOH ASCII character (binary  001)
     can  be  placed  in the SCCS file unless it is escaped.  The
     character has special meaning to SCCS (see _s_c_c_s_f_i_l_e(5))  and
     will cause an error.

     A _g_e_t of many SCCS files,	followed  by  a  _d_e_l_t_a	of  those
     files,  should  be  avoided  when	the _g_e_t generates a large
     amount  of  data.	 Instead,  multiple  _g_e_t/_d_e_l_t_a	sequences
     should be used.

     If the standard input (-) is specified on the _d_e_l_t_a  command
     line,  the  -m (if necessary) and -y keyletters _m_u_s_t also be
     present.  Omission of these keyletters causes  an	error  to
     occur.
