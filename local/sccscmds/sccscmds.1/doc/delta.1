.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Delta
is used to permanently introduce into
the named \*(S) file changes that were made to the file retrieved by
.IR get\^ (1)
(called the
.I g-file,
or generated file).
.PP
.I Delta
makes a delta to each named \*(S) file.
If a directory is named,
.I delta
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\*(S) files
(last component of the pathname does not begin with \fBs.\fR)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of \fB\(em\fR is given, the standard input is read
(see \*(W));
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \*(S) file
to be processed.
.PP
.I Delta
may issue prompts on the standard output depending upon
certain keyletters specified and flags
(see
.IR admin\^ (1))
that may be
present in the \*(S) file
(see
.B \(emm
and
.B \(emy
keyletters below).
.PP
Keyletter arguments
apply independently
to each named file.
.A2 r SID Uniquely
identifies which delta is to be made to the \*(S) file.
The use of this keyletter is necessary only if two or more
outstanding
.IR get\^ s
for editing (\fIget\fP
.B \(eme\c
)
on the same \*(S) file were done by the same person
(login name).
The \*(I) value specified with the
.B \(emr
keyletter can be either the \*(I) specified on the
.I get
command line or the \*(I) to be made as reported by the
.I get
command
(see
.IR get\^ ).
A diagnostic results if the specified \*(I) is ambiguous, or,
if necessary and omitted on the command line.
.AR s Suppresses
the issue, on the standard output, of the created delta's \*(I),
as well as the number of lines inserted, deleted and unchanged in the
\*(S) file.
.AR n Specifies retention of the edited
.I g-file
(normally removed at completion of delta processing).
.A2 g list Specifies
a \fIlist\fR (see
.IR get\^ (1)
for the definition of <\fIlist\fR>)
of deltas which are to be
.I ignored
when the file is accessed at the change level (\*(I))
created by this delta.
.A1 m mrlist If
the \*(S) file has the
.B v
flag set
(see
.IR admin\^ (1))
then a Modification Request (\*(M)) number \fImust\fR be
supplied as the reason for creating the new delta.
.C1 ~ If
.B \(emm
is not used and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
``\*(M)s?'' is issued on the standard output before the standard input
is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
\fIThe\fB ``\fR\s-1MR\s0s\fB?''\fI prompt always precedes the \fB``\fRcomments\fB?''\fI prompt\fR
(see
.B \(emy
keyletter).
.PP
.C1 ~ \*(M)s
in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab characters.
An unescaped new line character terminates the \*(M) list.
.C1 ~ Note
that if the
.B v
flag has a value
(see
.IR admin\^ (1)),
it is taken to be the name of a program (or shell procedure) which will validate
the correctness of the \*(M) numbers.
If a non-zero exit status is returned from \*(M) number validation program,
.I delta
terminates
(it is assumed that the \*(M) numbers were not all valid).
.A1 y comment Arbitrary
text
used to describe the reason for making the delta.
A null string is considered a valid \fIcomment\fR.
.C1 ~ If
.B \(emy
is not specified and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
\fB``\fRcomments\fB?''\fR is issued on the standard output before the standard
input is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no
prompt is issued.
An unescaped new line character terminates the comment text.
.AR p Causes
.I delta
to print (on the standard output) the \*(S) file
differences before and after the delta is applied
in a
.IR diff\^ (1)
format
.RE
.SH FILES
All files of the form
.I ?-file
are explained in the
\fISource Code Control System User's Guide\fP.
The naming convention for these files is also described there.
.RE
.TP "\w`/usr/bin/bdiff\ \ \ `u"

Program to compute differences

.PP
.SH WARNINGS
No lines beginning with an \s-1SOH ASCII\s0 character (binary 001)
can be placed in the \*(S) file unless it is escaped.
The character has special meaning to \*(S)
(see
.I sccsfile\c
(5)) and will cause an error.
.PP
A
.I get
of many \*(S) files,
followed by a
.I delta
of those files, should be avoided when the
.I get
generates a large amount of data.
Instead,
multiple
.I "get/delta"
sequences should be used.
.PP
If the standard input
(\fB\(em\fR)
is specified on the
.I delta
command line,
the
.B \(emm
(if necessary)
and
.B \(emy
keyletters
.I must
also be present.
Omission of these keyletters causes an error to occur.
