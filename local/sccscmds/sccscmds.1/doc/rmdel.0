NAME
     rmdel - remove a delta from an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     _r_m_d_e_l -rSID name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _R_m_d_e_l removes the delta specified by the SID from each named
     SCCS file.  The delta to be removed must be the newest (most
     recent) delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named
     SCCS  file.  In addition, the SID specified must _n_o_t be that
     of a version being edited for the purpose of making a  delta
     (i.  e.,  if a _p-_f_i_l_e (see _g_e_t(I)) exists for the named SCCS
     file, the SID specified must _n_o_t appear in any entry of  the
     _p-_f_i_l_e).

     If a directory is named, _r_m_d_e_l behaves as though  each  file
     in the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component of the pathname does not  be-
     gin  with	``s.''),  and  unreadable files, are silently ig-
     nored.  If a name of ``-'' is given, the standard	input  is
     read;  each  line	of  the standard input is taken to be the
     name of an SCCS  file  to	be  processed.	 Again,  non-SCCS
     files, and unreadable files, are silently ignored.

     The exact permissions necessary to remove a delta are  docu-
     mented  in  the _S_C_C_S/_P_W_B _U_s_e_r'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l.  Simply stated, they
     are either (1) if you make a delta you can remove it; or (2)
     if you own the file and directory you can remove a delta.

FILES
     x-file    (see _d_e_l_t_a(I))
     z-file    (see _d_e_l_t_a(I))
