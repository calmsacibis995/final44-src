NAME
     what - identify files

SYNOPSIS
     what file

DESCRIPTION
     _W_h_a_t searches the given files for	all  occurrences  of  the
     pattern  which  _g_e_t(1)  substitutes for %Z% (this is @(#) at
     this printing) and prints out what follows until  the  first
     ",  >, newline, \, or null character.  For example, if the C
     program in file f.c contains

	  char iden___[] "@(#)identification information";

     and f.c is compiled to yield f.o and a.out, then the command

	  _w_h_a_t f.c f.o a.out

     will print

	     f.c:

		  identification information

	     f.o:

		  identification information

	     a.out:

		  identification information

     _W_h_a_t is intended to be used in conjunction with the  command
     _g_e_t(1), which automatically inserts identifying information,
     but it can also be used where the	information  is  inserted
     manually.

SEE ALSO
     get(1), help(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Use _h_e_l_p(1) for explanations.

BUGS
     It's possible that an unintended occurrence of  the  pattern
     @(#)  could be found just by chance, but this causes no harm
     in nearly all cases.
