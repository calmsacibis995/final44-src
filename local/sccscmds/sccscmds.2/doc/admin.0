DESCRIPTION
     _A_d_m_i_n is used to create new SCCS files and change parameters
     of  existing  ones.  Arguments to _a_d_m_i_n, which may appear in
     any order, consist of keyletter arguments, which begin  with
     -,  and  named  files  (note that SCCS file names must begin
     with the characters s.).  If a named file doesn't exist,  it
     is  created, and its parameters are initialized according to
     the specified keyletter arguments.  Parameters not  initial-
     ized  by  a keyletter argument are assigned a default value.
     If a named file  does  exist,  parameters	corresponding  to
     specified keyletter arguments are changed, and other parame-
     ters are left as is.

     If a directory is named, _a_d_m_i_n behaves as though  each  file
     in the directory were specified as a named file, except that
     non-SCCS files (last component  of  the  pathname	does  not
     begin  with  s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.
     If a name of - is given, the standard input  is  read;  each
     line  of  the  standard  input is taken to be the name of an
     SCCS file	to  be	processed.   Again,  non-SCCS  files  and
     unreadable files are silently ignored.

     The keyletter arguments are as follows.  Each  is	explained
     as  though  only one named file is to be processed since the
     effects of the arguments apply independently to  each  named
     file.

	  -n		 This keyletter indicates that a new SCCS
			 file is to be created.

	  -i[_n_a_m_e]	 The _n_a_m_e of a file from which	the  text
			 for a new SCCS file is to be taken.  The
			 text constitutes the first delta of  the
			 file (see -r keyletter for delta number-
			 ing scheme).	If  the  i  keyletter  is
			 used,	but the file name is omitted, the
			 text is obtained by reading the standard
			 input	until  an  end-of-file is encoun-
			 tered.  If this  keyletter  is  omitted,
			 then  the  SCCS  file	is created empty.
			 Only one SCCS file may be created by  an
			 _a_d_m_i_n	command  on which the i keyletter
			 is supplied.  Using a	single	_a_d_m_i_n  to

			 create  two  or  more SCCS files require
			 that  they  be  created  empty  (no   -i
			 keyletter).   Note that the -i keyletter
			 implies the -n keyletter.

	  -r_r_e_l          The _r_e_lease into which the initial delta
			 is inserted.  This keyletter may be used
			 only if the -i keyletter is  also  used.
			 If  the  -r  keyletter  is not used, the
			 initial delta is inserted  into  release
			 1.   The  level  of the initial delta is
			 always 1 (by default initial deltas  are
			 named 1.1).

	  -t[_n_a_m_e]	 The _n_a_m_e of a file from  which  descrip-
			 tive  text  for  the  SCCS file is to be
			 taken.  If the -t keyletter is used  and
			 _a_d_m_i_n	is  creating a new SCCS file (the
			 -n and/or -i keyletters also used),  the
			 descriptive  text file name must also be
			 supplied.  In the case of existing  SCCS
			 files: (1) a -t keyletter without a file
			 name causes removal of descriptive  text
			 (if any) currently in the SCCS file, and
			 (2) a -t  keyletter  with  a  file  name
			 causes  text  (if any) in the named file
			 to replace the descriptive text (if any)
			 currently in the SCCS file.

	  -f_f_l_a_g	 This keyletter specifies  a  _f_l_a_g,  and,
			 possibly,  a  value  for the _f_l_a_g, to be
			 placed in  the  SCCS  file.   Several	f
			 keyletters  may  be supplied on a single
			 _a_d_m_i_n command line.  The allowable _f_l_a_gs
			 and their values are:

		  b	 Allows use of	the  -b  keyletter  on	a
			 _g_e_t(1) command to create branch deltas.

		  c_c_e_i_l  The highest release (i.e., ``ceiling''),
			 a  number  less  than	or equal to 9999,
			 which may be retrieved by a _g_e_t(1)  com-
			 mand for editing.  The default value for
			 an unspecified c flag is 9999.

		  f_f_l_o_o_r The lowest release (i.e., ``floor''),	a
			 number  greater  than	0  but	less than
			 9999, which may be retrieved by a _g_e_t(1)
			 command  for editing.	The default value
			 for an unspecified f flag is 1.

		  d_S_I_D	 The default delta  number  (SID)  to  be
			 used by a _g_e_t(1) command.

		  i	 Causes the "No id keywords  (ge6)"  mes-
			 sage  issued by _g_e_t(1) or _d_e_l_t_a(1) to be
			 treated  as  a  fatal	error.	 In   the
			 absence  of  this  flag,  the message is
			 only a warning.  The message  is  issued
			 if  no SCCS identification keywords (see
			 _g_e_t(1)) are found in the text	retrieved
			 or stored in the SCCS file.

		  j	 Allows concurrent  _g_e_t(1)  commands  for
			 editing on the same SID of an SCCS file.
			 This allows multiple concurrent  updates
			 to the same version of the SCCS file.

		  l_l_i_s_t  A _l_i_s_t of releases to which  deltas  can
			 no longer be made (_g_e_t -e against one of
			 these ``locked'' releases  fails).   The
			 _l_i_s_t has the following syntax:

			 <list> ::= <range> | <list> , <range>
			 <range> ::=	RELEASE NUMBER | a

			  The  character  a  in   the	_l_i_s_t   is
			 equivalent  to  specifying  _a_l_l _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_s
			 for the named SCCS file.

		  n	 Causes _d_e_l_t_a(1)  to  create  a  ``null''
			 delta in each of those releases (if any)
			 being skipped when a delta is made in	a
			 _n_e_w  release  (e.g., in making delta 5.1
			 after delta 2.7, releases 3  and  4  are
			 skipped).   These  null  deltas serve as
			 ``anchor points'' so that branch  deltas
			 may  later  be  created  from them.  The
			 absence  of  this  flag  causes  skipped
			 releases  to be non-existent in the SCCS
			 file preventing branch deltas from being
			 created from them in the future.

		  q_t_e_x_t  User definable text substituted for  all
			 occurrences  of  the %Q% keyword in SCCS
			 file text retrieved by _g_e_t(1).

		  m_m_o_d	 _M_o_dule name of the SCCS file substituted
			 for  all  occurrences of the %M% keyword
			 in SCCS file text retrieved  by  _g_e_t(1).
			 If  the  m  flag  is  not specified, the
			 value assigned is the name of	the  SCCS
			 file with the leading s. removed.

		  t_t_y_p_e  _T_y_p_e of module in the SCCS file  substi-
			 tuted for all occurrences of %Y% keyword
			 in SCCS file text retrieved by _g_e_t(1).

		  v[_p_g_m] Causes _d_e_l_t_a(1) to prompt for	Modifica-
			 tion  Request (MR) numbers as the reason
			 for  creating	a  delta.   The  optional
			 value specifies the name of an MR number
			 validity    checking	 program     (see
			 _d_e_l_t_a(1)).

	  -d_f_l_a_g	 Causes removal (deletion) of the  speci-
			 fied  _f_l_a_g  from  an  SCCS file.  The -d
			 keyletter may	be  specified  only  when
			 processing existing SCCS files.  Several
			 -d keyletters may be supplied on a  sin-
			 gle _a_d_m_i_n command.  See the -f keyletter
			 for allowable _f_l_a_g names.

		  l_l_i_s_t  A _l_i_s_t of releases to	be  ``unlocked''.
			 See  the  -f keyletter for a description
			 of the l flag and the syntax of a _l_i_s_t.

	  -a_l_o_g_i_n	 A _l_o_g_i_n name, or  numerical  UNIX  group
			 ID,  to  be  added  to the list of users
			 which may make deltas (changes)  to  the
			 SCCS  file.  A group ID is equivalent to
			 specifying all  _l_o_g_i_n	names  common  to
			 that group ID.  Several a keyletters may
			 be used on a single _a_d_m_i_n command  line.
			 As  many _l_o_g_i_ns, or numerical group IDs,
			 as desired may be on the list simultane-
			 ously.   If  the list of users is empty,
			 then anyone may add deltas.

	  -e_l_o_g_i_n	 A _l_o_g_i_n name, or numerical group ID,  to
			 be erased from the list of users allowed
			 to make deltas  (changes)  to	the  SCCS
			 file.	  Specifying   a   group   ID  is
			 equivalent to specifying all _l_o_g_i_n names
			 common  to  that  group  ID.	Several e
			 keyletters may be used on a single _a_d_m_i_n
			 command line.

	  -y[_c_o_m_m_e_n_t]	 The _c_o_m_m_e_n_t text is  inserted	into  the
			 SCCS  file  as a comment for the initial
			 delta in a manner identical to  that  of
			 _d_e_l_t_a(1).   Omission of the -y keyletter
			 results in a default comment line  being
			 inserted in the form:

			 date and time created YY/MM/DD  HH:MM:SS

			 by <logname>

			 The -y keyletter is valid only if the -i
			 and/or  -n  keyletters are specified (i.
			 e. a new SCCS file is being created).

	  -m[_m_r_l_i_s_t]	 The list of Modification  Requests  (MR)
			 numbers  is  inserted into the SCCS file
			 as the reason for creating  the  initial
			 delta in a manner identical to _d_e_l_t_a(1).
			 The v	flag  must  be	set  and  the  MR
			 numbers  are validated if the v flag has
			 a value (the name of an MR number  vali-
			 dation program).  Diagnostics will occur
			 if the v flag is not set or  MR  valida-
			 tion fails.

	  -h		 Causes _a_d_m_i_n to check the  structure  of
			 the  SCCS file (see _s_c_c_s_f_i_l_e(5)), and to
			 compare a newly computed check-sum  (the
			 sum  of  all  the characters in the SCCS
			 file except those  in	the  first  line)
			 with the check-sum that is stored in the
			 first line of the SCCS file.	Appropri-
			 ate error diagnostics are produced.

			 This keyletter inhibits writing  on  the
			 file, so that it nullifies the effect of
			 any other keyletters supplied,  and  is,
			 therefore, only meaningful when process-
			 ing existing files.

	  -z		 The SCCS file	check-sum  is  recomputed
			 and stored in the first line of the SCCS
			 file (see -h, above).

			 Note that use of  this  keyletter  on	a
			 truly	corrupted file may prevent future
			 detection of the corruption.

FILES
     The last component of all SCCS file names	must  be  of  the
     form ``s._f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e''.  New SCCS files are given mode 444 (see
     _c_h_m_o_d(1)).  Write permission in the pertinent directory  is,
     of  course,  required to create a file.  All writing done by
     _a_d_m_i_n is to a temporary x-file, called ``x._f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e'',  (see
     _g_e_t(1)),  created	with  mode  444  if  the _a_d_m_i_n command is
     creating a new SCCS file, or with the same mode as the  SCCS
     file if it exists.  After successful execution of _a_d_m_i_n, the
     SCCS file is removed (if  it  exists),  and  the  x-file  is
     renamed  with  the name of the SCCS file.	This ensures that
     changes are  made	to  the  SCCS  file  only  if  no  errors

     occurred.

     It is recommended that directories containing SCCS files  be
     mode  755	and  that SCCS files themselves be mode 444.  The
     mode of the directories allows only the owner to modify SCCS
     files  contained  in  the directories.  The mode of the SCCS
     files prevents any modification at all except by  SCCS  com-
     mands.

     If it should be necessary to patch an SCCS file for any rea-
     son,  the	mode  may be changed to 644 by the owner allowing
     use of _e_d(1).  _C_a_r_e _m_u_s_t _b_e _t_a_k_e_n!.  The edited file  should
     _a_l_w_a_y_s  be  processed by an _a_d_m_i_n -h to check for corruption
     followed by an _a_d_m_i_n -z  to  generate  a  proper  check-sum.
     Another  _a_d_m_i_n  -h is recommended to ensure the SCCS file is
     valid.

     _A_d_m_i_n also makes  use  of	a  transient  lock  file  (called
     ``z._f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e''),  which  is  used	to  prevent  simultaneous
     updates to the SCCS file by different users.  See _g_e_t(1) for
     further information.
