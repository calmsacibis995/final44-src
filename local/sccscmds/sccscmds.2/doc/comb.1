.th COMB SCCS 11/4/77
.sh NAME
comb \*- combine SCCS deltas
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd comb
.SF o
.SF s
.SP p sid ]
.SP c list]
name
.DT
.sh DESCRIPTION
.ad
.it Comb
generates a shell procedure (see
.it sh\c
(I))
which, when run, will reconstruct the given SCCS files.
The reconstructed files will, hopefully, be smaller than the original
files.
The arguments may be specified in any order,
but all keyletter arguments apply to all named SCCS files.
If a directory is named,
.it comb
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-SCCS files
(last component of the pathname does not begin with ``s\fB.\fP''),
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of ``\(em'' is given, the standard input is read;
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file
to be processed.
Again, non-SCCS files, and unreadable files are silently ignored.
.s1
The generated shell procedure is written on the standard output.
.s1
The keyletter
arguments are as follows.
Each is explained as though only one named file is to be processed,
but the effects of any keyletter argument apply independently
to each named file.
.AR p The
SCCS identification string (SID) of the oldest delta to be preserved.
All older deltas are discarded in the reconstructed file.
.AR c A
list
(see
.it get\c
(I)
for the syntax of a list)
of deltas to be preserved.
All other deltas are discarded.
.AR o This
argument causes the reconstructed file to be accessed at
the release of the delta to be created for each
``get \(eme'' generated.
Without this argument, the reconstructed file is accessed at
the most recent ancestor for each ``get \(eme'' generated.
Use of the
.bd o
keyletter may decrease the size of the reconstructed SCCS file.
It may also alter the shape of the delta tree of the original file.
.AR s This
argument causes
.it comb
to generate a shell procedure which, when run,
will
produce a report giving,
for each file,
the file name, size after combining, original size, and
percentage change
computed by:
.br
.ce 1
\%100~*~(original~\(em~combined)~/~original
.br
(Sizes are in blocks.)
We recommend that before any SCCS files are actually combined
one should use this option to determine exactly how much space
is saved by the combining process.
.i0
.s1
If no keyletter arguments are specified,
.it comb
will preserve only leaf deltas and the minimal number of ancestors
needed to preserve the tree.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Use
.it help\c
(I)
for explanations.
.sh BUGS
.it Comb
may rearrange the shape of the tree of deltas.
It may not save any space;
in fact, it is possible for the reconstructed file to
actually be larger than the original.
