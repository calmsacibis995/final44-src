NAME
     sccs - front end for the SCCS subsystem

SYNOPSIS
     sccs [ -r ] [ -d_p_a_t_h ] [ -p_p_a_t_h ] command [ flags ] [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_c_s is a front end to the SCCS programs that help them mesh
     more cleanly with the rest of UNIX.  It also includes the
     capability to run ``set user id'' to another user to provide
     additional protection.

     Basically, _s_c_c_s runs the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with the specified _f_l_a_g_s
     and _a_r_g_s. Each argument is normally modified to be prepended
     with ``SCCS/s.''.

     Flags to be interpreted by the _s_c_c_s program must be before
     the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument.  Flags to be passed to the actual SCCS
     program must come after the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument.  These flags
     are specific to the command and are discussed in the docu-
     mentation for that command.

     Besides the usual SCCS commands, several ``pseudo-commands''
     can be issued.  These are:

     edit      Equivalent to ``get -e''.

     delget    Perform a delta on the named files and then get
	       new versions.  The new versions will have id key-
	       words expanded, and will not be editable.  The -m,
	       -p, -r, -s, and -y flags will be passed to delta,
	       and the -b, -c, -e, -i, -k, -l, -s, and -x flags
	       will be passed to get.

     deledit   Equivalent to ``delget'' except that the ``get''
	       phase includes the ``-e'' flag.	This option is
	       useful for making a ``checkpoint'' of your current
	       editing phase.  The same flags will be passed to
	       delta as described above, and all the flags listed
	       for ``get'' above except -e and -k are passed to
	       ``edit''.

     create    Creates an SCCS file, taking the initial contents
	       from the file of the same name.	Any flags to
	       ``admin'' are accepted.	If the creation is suc-
	       cessful, the files are renamed with a comma on the
	       front.  These should be removed when you are con-
	       vinced that the SCCS files have been created suc-
	       cessfully.

     fix       Must be followed by a -r flag.  This command
	       essentially removes the named delta, but leaves

	       you with a copy of the delta with the changes that
	       were in it.  It is useful for fixing small com-
	       piler bugs, etc.  Since it doesn't leave audit
	       trails, it should be used carefully.

     clean     This routine removes everything from the current
	       directory that can be recreated from SCCS files.
	       It will not remove any files being edited.  If the
	       -b flag is given, branches are ignored in the
	       determination of whether they are being edited;
	       this is dangerous if you are keeping the branches
	       in the same directory.

     unedit    This is the opposite of an ``edit'' or a ``get
	       -e''.  It should be used with extreme caution,
	       since any changes you made since the get will be
	       irretrievably lost.

     info      Gives a listing of all files being edited.  If the
	       -b flag is given, branches (i.e., SID's with two
	       or fewer components) are ignored.  If the -u flag
	       is given (with an optional argument) then only
	       files being edited by you (or the named user) are
	       listed.

     check     Like ``info'' except that nothing is printed if
	       nothing is being edited, and a non-zero exit
	       status is returned if anything is being edited.
	       The intent is to have this included in an
	       ``install'' entry in a makefile to insure that
	       everything is included into the SCCS file before a
	       version is installed.

     tell      Gives a newline-separated list of the files being
	       edited on the standard output.  Takes the -b and
	       -u flags like ``info'' and ``check''.

     diffs     Gives a ``diff'' listing between the current ver-
	       sion of the program(s) you have out for editing
	       and the versions in SCCS format.  The -r, -c, -i,
	       -x, and -t flags are passed to _g_e_t; the -l, -s,
	       -e, -f, -h, and -b options are passed to _d_i_f_f. The
	       -C flag is passed to _d_i_f_f as -c.

     print     This command prints out verbose information about
	       the named files.

     The -r flag runs _s_c_c_s as the real user rather than as what-
     ever effective user _s_c_c_s is ``set user id'' to.  The -d flag
     gives a root directory for the SCCS files.  The default is
     the current directory.  The -p flag defines the pathname of
     the directory in which the SCCS files will be found;

SCCS(LOCAL)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      SCCS(LOCAL)



     ``SCCS'' is the default.  The -p flag differs from the -d
     flag in that the -d argument is prepended to the entire
     pathname and the -p argument is inserted before the final
     component of the pathname.  For example, ``sccs -d/x -py get
     a/b'' will convert to ``get /x/a/y/s.b''.	The intent here
     is to create aliases such as ``alias syssccs sccs
     -d/usr/src'' which will be used as ``syssccs get
     cmd/who.c''.  Also, if the environment variable PROJECT is
     set, its value is used to determine the -d flag. If it
     begins with a slash, it is taken directly; otherwise, the
     home directory of a user of that name is examined for a sub-
     directory ``src'' or ``source''.  If such a directory is
     found, it is used.

     Certain commands (such as _a_d_m_i_n) cannot be run ``set user
     id'' by all users, since this would allow anyone to change
     the authorizations.  These commands are always run as the
     real user.

EXAMPLES
     To get a file for editing, edit it, and produce a new delta:

	  sccs get -e file.c
	  ex file.c
	  sccs delta file.c

     To get a file from another directory:

	  sccs -p/usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c

     or

	  sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c

     To make a delta of a large number of files in the current
     directory:

	  sccs delta *.c

     To get a list of files being edited that are not on
     branches:

	  sccs info -b

     To delta everything being edited by you:

	  sccs delta `sccs tell -u`

     In a makefile, to get source files from an SCCS file if it
     does not already exist:

BUGS
     It should be able to take directory arguments on pseudo-
     commands like the SCCS commands do.

DISCLAIMER
     Since it is not yet clear what this program should do, it
     should not be considered a stable program product.  Please
