NAME
     comb - combine SCCS deltas

SYNOPSIS
     _c_o_m_b [-o] [-s] [-psid] [-clist] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     _C_o_m_b generates a shell procedure  (see  _s_h(I))  which,  when
     run,  will  reconstruct  the  given  SCCS files.  The recon-
     structed files will, hopefully, be smaller than the original
     files.  The arguments may be specified in any order, but all
     keyletter arguments apply to all named  SCCS  files.   If	a
     directory	is named, _c_o_m_b behaves as though each file in the
     directory were specified as a named file, except  that  non-
     SCCS  files  (last  component of the pathname does not begin
     with ``s.''), and unreadable files are silently ignored.  If
     a	name  of ``-'' is given, the standard input is read; each
     line of the standard input is taken to be	the  name  of  an
     SCCS  file  to be processed.  Again, non-SCCS files, and un-
     readable files are silently ignored.

     The generated shell procedure is  written	on  the  standard
     output.

     The keyletter arguments are as follows.  Each  is	explained
     as  though  only  one named file is to be processed, but the
     effects of any keyletter  argument  apply	independently  to
     each named file.

	  -p   The SCCS identification string (SID) of the oldest
	       delta  to be preserved.	All older deltas are dis-
	       carded in the reconstructed file.

	  -c   A list (see _g_e_t(I) for the syntax of  a	list)  of
	       deltas to be preserved.	All other deltas are dis-
	       carded.

	  -o   This argument causes the reconstructed file to  be
	       accessed at the release of the delta to be created
	       for each ``get -e'' generated.  Without this argu-
	       ment,  the  reconstructed  file is accessed at the
	       most recent ancestor for each ``get -e''  generat-
	       ed.   Use of the _o keyletter may decrease the size
	       of the reconstructed SCCS file.	It may also alter
	       the shape of the delta tree of the original file.

	  -s   This argument causes _c_o_m_b to generate a shell pro-
	       cedure which, when run, will produce a report giv-
	       ing, for each file, the file name, size after com-
	       bining,	original size, and percentage change com-
	       puted by:
		     100 * (original - combined) / original
	       (Sizes are in blocks.) We  recommend  that  before
	       any  SCCS  files  are actually combined one should
	       use this option	to  determine  exactly	how  much

	       space is saved by the combining process.

     If no keyletter arguments are specified, _c_o_m_b will  preserve
     only  leaf deltas and the minimal number of ancestors needed
     to preserve the tree.

FILES
     s.COMB	   The name of the reconstructed SCCS file.
     comb?????	   Temporary.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Use _h_e_l_p(I) for explanations.

BUGS
     _C_o_m_b may rearrange the shape of the tree of deltas.  It  may
     not  save	any space; in fact, it is possible for the recon-
     structed file to actually be larger than the original.
