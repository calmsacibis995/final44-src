NAME
     prt - print SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     prt [-d] [-s] [-a] [-i] [-u] [-f] [-t] [-b] [-e] [-y[SID]]
     [-c[cutoff]] [-r[rev-cutoff]] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _P_r_t prints part or all of an SCCS file in a  useful  format.
     If  a directory is named, _p_r_t behaves as though each file in
     the directory were specified as a named  file,  except  that
     non-SCCS  files  (last  component	of  the pathname does not
     begin with s.) and unreadable files  are  silently  ignored.
     If  a  name  of - is given, the standard input is read; each
     line of the standard input is taken to be	the  name  of  an
     SCCS  file  to  be  processed.   Again,  non-SCCS	files and
     unreadable files are silently ignored.

     The keyletter arguments are as follows.  Each  is	explained
     as  though  only  one named file is to be processed, but the
     effects of any keyletter  argument  apply	independently  to
     each named file.

	  -d		 This  keyletter  normally   causes   the
			 printing of delta table entries of the D
			 type.

	  -s		 Causes only the first line of the  delta
			 table	entries  to  be printed; that is,
			 only  up  to	the   statistics.    This
			 keyletter  is	effective  only  if the d
			 keyletter   is   also	 specified    (or
			 assumed).

	  -a		 Causes those types  of  deltas  normally
			 not  printed  by  the	d keyletter to be
			 printed. These are  types  R  (removed).
			 This  keyletter is effective only if the
			 d  keyletter  is  also   specified   (or
			 assumed).

	  -i		 Causes  the  printing	of   the   serial
			 numbers   of	those	deltas	included,
			 excluded, and ignored.   This	keyletter
			 is  effective only if the d keyletter is
			 also specified (or assumed).

     The following format is used to print those portions of  the
     SCCS  file as specified by the above keyletters.  The print-
     ing of each delta table entry is preceded by a newline char-
     acter.

	       a)  Type of delta (D or R).

	       b)  Space.

	       c)  SCCS identification string (SID).

	       d)  Tab.

	       e)  Date and time of creation.
		   (in the form YY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS)

	       f)  Tab.

	       g)  Creator.

	       h)  Tab.

	       i)  Serial number.

	       j)  Tab.

	       k)  Predecessor delta's serial number.

	       1)  Tab.

	       m)  Statistics.
		   (in the form inserted/deleted/unchanged)

	       n)  Newline.

	       o)  ``Included:_t_a_b'', followed by SID's of  deltas
		   included,  followed	by newline (only if there
		   were any such deltas and if	i  keyletter  was
		   supplied).

	       p)  ``Excluded:_t_a_b'', followed by SID's of  deltas
		   excluded,   followed   by  newline  (see  note
		   above).

	       q)  ``Ignored:_t_a_b'', followed by SID's  of  deltas
		   ignored, followed by newline (see note above).

	       r)  ``MRs:_t_a_b'', followed by MR numbers related to
		   the delta, followed by newline (only if any MR
		   numbers were supplied).

	       s)  Lines of comments (delta commentary), followed
		   by newline (if any were supplied).

	  -u		 Causes the printing of  the  login-names
			 and/or  numerical  group  IDs	of  those
			 users allowed to make deltas.

	  -f		 Causes the printing of the flags of  the
			 named file.

	  -t		 Causes the printing of  the  descriptive
			 text contained in the file.

	  -b		 Causes the printing of the body  of  the
			 SCCS file.

	  -e		 This keyletter implies the d, i,  u,  f,
			 and  t  keyletters  and  is provided for
			 convenience.

	  -y[_S_I_D]	 This keyletter will cause  the  printing
			 of  the delta table entries to stop when
			 the delta just printed has the specified
			 SID.	If  no delta in the table has the
			 specified  SID,  the  entire  table   is
			 printed.   If	no  SID is specified, the
			 first	delta  in  the	delta  table   is
			 printed.   This keyletter will cause the
			 entire delta table entry for each  delta
			 to be printed as a single line (the new-
			 lines in the normal multi-line format of
			 the  d keyletter are replaced by blanks)
			 preceded by the name of  the  SCCS  file
			 being	processed,  followed by a :, fol-
			 lowed	by  a  tab.   This  keyletter  is
			 effective  only  if  the  d keyletter is
			 also specified (or assumed).

	  -c[_c_u_t_o_f_f]	 This keyletter will cause  the  printing
			 of  the  delta  table entries to stop if
			 the delta about to be printed	is  older
			 than the specified cutoff date-time (see
			 _g_e_t(1) for the format of date-time).  If
			 no date-time is supplied, the epoch 0000
			 GMT Jan. 1, 1970 is used.  As with the y
			 keyletter, this keyletter will cause the
			 entire delta table entry to  be  printed
			 as  a	single line and to be preceded by
			 the name of the  SCCS	file  being  pro-
			 cessed,  followed  by a :, followed by a
			 tab.  This keyletter is  effective  only
			 if the d keyletter is also specified (or
			 assumed).

	  -r[_r_e_v-_c_u_t_o_f_f] This keyletter will cause  the  printing
			 of the delta table entries to begin when
			 the delta about to be printed	is  older
			 than  or  equal  to the specified cutoff
			 date-time (see _g_e_t(1) for the format  of

			 date-time).   If  no  date-time  is sup-
			 plied, the epoch 0000 GMT Jan.  1,  1970
			 is used.  (In this case, nothing will be
			 printed).  As with the y keyletter, this
			 keyletter  will  cause  the entire delta
			 table entry to be printed  as	a  single
			 line  and  to be preceded by the name of
			 the SCCS file being processed,  followed
			 by   a  :,  followed  by  a  tab.   This
			 keyletter is effective  only  if  the	d
			 keyletter    is   also   specified   (or
			 assumed).

     If any keyletter but y, c, or r is supplied, the name of the
     file  being  processed (preceded by one newline and followed
     by two newlines) is printed before its contents.

     If none of the u , f , t , or b keyletters is supplied,  the
     d keyletter is assumed.

     Note that the s and i keyletters, and the c and r keyletters
     are mutually exclusive; therefore, they may not be specified
     together on the same _p_r_t command.

     The form of the delta table as produced by the y, c,  and	r
     keyletters  makes	it  easy to sort multiple delta tables by
     time order.  For example, the following will print the delta
     tables  of all SCCS files in directory _s_c_c_s in _r_e_verse chro-
     nological order:

	 prt  -c  sccs	|  grep  .  |  sort  '-rt<tab>'  +2  -3

     When both the y and c or the y and  r  keyletters	are  sup-
     plied, _p_r_t will stop printing when the first of the two con-
     ditions is met.

     The _r_e_f_o_r_m(1) command can be used to truncate long lines.

     See _a_d_m_i_n(1), _s_c_c_s_f_i_l_e(5), and _S_o_u_r_c_e  _C_o_d_e  _C_o_n_t_r_o_l  _S_y_s_t_e_m
     _U_s_e_r'_s  _G_u_i_d_e  for more information about the meaning of the
     output of _p_r_t.
