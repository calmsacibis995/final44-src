NAME
     sccsdiff - compare two versions of an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
     _s_c_c_s_d_i_f_f old-spec new-spec [ pr-args ] sccsfile ...

DESCRIPTION
     _S_c_c_s_d_i_f_f compares two versions of an SCCS file and generates
     the  differences  between the two versions.  The _o_l_d-_s_p_e_c is
     any valid _g_e_t(I) specifier (e.g., -r1.1) for the old version
     to  be  gotten.   Similarly,  _n_e_w-_s_p_e_c  is  any valid _g_e_t(I)
     specifier (e.g., -r1.4) for the new version  to  be  gotten.
     The _p_r-_a_r_g_s are any valid _p_r(I) arguments which begin with a
     ``-'', except for ``-h'' (the output of  _s_c_c_s_d_i_f_f	is  piped
     through  _p_r(I)).  Any number of SCCS files may be specified,
     but the _o_l_d-_s_p_e_c and _n_e_w-_s_p_e_c apply to all files.

     _S_c_c_s_d_i_f_f is a simple  shell  procedure;  interested  persons
     should ``cat /usr/bin/sccsdiff'' to discover how it works.

FILES
     /tmp/get?????     temporary for old gotten version
     /usr/bin/bdiff    program that generates differences
