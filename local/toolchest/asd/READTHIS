If you are planning to build "asd" on an AT&T 3B2 computer then
a few things are recommended.

First, find the variable "char *hextab" in the file asd.h and change
it to "extern char *hextab" before compiling.

Second, edit the Makefile and change
	BIN=/usr/lbin/asd
to whatever you really want the directory of commands to reside.

Third, the rest of the hardcoded pathnames are arguments of "execl" commands.
The following is a grep of "execl" from the source code:

asdrcv.c:	execl ("/bin/mail", "mail", user, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:	execl ("/usr/bin/mail", "mail", user, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:*	execl ("/bin/unseal", "unseal", "-K", keyfile, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:*	execl ("/usr/bin/unseal", "unseal", "-K", keyfile, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:*	execl ("/bin/inspkg", "inspkg", (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:*	execl ("/usr/bin/inspkg", "inspkg", (char *) 0);
crypt.c:	execl("/usr/lib/makekey", "-", 0);
crypt.c:	execl("/lib/makekey", "-", 0);
mkdir.c:	execl ("/bin/mkdir", "mkdir", d, 0);
mkdir.c:	execl ("/bin/rmdir", "rmdir", d, 0);

The *'ed lines are the ones that might give you trouble.  We recommend that
you change the lines as follows.

asdrcv.c:	execlp ("unseal", "-K", keyfile, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:	execlp ("unseal", "-K", keyfile, (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:	execlp ("inspkg", (char *) 0);
asdrcv.c:	execlp ("inspkg", (char *) 0);
