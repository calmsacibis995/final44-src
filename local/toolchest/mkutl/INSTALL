  As you've probably noticed, this Toolchest product has been delivered
  in two directories, "src" with source code, and "fmt" or "unfmt" for
  formated or unformated documentation.  This file outlines the steps
  needed to install the product on an AT&T 3B20 computer running UNIX(r)
  System V (release 2).  Installation on other machines may differ and
  is the responsiblity of the installer to reconcile.


Product:
	make-util - make file utilities to generate and
	analyze "make" scripts.

Prerequisites:
	None, other than ATT UNIX System V, known.

To make the source:
	Begin by unbundling the source files, execute:
		sh make-util.b

	Execute:
		make

	and wait a while.

To create the documentation:
	The documents, if requested in nroff format, can be created
	by issuing the following commands:
		nroff -man makefile.man | col >makefile.M
		nroff -man mkxref.1     | col >mkxref.M
		nroff -man nlorder.man  | col >nlorder.M
		nroff -man shorten.man  | col >shorten.M
