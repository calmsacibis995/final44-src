	  nnnnlllloooorrrrddddeeeerrrr is a slightly	reworked version of _l_o_r_d_e_r(_1) .	It
	  resolves references to BSS (uninitialized storage) and does
	  not repeat any object	file name pairs.

	  The input is one or more object or library archive _f_i_l_e_s
	  (see _a_r(1)).	The standard output is a list of pairs of
	  object file names, meaning that the first file of the	pair
	  refers to external identifiers defined in the	second.	 The
	  output may be	processed by _t_s_o_r_t(1) to find an ordering of a
	  library suitable for one-pass	access by _l_d(1).  Note that
	  the link editor (except on the PDP -11) _l_d(1)	is capable of
	  multiple passes over an archive in the portable archive
	  format (see _a_r(4)) and does not require that _n_l_o_r_d_e_r(1) be
	  used when building an	archive.  The usage of the _n_l_o_r_d_e_r(1)
	  command may, however,	allow for a slightly more efficient
	  access of the	archive	during the link	edit process.

	  The following	example	builds a new library from existing ....oooo
	  files.

	       ar cr library `nlorder *.o | tsort`

	  Object files whose names do not end with ....oooo, even when
	  contained in library archives, are overlooked.  Their	global
	  symbols and references are attributed	to some	other file.
