     SShhoorrtteenn reads the given _f_i_l_e, writes to the standard output, and folds all
     lines that	are longer than	_e_n_d characters at the last blank from _f_o_l_d to
     _e_n_d.  If there are	no blanks from _f_o_l_d to _e_n_d on the line,	the line is
     folded after _e_n_d.

     If	the _t_r_a_i_l_e_r-_s_t_r_i_n_g is specified, it is appended	to the line after the
     fold point	and before the new-line.  The length of	the _t_r_a_i_l_e_r-_s_t_r_i_n_g is
     not included in the calculation of	the fold point.

     The portion of the	line after _e_n_d is preceded by _i_n_d_e_n_t blanks on the next
     line or the specified _i_n_d_e_n_t-_s_t_r_i_n_g.

     If	no files are given then	default	is the standard	input.	The flag
     defaults are:  _f_o_l_d = 60, _e_n_d = 80, _i_n_d_e_n_t	= 0.

     Invalid arguments are quietly ignored.

     SShhoorrtteenn understands about backspaces and standard UNIX1 tabs.

BBUUGGSS
     The difference _e_n_d	- _f_o_l_d must be less than 256.
