December 1, 1987 ----

Version 1.1 of the toolchest awk makes some changes:

(1) The programs from the book were inadvertently omitted
from the original distribution.  They are now present, as
c[1-7].progs.

(2) Some yacc's will not handle the grammar in awk.g.y;
they have a too-small table.  It is conceivable that some
version of lex will have a similar problem.  The files
	sv.y.tab.c sv.y.tab.h sv.lex.yy.c
are the output of our yacc and lex;  if your yacc or lex
fails, copy them to y.tab.c, y.tab.h, and lex.yy.c and modify
the makefile to bypass the yacc or lex steps as explained in
INSTALL.

(3) Some C compilers apply a strict scope rule to extern
declarations within functions.  Two extern declarations in
lib.c and tran.c have been moved to obviate this problem.
