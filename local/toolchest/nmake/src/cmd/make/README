This is the roadmap for the fourth generation make.

The files are distributed as follows from the bootstrap archive:

	$ROOT/
		MAKE
		bin/
			nmake*
			mkcv*
			mkold*
		etc/
			[generation scripts]
		include/
			default.h*
			directory.h
			generic.h*
			hash.h
		lib/
			Makerules.mo*
			cpp*
			default.h*
			libx.a*
			mkcv1*
			mkcv2*
			mkold2*
		src/
			cmd/
				cpp/
					[source]
				make/
					README
					RELEASE
					[source]
					examples/
						[examples]
				mkcv/
					[source]
				mkold/
					[source]
			lib/
				libx/
					[source]

The files marked * are created by the installation procedure.
The directories are created if needed.

To bootstrap nmake from the archive "MAKE.cpio" or "MAKE.tar":

	(1)	make a new directory and cd to it
	(2)	execute "cpio -icdvm < MAKE.cpio" or "tar xvf MAKE.tar"
	(3)	execute "MAKE" to do the installation

To install nmake and the associated components in the directories
LOCALBIN, LOCALLIB, LOCALINCLUDE and LOCALMAN:

	(1)	execute "ROOT=*directory from (1) above*"
	(2)	execute "export ROOT"
	(3)	execute "cd $ROOT/src/cmd/make"
	(4)	execute "$ROOT/bin/nmake local \
			LOCALBIN=? LOCALLIB=? LOCALINCLUDE=? LOCALMAN=?"
