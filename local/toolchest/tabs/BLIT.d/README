This directory contains support programs for running EMACS (BTL and
CMU), vi, and Tabs on a Blit.  The file FILES.list contains a file by
file explanation for each file.  The file netty.c is Blit 68000 or DMD
source for use in a Blit layer.  To use netty:

	1. Change the embedded pathnames in load_netty.c.

	2. run "$ make" in this directory.

	3. copy the files from the directory "n" to your local terminfo
	  directory.

"whip_config" is a configuration file for layers.  whip_layers.sh will
run the configuration layers using the configuration file.

BTL EMACS 4.6 Users

	1. copy netty.emacs.ti to your emacs terminals directory.  The
	   file should be called "netty".  Link or copy the file to
	   "netty-vi" and "netty-vi-new", too.

	2. copy the file blit.mac.newer to your emacs macros directory.

	3. add the following line to the bottom of your
	   $HOME/.emacs_init file:

	   	^X^L/usr/lib/emacs/macros/blit.mac.newer

	   The name of the macro directory should be used in place of
	   "/usr/lib/emacs/macros" above.

	4. download netty.m with the load_netty program.  This will set
	   your terminal type to "netty".


VI users

	1. copy the file ex_voper.c to /usr/src/cmd/vi/vax.  Go to
	   /usr/src/cmd/vi and run the shell file makevi to recompile
	   vi.  This adds a command (^X^_) for moving to a specific row
	   and column.

	2. download netty.m with the load_netty program.  Use the -v
	   option.  This will set your terminal type to "netty-vi".

	3. set your terminal type to netty-vi-new if you want to sweep
	   as well as point with vi and netty AND you have completed
	   step 1 above.


CMU EMACS Users

	1. add blit.pad.ml to the bottom of your $HOME/.emacs_pro file. 
	   If you don't have an .emacs_pro you might try copying the file
	   emacs_pro.ml to $HOME/.emacs_pro.

	2. download netty.m with the load_netty program.  This will set
	   your terminal type to "netty".

Yes, It is designed to work with emacs - the default (non-netty) action
sends a miserable escape sequence.  You can reprogram it to clear locally
(i.e. doesn't send anything back to UNIX) with the following:

	echo "\033FI!##\014!"
		or
	send_netty -f clear "##\014"

or the following will work fairly well in both the shell and emacs

	echo "\033FI!\014\@\010!"
		or
	send_netty -f clear "\014\@\010"

This last one assumes that you are using "@" as your line kill character
and ^h (011) as your erase character.
