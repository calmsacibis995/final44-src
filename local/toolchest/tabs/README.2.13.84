========= Change user_mask to fndfv for CMKEY_LIST fields and Match Menus

CMKEY_LIST now returns the the kval (associated index) in fndfv.  It
used to use user_mask.  User mask and user_pointer are now used only by
application programs.

New_Match_menu now also uses fndfv instead of user_mask.


========= CMKEY_LIST keyword lists no longer have to be sorted!

CMKEY_LIST now sorts the first 128 keywords.  Keyword lists of over 128
should be sorted by the application.  Lists of over 128 are probably
created automatically, so this should not be much of a problem.


========= New_Match_Menu Changes

The New_Match_Menu() stuff has been greatly expanded.  It now uses only
one window for all popup menus.  You can also specify that the menu
popup only after an arbitrary delay.  This makes this sort of menu good
for expert users, too.  Read the entry in the Tabs manual for full
details.

========= Optimizations

This version of Tabs has a bunch of performnace tweeks.  Window movement
is much faster.  Show_Default_Field() has also been tunded up a bit.
