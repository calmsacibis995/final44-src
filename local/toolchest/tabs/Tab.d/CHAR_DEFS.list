I changed the following control character directives:

		Was				Is

	^P (push error messages)	^C (clear error messages)
	^B (BACK TAB)			^P (previous field)
	^F (forward TAB or field)	^N (next field)
	^L (last line)			^O (overlay erased characters)
	^R (refresh the display)	^V (Verify by refreshing the display)
	^X (left in the field)		^L (left in the field)
	^C (right in the field)		^R (right in the field)
	^Q (beginning of field)		^B (beginning of field)

These changes were brought about primarily because of the new insert and
delete features.  Movement within the field was patched in with the
temporary, very poor choices (^X, ^C, and ^Q).  Ken Hicks suggested
that we use ^O (for overlay) and free up ^L (for left).  This makes more
sense within the line and does a better job of explaining what the
overlay feature is all about. The overlay command implements a very
simple form of overlay (rather than insert) style editing.

The following is the default interpretation of the control keys:

 ^@ -- A null also BREAK and interrupts - erase the field
 ^A -- HOME
 ^B -- Beginning of field
 ^C -- Clear the messages
 ^D
 ^E -- End of field
 ^F
 ^G -- Down
 ^H
 ^I -- Tab
 ^J -- Line Feed (nl)
 ^K
 ^L -- Left in the field
 ^M -- Carriage Return
 ^N -- Next field - FTABC forward tab
 ^O -- Overlay the last line
 ^P -- Previous field - BTABC back tab
 ^Q
 ^R -- Right in the field
 ^S
 ^T -- Left
 ^U
 ^V -- Verify the display by refreshing
 ^W -- Delete word
 ^X
 ^Y -- Right
 ^Z -- Bottom
 ^[ -- Escape
 ^\
 ^]
 ^^ -- Up
 ^_ -- IF CORRECT dump screen
 Space -- the punctuation character - the atom and word separator
 ? -- Help

The keys ^^, ^T, ^Y, and ^G are pretty good for arrow key substitutes. 
They form a triangle on most keyboards.

			^^ (UP)
		^T (LEFT)	^Y (RIGHT)
			^G (DOWN)

The other arrow key or cursor pad substitutes are ^A for HOME and ^Z for
BOTTOM.  ^A is above ^Z on the keyboard.

The cursor pad keys are all physically related on the keyboard, like hjkl
for vi.

The rest of the keys are mostly pneumonically related.  ^R for right, ^L
for left, etc.
