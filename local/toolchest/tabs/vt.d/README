This directory contains code for constructing a very general purpose
virtual terminal.  This virtual terminal code orginated in Warren
Montgomery's compact implementation of EMACS.  The code has been greatly
rehacked to include visual attributes, some improved optimization, and a
host of nit picking touches.

The virtual terminal may be used with all three of the common terminal
databases found on UNIX(TM) - BTL EMACS, termcap, and terminfo.  See the
makefile for switching databases.  The default database is terminfo.

The file sttype.c contains terminal dependent code that gets around
problems in terminfo and the other terminal databases.
