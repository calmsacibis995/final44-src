This directory contains te code for producing the 3D windows used by
Tabs.  The code in this directory may be used directly by loading
libwindows.a and ../vt.d/vt.a.

The files box.c and wsttype.c contain terminal dependent code that gets
around problems in terminfo and the other terminal databases.  wsttype.c
is almost identical to ../vt.d/sttype.c.  The two files differ mainly in
the allocation of some central structures.
