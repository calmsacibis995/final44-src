# this is a shell script that get's "sourced" when building and
# installing TranScript software.  It sets up definitions of the
# places that TranScript wants to do it's work.
# This script is concerned with the software itself, not with
# the printers.  Another script (???) is used to configure printers.
#
# If you change the values in this script, parts of the TranScript
# system may need to be remade (recompiled), and reinstalled.

# BINDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript user programs are put.
#	It should be in the PATH of each user that want's to use them.
#	Many UNIX sites will keep these kinds of programs separate
#	from the regular UNIX utilites but in a well-known spot, like
#	"/usr/local/bin", "/usr/local", etc.  Whatever you choose,
#	make sure it's in people's search paths.  The TranScript
#	installation sequence will write in this directory.

# BANNERFIRST BANNERLAST
#	These determine the default actions to take with job banner pages.

#	These flags may be set on a per-printer basis, so you don't need

#	Indicates that verbose job logging should take place in the
