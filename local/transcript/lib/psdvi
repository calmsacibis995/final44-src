#  psdf - dvi filter for LaserWrite printers driven with
#  TranScript software.  Note that this is not the top-level
#  filter, it is called by the psdf filter which is directly
#  referenced by the :df= capability in /etc/termcap.
#
#  The work is done by the program dvi2ps, which is expected
#  to be installed in /usr/local, or this filter will fail.
