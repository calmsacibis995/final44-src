.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.I dumplabel
allows initial labelling of tapes to be used for file system dumps by the
.IR dump (8)
program.
If the 
.B f
switch is given, the following argument is used as the device which
is to be used for labelling (default /dev/rmt8).
The
.B r
switch rewinds the tape and puts the tape offline after each label is made.
These optional arguments may be followed by one or more tape label specificiations.
If none specifications
are present, the tape is opened, the header read and the label printed.
.PP
The label specification is similar in style to the arguments for the dump program.
The 
.B l
argument gives the label stem, with an optional `%s' being used to show
the position in the string which is replaced by the variable section
given by the remaining program arguments.
For example
.IP
dumplabel -l TA%s 000,100-103,aaa,NAA-NAC
.PP
will generate TA000, TA100, TA101, TA102, TA103, TAaaa, TANAA, TANAB and TANAC.
If the
.B l
switch is omitted, then the label is taken from the program argument.
This means that
.IP
dumplabel -l sources
.PP
is equivalent to
.IP
dumplabel sources
.PP
Labels are limited to 15 characters.
