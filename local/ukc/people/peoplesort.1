.SH NAME
peoplesort \- Sort private user name database
.SH SYNOPIS
.B peoplesort
[
.B \-f
file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Peoplesort
is used to re-order the private user name database accessed by
the programs defined in the
.IR people (1)
command.
.LP
The datafile is usually stored in a file `.people' on the users home
directory.
The
.B \-f
switch can be used to access other databases, alternatively
another location may be selected by supplying an environment variable
.IP
PEOPLE=
.LP
where the value of the variable gives the name of the file
containing the people database.
.LP
The program reads the entire user database, sorts it using the `*name'
field as a key and prints it on standard output.
Please beware that
.IP
peoplesort > .people
.LP
will fail horribly.
An intermediate file is required, or the use of the
.IR over (1)
command, as in
.IP
over .people peoplesort
.LP
The program knows about the convention used to construct normal `*name'
lines, sorting is first done on the surname, conventionally, the last
token in the `*name' line and then on the remainder of the line starting
at the beginning.

.SH BUGS
There should be some way to specify alternative sort keys.
