This directory contains Sun 3 and VAX binraries for some of the Kent
software tools.

The files below here are:
	
	usr/sunbin/{xvdiff,xfs,xvf,xguide,xrtp,xups}:
		Binaries of the tools for X windows (X10) on the Sun 3.

	usr/vaxbin/{xvdiff,xfs,xvf,xguide}
		X binaries of the tools for the VAX.  These were built
		on a GPX under Ultrix, but should run under 4.2BSD
		(I don't know about 4.3).
	
	usr/sunbin/{svdiff,sfs,svf,sguide,srtp,sups,sups.real}:
		Binaries of the same tools to run under sunview on the Sun 3.
		sups is a shell script which runs sups.real in a shelltool
		window.
	
	usr/man/manl/{*.l,README.ups}
		Manual pages for the tools.  Ups does not currently have
		a manual page - there is a brief description in README.ups
	
	usr/lib/rtp usr/bin/rtp{cc,f77}
		Support files for rtp - see the manual page.
		You will need a symbolic link from /usr/local/lib/rtp
		to the rtp library directory.

	usr/lib/guide
		Directory containing library files needed by sguide and xguide.
		If you want to run guide without installing the library
		in /usr/lib/guide, set GUIDELIB in the environment to
		the name of the directory.

Fs runs vf and vdiff - it looks for them in the directories in the PATH
environment variable.

fs, vf, vdiff and guide have all been in use for a reasonable time and
are fairly stable.  Development has only recently stopped on rtp.
ups is still very much under development, so expect bugs.

If you have problems, mail mtr@uk.ac.ukc
