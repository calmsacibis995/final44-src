----- GUIDE FILES -----

This directory contains some public GUIDE learning files and demonstration files, plus man and etc subdirectories.


--- THE man SUBDIRECTORY ---

The man subdirectory is used if it is desired to keep a cache of manual pages
that have been converted to GUIDE format.  This subdirectory itself has subdirectories
corresponding to the Sections of the manual (e.g. cache1, cache2, etc.).  To
create these cache subdirectories the `makecaches' shell script in the etc
subdirectory (see below) can be run.  (For subsequent fine tuning, if only
certain Sections of the manual pages are to be cached, the unwanted cache
directories can be deleted.  For example cache3 could be deleted in it was not
required to keep a cache of Section 3.)


--- THE etc SUBDIRECTORY ---

The etc subdirectory contains miscellaneous files that GUIDE needs or that may
be valuable to GUIDE users.  These are as follows:

+	fonts.  On the SUN these have names such as ggacha.b.16.

+	files for converting manual pages to GUIDE format.  These are the shell
	script moption.script and its subsidiary file moption.macros.  They are
	invoked by GUIDE when the -m option is used.

+	utilities that convert GUIDE files to roff format.  These are not used
	by GUIDE itself; instead they are for direct use by GUIDE
	users.  The lpall utility converts to a form where all the GUIDE
	structure (enquiries, buttons, etc.) can be seen.  An example of its
	use is
	
		lpall myguidefile | troff
		
	The lplowest utility is similar but does not show any structure -- just
	the underlying text.  The files lpall.macros and lplowest.macros, as
	their names imply, are used by these utilities.   Note that these
	utilities do not do a perfect layout job, particularly when tabs are
	involved, but nevertheless they have been found very valuable.

+	the makecaches script for creating caches.
