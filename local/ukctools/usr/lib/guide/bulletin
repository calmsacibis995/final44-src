MassComp sets sights on DEC's European customer base

claims that its range of 32-bit UNIX-based systems, which include the MC-500, will

design and engineering, real-time data acquisition, graphics processing and program

Lorrin Gale, vice president of engineering for MassComp said of the company's main

competitor, Digital Equipment, which holds a 25% world market share, "The UK is DEC'
.Gu
s biggest subsidiary outside of the US. Ken Olsen has already said that he wants the 
.Gu
UK company to grow from a $5,000 million to a $10,000 million company. But the scientific 
.Gu
and technical area isn't worth that much so DEC will soon be forced to expand in to 
.Gu
other areas leaving a gap which MassComp hopes to fill."

MassComp UK will sell direct to end-users and has signed up one OEM. Looking forward,
.Gu
 Gale plans to set up a European production facility within the next five years. MassComp
