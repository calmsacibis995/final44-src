Introduction

Modifications have been made to the
standard VAX
.UX
debugger
.I adb
to simplify
examination of post-mortem
dumps automatically generated following a system crash.
These changes may also be used when examining
.UX
in its normal operation.
This document serves as
an introduction to the

of these facilities, and
should not be construed as a description
of \fIhow to debug the kernel\fP.

.FE
.NH 2
Establishing Context
.PP
During initialization
.I adb
attempts to establish the
context of the ``currently active process'' by examining
the value of the kernel variable \fImasterpaddr\fP.
This variable contains the virtual address of the 
process context block of the last process which
was set executing by the \fISwtch\fP routine.
\fIMasterpaddr\fP normally provides sufficient information
to locate the current stack frame (via the stack
pointers found in the context block).
D 3
By locating the VAX process context block for the
process,
E 3

By locating the process context block for the process

.I adb
may then perform virtual to
physical address translation using that process's
in-core page tables.
.PP
When examining post-mortem dumps locating the
D 3
most recent stack frame of the
``currently active process'' is nontrivial.
This is due to the different ways in which the
VAX may save state after a nonrecoverable error. 
E 3
I 3
most recent stack frame of the last
currently active process can be nontrivial.
This is due to the different ways in which
state may be saved after a nonrecoverable error. 
E 3
Crashes may or may not be ``clean'' (i.e.
D 3
the top of the interrupt stack contains the process's
E 3
I 3
the top of the interrupt stack contains a pointer
to the process's
E 3
kernel mode stack pointer and program counter);
an ``unclean'' crash will occur, for instance,
D 3
if the interrupt stack overflows.
Thus, one must manually try one of two possible techniques
to get a stack trace from a post-mortem dump.  If the
crash was clean the current stack pointer is present in the
restart parameter block, at \fIscb\-4\fP (or \fIrpb\fP+1fc),
and the command
.sp 1
.ti +5
*(\fBscb\fP\-4)$c
.sp 1
will generate a stack trace all the way from the kernel
E 3
I 3
if the interrupt stack overflows.  When
.I adb
is invoked on a post-mortem crash dump it tries
to automatically establish the proper stack frame.
This is done by first checking the stack pointer
normally saved in the restart parameter
D 4
block at \fIscb\-4\fP (or \fIrpb\fP+1fc).  If this
E 4
I 4
block at \fIrpb\fP+1fc (or \fIscb\fP\-4).  If this
E 4
value does not point to a valid stack frame,
.I adb
searches the interrupt stack looking for a valid stack
frame.  Should this also fail 
.I adb
then searches the kernel
stack located in the user structure associated with
the last executing process.  If
.I adb
is able to locate a valid stack frame using this procedure
the command
.DS
D 5
\f(CW$c\fP
E 5
I 5
.cw
$c
.pw
E 5
.DE
will generate a stack trace from the last point at which
the kernel was executing on behalf of the user process
all the way
E 3
to the top of the user process's stack (e.g. to the
D 3
\fImain\fP routine in the user process which was running).
Otherwise, one must scan through the interrupt stack
looking for the stack frame.  This is usually indicated
by a zero longword entry (the procedure call handler)
followed by a longword entry with bit 29 set (indicating
the call frame was generated as a result of a ``calls''
instruction).

Should
.I adb
be unable to locate a valid stack frame it prints a message
and the current state is left undefined.
When a stack trace of a particular process (other than that
which was currently executing) is desired, an
D 4
alternate method, described in \(sc2.3, should be used.

``proc'' and ``text'' are scripts used to format the obvious

script has been broken into a number of lines for convenience
here; in actuality it is a single line of text).

The first line displays the pointers associated with the doubly
linked list used in managing text segments.
The second line produces the list of disk block addresses associated
E 3
with a swapped out text segment.  The ``n'' format forces a new-line
character, with 12 hexadecimal integers printed immediately after.
Likewise, the remaining two lines of the command format the remainder
of the text structure.  The expression ``16t'' causes
.I adb
to tab
to the next column which is a multiple of 16.  
The last two plus operators are present
to round ``.'' to the end of the text structure.  This allows the
user to reinvoke the format on consecutive text structures without
having to be concerned about proper alignment of ``.''.
.PP
The majority of the scripts provided are of this nature.
When possible, the formatting scripts print a data structure
with a single format to allow subsequent reuse when interrogating
arrays of structures.  That is, the previous script could have
been written

Locating stack frames
.PP
It is frequently desirable to locate stack frames
in order to examine local and register variables.
In particular, frames created by a trap include saved values
of all registers and the trap context, and all registers are saved
upon a panic as well.
Two scripts are provided for tracing stack frames.
The first is capable of tracing through multiple frames,
printing the information common to each.
The second prints all of the information available
in the stack frame after a trap.
The following example illustrates their use.

The example shows a panic due to a segmentation fault.
The command ``1000$s'' expands the range over which addresses will be
displayed symbolically.
The back trace indicates that the trap occurred four frames
from the end;

E 6
I 6
as the frame pointer is stored at \fIrpb\fP+1fc, the command
E 6
``*(rpb+1fc),4$<frame'' prints the last four stack frames;
``*(rpb+1fc)'' is the initial frame pointer, and the count determines the number
of frames to print.
Having located the stack frame after the trap (the frame with a return PC
of Xtransflt+1d), that frame may be displayed again using the script
for a trap frame.
The previous frame pointer was left in register 1 by the previous script,
and thus ``<1$<trapframe'' displays the state at the time of the trap.
The PC at the time of the fault is shown on the last line from the script,
with the faulting address listed as the code in the previous line.
The instruction that caused the fault can then be examined.
In this example, the instruction was a remque that used a displacement
addressing mode indirecting through R1.
The location to which the register points is the first of the process
run queues, and its first element can be seen to be corrupted;
its forward pointer, 2a50b6ca, is invalid and is the address that caused
the fault.

Traversing Data Structures

The
.I adb
command language can be used to traverse complex data
D 3
structures.  One such data structure, a linked list, occurs
E 3
I 3
structures.  One data structure, a linked list, occurs
E 3
quite often in the kernel.  By using
.I adb
variables and the
normal expression operators it is a simple matter to construct
D 3
a script which chains down the list printing each element
E 3

a script which chains down a list printing each element

For instance, the queue of processes awaiting timer events,
the callout queue, is printed with the following two scripts:

The first line of the script \fBcallout\fP starts the traversal
at the global symbol
\fIcalltodo\fP and prints a set of headings.
It then skips the empty portion of the structure used
as the head of the queue.
The second line then invokes the script \fBcallout.next\fP
moving ``.'' to
the top of the queue (``*+'' performs the indirection
through the link entry of the structure at the head of the queue).
.PP
\fBcallout.next\fP prints values for each column, then performs
a conditional test on the link to the next entry.  This test
is performed as follows,
.IP "*+>l" 9
Place the value of the ``link'' in the
.I adb
variable ``<l''.
.IP ",#<l$<"
If the value stored in ``<l'' is non-zero, then the current
input stream (i.e. the script \fBcallout.next\fP) is terminated.
Otherwise, the expression ``#<l'' will be zero, and the ``$<''
will be ignored.  That is, the combination of the logical negation
D 3
operator ``#'',
E 3
I 3
operator ``#'', the
E 3
.I adb
D 3
variable ``<l'', and ``$<'' operator
E 3
I 3
variable ``<l'', and the ``$<'' operator
E 3
creates a statement of the form,

The remaining line of \fBcallout.next\fP simply reapplies the

and the base of the array of process structures in ``<f''.
\fBsetproc.nxt\fP then performs a linear search through the
array until it matches the process-id requested, or until
it runs out of process structures to check.  The script

.PP
The extensions made to
.I adb
provide basic support for debugging the
.UX
kernel by eliminating the need for a user to carry
D 3
out virtual to physical address translation.  A collection
of scripts have been written to nicely format the major
E 3
I 3
out virtual to physical address translation and by automatically
locating the stack frame after a system crash.  A collection
of scripts have been written to format the major
E 3
kernel data structures and aid in switching between
D 3
process contexts.  This has been carried out with
only minimal changes to the debugger.
.PP
More work is needed to provide enough information
for the debugger to automatically establish context
after a system crash.  The system currently does not
always save enough state to allow the debugger to reliably
locate the stack frame just prior to an exception.
.PP
More work is also required on the user interface
to \fIadb\fP.  It appears the inscrutable
E 3
I 3
process contexts.  These facilities have been implemented with
only minimal changes to the debugger.  While the symbolic debugger
.I dbx
provides facilities similar to those described here it is
not yet a viable alternative to
E 3
.I adb
D 3
command language
has limited widespread use of much of the power of
\fIadb\fP.  One possibility is to provide a more comprehensible
``adb frontend'', just as \fIbc\fP(1) is used to
frontend \fIdc\fP(1).
.PP
Finally,
.I adb
could be significantly improved if it
were knowledgeable about a program's data structures.
This would eliminate the use of numeric offsets into
C structures.
E 3
I 3
because
.I dbx
takes too long to read in the symbol table.  As soon as
this problem is corrected there will be only limited need for
the facilities provided by \fIadb\fP.
