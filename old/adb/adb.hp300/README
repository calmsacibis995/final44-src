This is a version of adb(1) that runs on the HP 68K, from Mike Hibler of
the Systems Programming Group of the University of Utah Computer Science
Department.  The SCCS id's are, presumably, the SCCS ids of the files
that he started with.  The SCCS files for this version of adb can be found
in ../adb.vax/SCCS.
