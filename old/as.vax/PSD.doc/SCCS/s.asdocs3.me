As soon as the assembler sees this directive,
it ignores all further input
(but it does read to the end of file),
and aborts the assembly.
No files are created.
It is anticipated that this would be used in a pipe interconnected
version of a compiler,
where the first major syntax error would
cause the compiler to issue this directive,
saving unnecessary work in assembling code
that would have to be discarded anyway.

These two pseudo-operations cause the

subsegment.
If specified,
the

must be defined and absolute;
an omitted

is treated as zero.
The effect of a

directive is treated
as a

directive if the
.b \-R
assembly flag is set.
Assembly starts in the
.b ".text"
0 subsegment.

The location counter is adjusted
so that the
.i expression
lowest bits of the location counter become zero.
This is done by
assembling from 0 to $2 sup align\*(USexpr$ bytes,
taken from the low order byte of $fill\*(USexpr$.
If present,
$fill\*(USexpr$ must be absolute;
otherwise it defaults to 0.
Thus
.q ".align 2"
pads by null bytes to make the location counter
evenly divisible by 4.
The
.i align_expr
must be defined,
absolute, nonnegative,
and less than 16.

the subsegment concatenation convention
and the current loader conventions
may not preserve attempts at aligning
to more than 2 low-order zero bits.

A

is a

.i tab le
entry.
The
.b .stabs
is a string stab, the
.b .stabn
is a stab not having a string,
and the
.b .stabd
is a 
.q dot
stab that implicitly references
.q dot ,
the current location counter.
D 3
Note:
The old
.b .stab
directive is no longer supported because it assumes a
fixed length for the string in a
.b .stabs
directive.
E 3
.pp
The
.i string
in the
.b .stabs
directive is the name of a symbol.
If the symbol name is zero,
the
.b .stabn
directive may be used instead.
.pp
The other expressions are stored
in the name list structure
of the symbol table
and preserved by the loader for reference by
.i sdb ;
the value of the expressions are peculiar to formats required by
.i sdb .

.ip $expr sub 1$
is used as a symbol table tag
(nlist field
.i n\*(UStype ).
.ip $expr sub 2$
seems to always be zero
(nlist field
.i n\*(USother ).
.ip $expr sub 3$
is used for either the
source line number,
or for a nesting level
(nlist field
.i n\*(USdesc ).
.ip $expr sub 4$
is used as tag specific information
(nlist field
.i n\*(USvalue ).
In the
case of the
.b .stabd
D 6
directive, this expression is nonexistant, and
E 6
I 6
directive, this expression is nonexistent, and
E 6
is taken to be the value of the location counter
at the following instruction.
Since there is no associated name for a
.b .stabd
directive,
it can
only be used in circumstances where the name is zero.
The effect of a
.b .stabd
directive can be achieved by one of the other
.b .stab x
directives in the following manner:
.br
$bold .stabn$ $expr sub 1$, $expr sub 2$, $expr sub 3$, $roman LL n$
.br
$roman LL n bold :$
.pp
The
.b .stabd
D 6
directive is prefered,
E 6
I 6
directive is preferred,
E 6
because it does not clog the symbol
table with labels used only for the stab symbol entries.
