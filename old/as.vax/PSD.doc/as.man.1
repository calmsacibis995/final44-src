.SH DESCRIPTION
.I As
assembles the named files, or the standard input if no file name is specified.
The available flags are:
.TP
.B \-d
Specifies the number of bytes to be assembled for offsets
which involve forward or external references, and which have sizes unspecified
in the assembly language.
The default is 
.B \-d4.
.TP
.B \-L
Save defined labels beginning with a `L', which are normally discarded
to save space in the resultant symbol table.
The compilers generate such temporary labels.
.TP
.B \-V
Use virtual memory for some intermediate storage,
rather than a temporary file.
.TP
.B \-W
Do not complain about errors.
.TP
.B \-J
Use long branches to resolve jumps when byte-displacement branches are
insufficient.  This must be used when a compiler-generated assembly contains
branches of more than 32k bytes.
.TP
.B \-R
Make initialized data segments read-only, by concatenating them to
the text segments.
This obviates the need to run editor scripts on assembly
code to make initialized data read-only and shared.
.TP
.B \-t
Specifies a directory to receive the temporary file, other than
the default /tmp.
.PP
All undefined symbols in the assembly
are treated as global.
.PP
The output of the assembly is left on the file
.I objfile;
if that is omitted,
.I a.out
is used.
.SH FILES
.ta 1.5i
/tmp/as\(**	default temporary files

a.out		default resultant object file
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH BUGS
.B \-J
should be eliminated; the assembler should automatically choose among
byte, word and long branches.
