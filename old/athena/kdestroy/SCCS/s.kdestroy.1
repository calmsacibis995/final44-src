.SH DESCRIPTION
The

Kerberos
D 2
authorization tickets by writing zeros to the file that contains them.
If the ticket file does not exist,
E 2
I 2
authorization tickets.
If no tickets currently exist for the user,

After overwriting the file,
.I kdestroy
removes the file from the system.
E 2
The utility
displays a message indicating the success or failure of the
operation.
If
.I kdestroy
D 2
is unable to destroy the ticket file,
E 2
I 2
is unable to destroy the tickets,
E 2
the utility will warn you by making your terminal beep.
.PP
D 2
In the Athena workstation environment,
the
.I toehold
service automatically destroys your tickets when you
end a workstation session.
If your site does not provide a similar ticket-destroying mechanism,
you can place the
E 2
I 2
You can place the
E 2
.I kdestroy
command in your
.I .logout
file so that your tickets are destroyed automatically
when you logout.
.PP

.I kdestroy
are as follows:
.TP 7
.B \-f
.I kdestroy

.SH BUGS
.PP
Only the tickets in the user's current ticket file are destroyed.
Separate ticket files are used to hold root instance and password
changing tickets.  These files should probably be destroyed too, or
all of a user's tickets kept in a single ticket file.
