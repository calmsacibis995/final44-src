.SH NAME
kpasswd \- change a user's Kerberos password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kpasswd
[
.B \-h
] [
.B \-u 
.I username
] [
.B \-i
.I instance
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I kpasswd
command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.
.PP
If the
.I \-h
option is specified, a brief summary of the options is printed, and 
.I kpasswd
then exits.
.PP
If the
.I \-u
option is specified, 
.I username
is used as the principal name, rather than the username of the user
running
.IR kpasswd .
.PP
If the
.I \-i
option is specified,
.I instance
is used as the instance, rather than a null instance.
.PP

The utility prompts for the current Kerberos password (printing
the name of the principal for which it intends to change the password),
which is verified by the Kerberos server.  If the old password is
correct, the user is prompted twice for the new password.  A message is
printed indicating the success or failure of the password changing
operation.

.SH SEE ALSO
kerberos(1), kinit(1), passwd(1)
.SH BUGS
.I kpasswd
should take the default name and instance from the current ticket file
rather than by using the Unix username.
