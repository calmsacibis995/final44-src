.SH NAME
netcp \- remote copy of files through the net
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netcp
[
.B \-l
login ] [
.B \-p
password ]
[
.B \-f
] [
.B \-n
] [
.B \-q
] fromfile tofile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Netcp
copies files between machines and is similar to
.IR cp (\*o).
At least one of
.I fromfile
and
.I tofile
must be remote.
The
.B \-l,
.B \-p,
.B \-f,
.B \-q,
and
.B \-n
behave exactly as in
.IR net (\*s).
.PP
.I Fromfile
and
.I tofile
follow these conventions:
.TP 4
1.
A simple filename is assumed to be local and from the current directory.
.TP 4
2.
A filename preceded by a machine designator (see below)
is a reference to a file on the specified remote machine.
If a full pathname is not given, it is assumed to be from the login directory.
.PP
Examples:
.IP "    grades.p" 20
file in the current directory on local machine
.IP "    C:junk" 20
file in your login directory on C
.IP "    /usr/lib/pq" 20
file on local machine
.IP "    C:comp/c2.c" 20
file in a subdirectory on C machine
.PP
When files are being ``fetched'', that is, the
.I fromfile
is remote and the 
.I tofile
is local, the
.I tofile
is created zero-length mode 600.
For security reasons, when the ``fetched'' file's contents
arrive at the local machine, the file must still be zero-length
and mode 0600.
No confirmation is sent to the user that the file has been ``fetched'';
a non-zero file length indicates completion.
.PP
.I Netcp
executes the
.IR net (\*s) 
command.

.SH BUGS
The second filename may not be defaulted to a directory name as in
.IR cp (\*o),
it must be given explicitly.
.br
The file mode may or may not be set correctly.
