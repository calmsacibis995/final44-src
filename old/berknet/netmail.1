.SH DESCRIPTION
Mail is checked and/or read on the specified
.I machine.
If the machine specification is omitted, the default machine is used.
The command has two distinct modes depending on whether the 
.B \-c
option is specified.
.PP
If 
.B \-c
is specified, the presence of mail is checked on the remote machine.
No password is required so it can be put in C shell `.netrc' file.
A message is written or mailed back (see 
.IR net (\*s))
if there is or is not any unread mail.
.PP
If the 
.B \-c
option is not specified, mail is read and mailed back to the user.
A password is required.
Mail is also appended to the remote file
.I `mbox'
as a precaution.
.PP
The 
.B \-q 
option suppresses the message sent back if there is no mail.
The options
.B \-l,
.B \-p,
.B \-f,
and
.B \-n
behave exactly as in
.IR net (\*s).
(The login name can be specified either with the
.B \-l
option or by `machine:username'.)
.PP
.I Netmail
executes the
.IR net (\*s)
command.
.PP
Examples:
.IP "    netmail\ \-c\ X:uname" 30
checks if there is mail for `uname' on the X machine, no password required.
.IP "    netmail\ X:uname" 30
reads mail for `uname' on the X machine, mails it back, password is required.
