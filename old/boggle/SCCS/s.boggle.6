.PP
The object of Boggle is to find, within 3
minutes, as many words as possible in a 4 by 4 grid of letters. Words
may be formed from any sequence of 3 or more adjacent letters in the
grid. The letters may join horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
However, no position in the grid may be used more than once within any
one word. In competitive play amongst humans, each player is given
credit for those of his words which no other player has found.
.PP
In interactive play, enter your words separated by spaces, tabs,
or newlines. A bell will ring when there is 2:00, 1:00, 0:10, 0:02,
0:01, and 0:00 time left. You may complete any word started before the
expiration of time. You can surrender before time is up by hitting
\&'break'. While entering words, your erase character is only effective
within the current word and your line kill character is ignored.
.PP
Advanced players may wish to invoke the program with 1 or 2 +'s as
the first argument. The first + removes the restriction that positions
can only be used once in each word. The second + causes a position to
be considered adjacent to itself as well as its (up to) 8 neighbors.
