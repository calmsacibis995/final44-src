The object of Boggle (TM Parker Bros.) is to find, within 3 minutes, as
many words as possible in a 4 by 4 grid of letters.
Words may be formed from any sequence of 3 or more adjacent letters
in the grid.  The letters may join horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally.  However, no position in the grid may be used
more than once within any one word.
In competitive play amongst humans, each player is given
credit for those of his words which no other player has found.
.ti +5
This program is intended for people
wishing to sharpen their skills at Boggle.
If you invoke the program with 4 arguments of 4 letters each,
(e.g. "boggle appl epie moth erhd")
the program forms the obvious Boggle grid and lists all the
words from /usr/dict/words found therein.
If you invoke the program without arguments, it will generate
a board for you, let you enter words for 3 minutes, and then
tell you how well you did relative to /usr/dict/words.
.ti +5
In interactive play, enter your words separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines.
A bell will ring when there is 2:00, 1:00, 0:10, 0:02, 0:01, and 0:00 time
left.
You may complete any word started before the expiration of time.
You can surrender before time is up by hitting 'break'.
While entering words, your erase character is only effective within the current

Advanced players may wish to invoke the program with 1 or 2 +'s as the
first argument.  The first + removes the restriction that postions can only
be used once in each word.
The second + causes a position to be considered adjacent to itself
as well as its (up to) 8 neighbors.
Hit any key to begin.
