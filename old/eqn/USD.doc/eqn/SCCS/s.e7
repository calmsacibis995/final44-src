Conclusions
.PP
We think we have shown that it is possible
to do acceptably good typesetting of mathematics
on a phototypesetter,
with an input language that is easy to learn and use and
that satisfies many users' demands.
Such a package can be implemented in
short order,
given a compiler-compiler and
a decent typesetting program underneath.
.PP
Defining a language, and building a compiler for it
with a compiler-compiler
seems like the only sensible way to do business.
Our experience with the use of
a grammar and a compiler-compiler has been
uniformly favorable.
If we had written everything into code directly,
we would have been locked into
our original design.
Furthermore, we would have never been sure
where the exceptions and special cases were.
But because we have a grammar, we can change our minds readily and still be reasonably
sure that if a construction works in one place
it will work everywhere.
