If any of the files
.IR localhosts ,
.IR localnetworks ,
or
.I localgateways
are present in the current directory,
the file's contents is prepended to the
output file.
Of these, only the gateways file is interpreted.
This allows sites to maintain local aliases and
entries which are not normally present in the
master database.
Only one gateway to each network will be placed in the gateways file;
a gateway listed in the localgateways file will override any in the
input file.

E 7
these networks will be treated as ``local,''
and information about hosts on local networks is
taken only from the localhosts file.
Entries for local hosts from the main database will be omitted.
This allows the localhosts file to completely override
any entries in the input file.
