.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Implogd
is program which logs error messages from an

Entries in the file are variable length.  Each log
entry has a fixed length header of the form:

};

followed, possibly, by the message received from the 
IMP.  Each time the logging process is started up it
places a time stamp entry in the file (a header with

The logging process will catch only those message from
the IMP which are not processed by a protocol module,
e.g. IP.  This implies the log should contain only
D 3
status information such as ``IMP going down'' messages

The messages should probably be sent to the system error
logging process instead of maintaining yet another log file.
