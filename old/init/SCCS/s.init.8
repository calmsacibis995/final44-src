.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm init
program
is the last stage of the boot process.
It normally runs the automatic reboot sequence as described in
.Xr reboot 8 ,
E 6
and if this succeeds, begins multi-user operation.
If the reboot fails, it commences single user operation by giving
D 6
the super-user a shell on the console.  It is possible to pass parameters
E 6
I 6
the super-user a shell on the console.
The
.Nm init
program
may be passed parameters
E 6
from the boot program to
D 6
.I init
so that single user operation is commenced immediately.
When such single user operation is terminated by killing the single-user
shell (i.e. by hitting ^D),
.I init
runs
.I /etc/rc
without the reboot parameter.
This command file
performs housekeeping operations
such as removing temporary files,
mounting file systems, and starting
daemons.
.PP
E 6
I 6
prevent the system from going multi-user and to instead execute
a single user shell with out starting the normal daemons.
The system is then quiescent for maintenance work and may
later be made it go multi-user by killing the
the single-user shell (with ^D).
This
causes
.Nm init
to run the
.Pa /etc/rc
start up command file without the reboot parameter.
.Pp
E 6
In multi-user operation, 
D 6
.I init's
role is to create a process for each
terminal port on which a user may log in.
To begin such operations, it reads the file
.I /etc/ttys
E 6
I 6
.Nm init
maintains
processes for the terminal ports found in the file
.Xr ttys 5.
.Nm Init
reads this file, and executes the command found in the second field.
This command is usually
.Xr getty 8 ;
.Xr getty
opens and initializes the tty line
E 6
and
D 3
forks several times to create a process
for each terminal specified in the file.
Each of these processes opens the appropriate terminal
for reading and writing.  These channels thus
receive file descriptors 0, 1 and 2, the standard input and
output and the diagnostic output.
Opening the terminal will usually involve a delay,
since the
.IR open ""
is not completed until someone
is dialed up and carrier established on the channel.
If a terminal exists but an error occurs when trying to open the terminal
.I init
complains by writing a message to the system console;
the message is repeated every 10 minutes for each such terminal
until the terminal is shut off in /etc/ttys and init notified (by
a hangup, as described below), or the terminal becomes accessible
(init checks again every minute).
After an open succeeds,
.I /etc/getty
is called with argument as specified by the second character of
the
.I ttys
file line.
E 3
I 3
D 6
executes a command for each terminal specified in the file.
This command will usually be
D 5
.IR /etc/getty .
E 5
I 5
.IR /usr/libexec/getty .
E 5
E 3
.I Getty
I 4
opens and initializes the terminal line,
E 4
reads the user's name and invokes
.I login
to log in the user and execute the Shell.
.PP
Ultimately the Shell will terminate
because of an end-of-file either
typed explicitly or generated as a result of hanging up.
The main path of
.IR init ,
which has been waiting
for such an event,
wakes up and removes the appropriate entry from the
file
.IR utmp ,
which records current users, and
makes an entry in
D 5
.IR /usr/adm/wtmp ,
E 5
I 5
.IR /var/log/wtmp ,
E 5
which maintains a history
of logins and logouts.
E 6
I 6
executes the
.Xr login
program.
E 6
The
D 6
.I wtmp
entry is made only if a user logged in successfully on the line.
Then the appropriate terminal is reopened and
.I getty
is
reinvoked.
.PP
.I Init
catches the
.I hangup
signal (signal SIGHUP) and interprets it to mean that
the file
.I /etc/ttys
should be read again.
The Shell process on each line which used to be active
in
.I ttys
but is no longer there is terminated;
a new process is created for each added line;
lines unchanged in the file are undisturbed.

I 4
Thus it is possible to drop or add terminal lines without
E 4
rebooting the system by changing the
.I ttys
file and sending a
.I hangup
signal to the
.I init
process: use `kill \-HUP 1.'
.PP
.I Init
E 6
I 6
.Xr login
program, when a valid user logs in,
exectutes a shell for that user.  When this shell
dies, either because the user logged out
or an abnormal termination occured (a signal),
the
.Nm init
program wakes up, deletes the user
from the
.Xr utmp 5
file of current users and records the logout in the
.Xr wtmp
file.
The cycle is
then restarted by
.Nm init
excuting a new
.Xr getty
for the line.
.Pp
Lines may be added or deleted from the
.Xr ttys
file without a reboot by sending the signal
.Dv SIGHUP
to
.Nm init
with the command
.Dq Li "kill -HUP 1"
Upon receipt of this signal,
.Nm init
re-reads the
.Xr ttys
file.
Engaged (in use) ports
are not disturbed,
and if an engaged port has been deleted from the
file, it will only become inactive after the engaging process has
terminated (the user has logged off).
If a port is inactive (only a
.Xr getty
or terminated processes are attached to it)
.Nm init
elimiates these processes.
For these ports and any new ports, for which a command is found
in the
.Xr ttys
file,
.Nm init
executes a new
.Xr getty .
.Pp
.Nm Init
E 6
will terminate multi-user operations and resume single-user mode
D 6
if sent a terminate (TERM) signal, i.e. ``kill \-TERM 1''.
E 6
I 6
if sent a terminate
.Pq Dv TERM
signal, for example,
.Dq Li "kill \-TERM 1" .
E 6
If there are processes outstanding which are deadlocked (due to
hardware or software failure),
D 6
.I init
E 6
I 6
.Xr init
E 6
will not wait for them all to die (which might take forever), but
will time out after 30 seconds and print a warning message.
D 6
.PP
.I Init
E 6
I 6
.Pp
.Nm Init
E 6
will cease creating new
D 6
.IR getty 's
and allow the system to slowly die away, if it is sent a terminal stop (TSTP)
signal, i.e. ``kill \-TSTP 1''.  A later hangup will resume full
E 6
I 6
.Xr getty Ns 's
and allow the system to slowly die away, if it is sent a terminal stop
.Pq Dv TSTP
signal, i.e.
.Dq Li "kill \-TSTP 1" .
A later hangup will resume full
E 6
multi-user operations, or a terminate will initiate a single user shell.
This hook is used by
D 6

I 6
.Xr reboot 8
E 6
and

.IR halt (8).

If, at bootstrap time, the
