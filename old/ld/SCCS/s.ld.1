references, and searches libraries.
In the simplest case several object

are given, and
D 5

combines them, producing
an object module which can be either executed or
become the input for a further

E 5
run.
(In the latter case, the
D 5
.B \-r
E 5
I 5

option must be given
D 5

The argument routines are concatenated in the order
specified.  The entry point of the output is the
D 5

If any argument is a library, it is searched exactly once
at the point it is encountered in the argument list.
Only those routines defining an unresolved external
reference are loaded.
If a routine from a library
references another routine in the library,
and the library has not been processed by
D 5
.IR ranlib (1),
E 5
I 5
.Xr ranlib  1  ,
E 5
the referenced routine must appear after the
referencing routine in the library.
Thus the order of programs within libraries
may be important.
The first member of a library
should be a file named `\_\^\_.SYMDEF',
which is understood to be a dictionary for the library as produced by
D 5
.IR ranlib (1);
E 5
I 5
.Xr ranlib  1  ;
E 5
the dictionary is searched iteratively to satisfy as many references as
possible.
D 5
.PP
E 5
I 5
.Pp
E 5
The symbols `\_etext', `\_edata' and `\_end'
(`etext', `edata' and `end' in C)
are reserved, and if referred to,
are set to the first location above the program,
the first location above initialized data,
and the first location above all data respectively.
It is erroneous to define these symbols.

This option specifies incremental loading, i.e.
linking is to be done in a manner so that the resulting object
may be read into an already executing program.
The next argument is the name of a file whose symbol table will be
taken as a basis on which to define additional symbols.
Only newly linked material will be entered into the text and
D 5
data portions of 
.BR a.out,
E 5
I 5
data portions of
.Xr a.out ,
E 5
but the new symbol table will reflect
every symbol defined before and after the incremental load.
This argument must appear before any other object file in the argument list.
The
D 5
.B \-T
E 5
I 5
.Fl T
E 5
option may be used as well, and will be taken to mean that the
newly linked segment will commence at the corresponding address
(which must be a multiple of 1024).
The default value is the old value of _end.
