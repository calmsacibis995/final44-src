The second file contains all data and

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All functions that return an

indicate errors with negative values.
A zero return indicates ok.

D 2
The
`.pag'
file will contain holes so
that its apparent size is about
four times its actual content.
Older UNIX systems may create real
file blocks for these holes when touched.
These files cannot be copied
by normal means (cp, cat, tp, tar, ar)
without filling in the holes.

(currently 1024 bytes).

together must fit on a single block.
