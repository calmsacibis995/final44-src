.tl ''\fB\s+2The Garbage Collector\s0\fP'
.pp
The garbage collector is invoked automatically whenever a collectable
data type runs out.
All data types are collectable except strings and atoms are not.
After a garbage collection finishes, the collector will call the function 
.i gcafter
which should be a lambda of one argument.
The argument passed to 
.i gcafter
is the name of the data type which ran out and caused the garbage collection.
It is 
.i gcafter 's
responsibility to 
allocate more pages of free space.
The default 
.i gcafter 
makes its decision based on the percentage of space still in 
use after the garbage collection.
If there is a large percentage of space still in use, 
.i gcafter
allocates a larger amount of free space than if only a small percentage of
space is still in use.
The default 
.i gcafter
will also print a summary of the space in use if the variable 
.i $gcprint
is non nil.
The summary always includes the state of the list and fixnum space and 
will include another type if it caused the garbage collection.
The type which caused the garbage collection is preceded by an asterisk.

There are two simple functions to help you debug your programs:
.i baktrace 
and 
.i showstack .
When an error occurs (or when you type the interrupt character),
you will be left at a break level with the state of the computation
frozen in the stack.
At this point, calling  the function
.i showstack
will cause the contents of the lisp evaluation stack to be printed in
reverse chronological order (most recent first).
When the programs you are running are interpreted or traced, the output
of 
.i showstack 
can be very verbose.
The function
.i baktrace
prints a summary of what 
.i showstack 
prints.
That is, if showstack would print a list, 
.i baktrace
would only print the first element of the list.
If you are running compiled code with the \fI(status\ translink)\fP non
nil, then fast links are being made.
In this case, 
there is not enough information on the stack for 
.i showstack
and 
.i baktrace .
Thus, if you are debugging compiled code you should probably do 
\fI(sstatus\ translink\ nil)\fP.
.pp
If the contents of the stack don't tell you enough about your problem, the
next thing you may 
want to try is to run your program with
certain functions traced.
You can direct the trace package to stop program execution when it enters
a function, allowing you to examine the contents of variables or 
call other functions.
The trace package is documented in Chapter 11.
.pp
It is also possible to single step the evaluator and to look at stack
frames within lisp.
The programs which 
perform these actions are described in Chapters 14 and 15.

.tl ''\fB\s+2The Interpreter\'s Top Level\s0\fP''
.pp
The default top level interpreter for Franz, named 
.i franz-top-level
is defined in /usr/lib/lisp/toplevel.l
It is given control when the lisp system starts up because the 
variable top-level is bound to the symbol
.i franz-top-level .
The first action 
.i franz-top-level 
takes is to print out the name of the current
version of the lisp system.
Then it loads the file .lisprc from the HOME directory of the person
invoking the lisp system if that file exists.
The .lisprc file allows you to set up your own defaults, read in files,
set up autoloading  or anything else you might want to do to personalize
the lisp system.
Next, the top level goes into a prompt-read-eval-print loop.
Each time around the loop, before printing the prompt it checks 
if the variable user-top-level is bound.
If so, then the value of user-top-level will be 
.i funcall ed.
This provides a convenient way for a user to introduce his own top level
(Liszt, the lisp compiler, is an example of a program which uses this).
If the user types a ^D (which is the end of file character), and  the
standard input is not from a keyboard, the lisp system will exit.
If the standard input is a keyboard and if the value of 
.i "(status\ ignoreeof)"
is nil, the lisp system will also exit.
Otherwise the end of file will be ignored.
When a 
.i reset 
is done
the current value of 
.i errlist
is saved away and control is thrown back up to the top level where 
.i eval
is mapped over the saved value of 
.i errlist.

It is also possible to single step the evaluator and to look at stack
frames within lisp.
The programs which take advantage of these things are in /usr/lib/lisp
and are called step and fixit.
They are maintained by the people at Carnegie-Mellon (currently Lars Ericson
is in charge of the code there).
There are documentation files for these programs in /usr/lib/lisp as well.
We run compiled lisp almost exclusively at Berkeley.
Sites which run a mostly interpreted code should examine these
files.
