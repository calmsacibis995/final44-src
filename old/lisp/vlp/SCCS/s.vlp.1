.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Vlp
formats the named files so that they can be run through
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr vtroff 1 ,
or
.Xr troff 1
to produce listings that line-up and are attractive.
E 4
The first non-blank character of each line is lined-up vertically,
as in the source file.
Comments (text beginning with a semicolon)
are printed in italics.
Each function's name is printed in bold face next to the function.
This format makes Lisp code look attractive when it is printed with a 
variable width font.

\fIvlp\fR works as a filter and sends its output to the standard output.

However,
the

If no files are specified,

The following options are available:
D 4
.TP
.B \-p
The
.B \-p
switch changes the size of the text from its default value of 8 points
to one of 6, 8, 10, or 12 points.
Once set, the point size is used for all subsequent files.
This point size does not apply to embedded text (see \fI\-f\fR below).
.TP

I 4

except those lines between the directives
.Sy .Ls

D 4

E 4
The

.B \-l
switch prevents \fIvlp\fR from placing labels next to functions.
E 4
I 4
.Fl l
switch prevents
.Nm vlp
from placing labels next to functions.
E 4
This switch is useful for embedded Lisp code,
where the labels would be distracting.

The

switch changes the size of the text from its default value of 8 points
to one of 6, 8, 10, or 12 points.
Once set, the point size is used for all subsequent files.
This point size does not apply to embedded text (see
.Fl f

A title to be printed on each page may be specified by using the

I 4
.Fl T
E 4
switch.
The

.B \-T
switch applies only to the next file name given.
E 4
I 4
.Fl T
switch applies only to the next

Titles are not printed for embedded text (see

This switch may not be used if \fIvlp\fR is reading from the standard input.
