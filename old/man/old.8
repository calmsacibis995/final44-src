.SH DESCRIPTION
After the 3rd Berkeley Distribution,
the formats for binary and archive files were changed.
The binaries were modified to allow arbitrary length symbols,
which required adding a string table
at the end of the symbol table,
and having symbol table entries point into the names in that table.
The archive was modified to be a portable format,
using strings instead of binary numbers,
to avoid problems of different sizes of integers
on different machines.
These changes are incompatible with
older formats.
.PP
.B /usr/old
is the root of a hierarchy of
binaries,
include files,
and libraries
in the old
binary and archive formats.
They contain a complete set of programs and files
necessary for people
who need to deal
with the original \s-2UNIX\s+2
formats.
.PP
In order to create new binaries in the old format,
one must include the right header files.
For example,
to create a program called \*(lqfoo\*(rq
which uses the old math library
in the old format,
say
