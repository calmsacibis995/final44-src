.SH NAME
rv \- Racal/Vadic ACU interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The racal/vadic ACU interface is provided by the files
.I /dev/cua[01]
which is a multiplexed file, and by the daemon
.I dnd
which monitors the file, simulating a standard DN dialer.
To place an outgoing call one forks a sub-process
trying to open
.I /dev/cul?
and then opens the corresponding file
.I /dev/cua?
file and writes a number on it.
The daemon translates the call to proper format for the
Racal/Vadic interface, and monitors the progress of the call
recording accounting information for later use.
.PP
The codes for the phone numbers are the same as in the DN interface:
.TP
0-9
dial 0-9
.br
.ns
.TP
.B :
dial *
.br
.ns
.TP
.B ;
dial #

.br
.ns
.TP
<

.PP
The entire telephone number must be
presented in a single
.I write
system call.
.PP
It is require that an end-of-number
code be given.

.SH BUGS
Locking problems.

The multiplexor seems to have rare-case bugs which occasinally crash
the system taking trap type 9's, usually in the
.I sdata
system routine.
