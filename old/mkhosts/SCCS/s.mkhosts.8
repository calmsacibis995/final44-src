I 3
is used to generated the hashed host database used by one version of the

library routines
.B gethostbyaddr()
and
.BR gethostbyname() .

It is not used if host name translation is performed by
.IR named (8).
E 3
If the
.B \-v
option is supplied, each host will be listed as it is added.
The file
.I hostfile
is usually /etc/hosts, and in any case
must be in the format of /etc/hosts (see hosts(5)).

will generate database files named
.I hostfile.pag
and
.I hostfile.dir.
The new database is build in a set of temporary files and
only replaces the real database if the new one is built
without errors.
.I Mkhosts
will exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors are detected.
