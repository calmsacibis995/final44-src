.SH DESCRIPTION
I 7
.ft B
Mkpasswd has been obsoleted by pwd_mkdb(8).
.ft R
.PP
E 7
.I Mkpasswd
is used to generated the hashed password database used by the
D 5
library routines
.B getpwnam()
and
.BR getpwuid() .
If the
.B \-v
option is supplied, each entry will be listed as it is added.
E 5
I 5
password library routines (see
.IR getpwent (3)).
.PP
E 5
The file
.I passwdfile
D 5
is usually /etc/ptmp (invoked by vipw(8)), and in any case
must be in the format of /etc/passwd (see passwd(5)).
E 5
I 5
must be in password file format (see
.IR passwd (5)).
E 5
.I Mkpasswd
D 5
will generate database files named
.I passwdfile.pag
and
.I passwdfile.dir.
E 5
I 5
generates database files named ``passwdfile.pag'' and
``passwdfile.dir'' (see
.IR ndbm (3)).
Data subsequently taken from the database files differ from
.I passwdfile
in one respect.
Rather than storing the encrypted password in the database,
.I mkpasswd
stores the offset of the encrypted password in
.IR passwdfile .
.PP
E 5
.I Mkpasswd
D 5
will exit with a non-zero exit code if any errors are detected.
.SH FILES
.ta \w'passwdfile.dir    'u
\fIpasswdfile\fR.pag	- database filenames
.br
\fIpasswdfile\fR.dir
E 5
I 5
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.PP
The
.I \-p
option causes
.I mkpasswd
to create ``passwdfile.orig'', a password file in the
standard Version 7 format.
