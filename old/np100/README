This directory provides some ancillary programs necessary for
operation of the Interlan Np100 ethernet interface.

This interface is unusual in that it requires loading firmware
into the controller before it may be used as a network interface.
This is accomplished by opening a character special device,
and writing data to it.

The sequence of commands would be:

	# npload np.image
	# sleep 10
	# ifconfig ix0 ...

It is also possible to do post-mortem debugging of firmware failures
by reading the local memory of the device.

Typical use would be:

	# npdump np.core

If the device needs to be reset, you would issue:

	# ifconfig ix0 down
	# npload np.image
	# sleep 10
	# ifconfig ix0 up
