In an attempt to speed up the Fortran 77
compiler, we have provided a new interface between
the fortran compiler and the portable C compiler.
The intermediate file is binary, and the result is
to speed up the execution of Fortran considerably.
The changes necessary to make this work are as follows:

***	The ONEPASS flag should be off for Fortran;
	the simplest way of making this happen is to take
	the line # define ONEPASS on macdefs, and put a
	# ifndef FORT ... # endif around it.

***	The function label from pass 1 must be put in
	a file, fort.h.  Also,  a simple function, tlabel,
	must be written to copy names and make labels.

***	The function `where' must be defined, as well as the
	function main (which was once on local2.c).
	They can be defined on fort.h, or on local2.c
	(surrounded by # ifnded ONEPASS and # endif)

***	Other things from pass one may have crept into the pass 2
	code: they must be also done, either on fort.h or
	on local2.c surrounded by ifdefs.

***	make fort  then creates the fortran interface...
