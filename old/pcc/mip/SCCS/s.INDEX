This directory contains the machine independent parts of the
portable C compiler.  For more explanation of how these files
are used, see the "Tour through the Portable C Compiler"
in Volume 2 of the UNIX(TM) documentation.

The makefile in this directory is useful when makeing a compiler;
create a directory, copy the makefile into it, write the
machine dependent files, and you are off and running.  The file g
is a useful aid for finding out when things are used.

The pcc command (see the pcc source) uses this makefile and
the files in this directory.  Lint also uses the files.
