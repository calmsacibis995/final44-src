.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pr
utility is a printing and pagination filter.
If multiple
input files are specified, each is read, formatted,
and written to standard output.
By default, the input is
separated into pages, each with a header that includes the
page number, date, time, and the file's pathname.
Text
columns are of equal width, with at least one <blank>
separation between text columns.
Lines that do not fit into
a text column are truncated.
If standard output is associated
with a terminal, diagnostic messages are suppressed
until the
.Nm
utility has completed processing.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Cm \&+ Ns Ar page 
Begin output at page number page of the
formatted input.
.It Fl Ns Ar column 
Produce output that is columns wide (default
is 1) and is in text column rank order.
This
option should not be used with
.Fl m .
When
used with
.Fl t ,
use the minimum number of lines
to display the output.
.It Fl f
Use <form-feed> character for new pages,
instead of the default behavior that uses a
sequence of <newline> characters.
Prior to
displaying the first page of output an
<alert> character is written to standard output.
.It  Fl h Ns Ar header 
Use the string header as the header to be
printed instead of file.
.It Fl l Ns Ar lines 
Override the 66 line default and reset the
page length to lines.
If lines is smaller
than the sum of both the header and trailer
depths (in lines), the
.Nm pr
utility suppresses
both the header and trailer, as if the
.Fl t
option were in effect.
.It Fl m
Merge files.
Standard output is formatted so
the
.Nm pr
utility writes one line from each file
specified by a file operand, side by side
into text columns of equal fixed widths, in
terms of the number of column positions.
.It Fl s Ns Ar char 
Separate text columns by the single character
char instead of by the appropriate number of
<space>s (default for char is the <tab> character).
.It Fl t
Print neither the five-line identifying
header nor the five-line trailer usually
supplied for each page.
Quit printing after the
last line of each file without spacing to the
end of the page.
.It Fl w Ns Ar width 
Set the width of the line to width column
positions for multiple text-column output
only (default is 72).
.El
.Pp
The following operands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file to be printed.
.El
.Pp
If no file
operands are specified, or if a file operand is
.Sq Fl ,
the standard input is used.
.Pp
The standard input is used only if no file operands are
specified, or if a file operand is
.Sq Fl .
.Pp
If
.Nm pr
receives an interrupt while printing to a terminal, it
flushes all accumulated error messages to the screen before
terminating.
.Pp
The
.Nm pr
utility output is a paginated version of the original
file (or files).
This pagination is optionally done using
<form-feed>s or a sequence of <newline>s.
Page headers are
generated unless the
.Fl t
option is specified.
.Pp
The
.Nm pr
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
Error
messages are written to standard error during the printing
process (if output is redirected) or after all successful
file printing is complete (when printing to a terminal).

The
.Nm pr
function is expected to be

compatible.
