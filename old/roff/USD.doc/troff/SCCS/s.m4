Hyphenation.
.pg
The automatic hyphenation may be switched off and on.
When switched on with \fBhy\fR,
several variants may be set.
A \fIhyphenation indicator\fR character may be imbedded in a word to
specify desired hyphenation points,
or may be prepended to suppress hyphenation.
In addition,
the user may specify a small exception word list.
.pg
Only words that consist of a central alphabetic string
surrounded by (usually null) non-alphabetic strings
are considered candidates for automatic hyphenation.
Words that were input containing hyphens
(minus),
em-dashes (\fB\e(em\fR),
or hyphenation indicator characters\
\(emsuch as mother-in-law\(em\
are \fIalways\fR subject to splitting after those characters,
whether or not automatic hyphenation is on or off.

Three Part Titles.
.pg
The titling function \fBtl\fR provides for automatic placement
of three fields at the left, center, and right of a line
with a title-length
specifiable with \fBlt\fR.
\fBtl\fR may be used anywhere, and is independent of the
normal text collecting process.
A common use is in header and footer macros.
.h1
.bt
\fB&tl\fI|\'left\|\'center\|\'right\|\'\fR	-	-	\
The strings \fIleft\fR, \fIcenter\fR, and \fIright\fR are
respectively left-adjusted, centered, and right-adjusted
in the current title-length.
Any of the strings may be empty,
and overlapping is permitted.
If the page-number character (initially \fB%\fR) is found within any of the fields it is replaced
by the current page number having the format assigned to register \fB%\fR.
Any character may be used as the string delimiter.
.bt
\fB&pc\fI|c\fR	\fB%\fR	off	-	The page number character is set to \fIc\fR,
or removed.
The page-number register remains \fB%\fR.
.bt
\fB&lt\fI|\(+-N\fR	6.5\|in	previous	E,\fBm\fR	Length of title set to \fI\(+-N\fR.
The line-length and the title-length are \fIindependent\fR.
Indents do not apply to titles; page-offsets do.
.mh
Output Line Numbering.
.pg
.ll -\w'0000'u
.nm 1 3
Automatic sequence numbering of output lines may be
requested with \fBnm\fR.
When in effect,
a three-digit, arabic number plus a digit-space
is prepended to output text lines.
The text lines are thus offset by four digit-spaces,
and otherwise retain their line length;
a reduction in line length may be desired to keep the right margin
aligned with an earlier margin.
Blank lines, other vertical spaces, and lines generated by \fBtl\fR
are \fInot\fR numbered.
Numbering can be temporarily suspended with \fBnn\fR,
or with an \fB.nm\fR followed by a later \fB.nm|+0\fR.
In addition,
a line number indent \fII\fR, and the number-text separation \fIS\fR
may be specified in digit-spaces.
Further, it can be specified that only those line numbers that are
multiples of some number \fIM\fR are to be printed (the others will appear
as blank number fields).

Line number mode.
If \fI\(+-N\fR is given,
line numbering is turned on,
and the next output line numbered is numbered \fI\(+-N\fR.
Default values are \fIM=\fR\|1, \fIS=\fR\|1, and \fII=\fR\|0.
Parameters corresponding to missing arguments are unaffected;
a non-numeric argument is considered missing.
In the absence of all arguments, numbering is turned off;
the next line number is preserved for possible further use
in number register \fBln\fR.
.bt
\fB&nn\fI|N\fR	-	\fIN=\fR1	E	The next \fIN\fR text output lines are not
numbered.
.pg
.ll -\w'0000'u

As an example, the paragraph portions of this section
are numbered with \fIM=\fR\|3:
\&\fB.nm|1|3\fR was placed at the beginning;
\&\fB.nm\fR was placed at the end of the first paragraph;
and \fB.nm|+0\fR was placed in front of this paragraph;
and \fB.nm\fR finally placed at the end.
Line lengths were also changed (by \fB\ew\'0000\'u\fR) to keep the right side aligned.
Another example is
\&\fB.nm|+5|5|x|3\fR which turns on numbering with the line number of the next
D 7
line to be 5 greater than the last numbered line,
E 7
I 7

If the condition \fIc\fR is \fItrue\fR, or if the number \fIN\fR is greater than zero,
or if the strings compare identically (including motions and character size and font),
\fIanything\fR is accepted as input.
If a \fB!\fR precedes the condition, number, or string comparison,
the sense of the acceptance is reversed.
.pg
Any spaces between the condition and the beginning of \fIanything\fR are skipped over.
The \fIanything\fR can be either a single input line (text, macro, or whatever)
or a number of input lines.
In the multi-line case,
the first line must begin with a left delimiter \fB\e{\fR and
the last line must end with a right delimiter \fB\e}\fR.
.pg
The request \fBie\fR (if-else) is identical to \fBif\fR
except that the acceptance state is remembered.
A subsequent and matching \fBel\fR (else) request then uses the reverse sense of that state.
\fBie\fR|-|\fBel\fR pairs may be nested.

Environment Switching.
.pg
A number of the parameters that
control the text processing are gathered together into an
\fIenvironment\fR, which can be switched by the user.
The environment parameters are those associated
with requests noting E in their \fINotes\fR column;
in addition, partially collected lines and words are in the environment.
Everything else is global; examples are page-oriented parameters,
diversion-oriented parameters, number registers, and macro and string definitions.
All environments are initialized with default parameter values.
.h1
.bt
\fB&ev\fI|N\fR	\fIN\(eq\fR0	previous	-	Environment switched to

Switching is done in push-down fashion so that
restoring a previous environment \fImust\fR be done with \fB.ev\fR
rather than specific reference.
.mh
Insertions from the Standard Input
.pg
The input can be temporarily switched to the system \fIstandard input\fR
with \fBrd\fR,
which will switch back when \fItwo\fR newlines
in a row are found (the \fIextra\fR blank line is not used).
This mechanism is intended for insertions in form-letter-like documentation.
On \s-1UNIX\s+1, the \fIstandard input\fR can be the user's keyboard,
a \fIpipe\fR, or a \fIfile\fR.

E 7
E 4
Read insertion from the standard input until two newlines in a row are found.
If the standard input is the user's keyboard, \fIprompt\fR (or a \s-1BEL\s+1)
is written onto the user's terminal.
\fBrd\fR behaves like a macro,
and arguments may be placed after \fIprompt\fR.
.bt
\fB&ex\fR	-	-	-	Exit from \*(NR\(sl\*(TR.
Text processing is terminated exactly as if all input had ended.
.pg
If insertions are to be
taken from the terminal keyboard \fIwhile\fR output is being printed
on the terminal, the command line option \fB\-q\fR will turn off the echoing
of keyboard input and prompt only with \s-1BEL\s+1.
The regular input and insertion input \fIcannot\fR
simultaneously come from the standard input.
.pg
As an example,
multiple copies of a form letter may be prepared by entering the insertions
for all the copies in one file to be used as the standard input,
and causing the file containing the letter to reinvoke itself using \fBnx\fR (\(sc19);
the process would ultimately be ended by an \fBex\fR in the insertion file.

The latter is different from the \fIstandard output\fR,

By default, both are written onto the user's terminal,
but they can be independently redirected.
.pg
Various \fIerror\fR conditions may occur during
the operation of \*(NR and \*(TR.
Certain less serious errors having only local impact do not
cause processing to terminate.
Two examples are \fIword overflow\fR, caused by a word that is too large
to fit into the word buffer (in fill mode), and
\fIline overflow\fR, caused by an output line that grew too large
to fit in the line buffer;
in both cases, a message is printed, the offending excess
is discarded,
and the affected word or line is marked at the point of truncation
with a \(** in \*(NR and a \(lh in \*(TR.
The philosophy is to continue processing, if possible,
on the grounds that output useful for debugging may be produced.
If a serious error occurs, processing terminates,
and an appropriate message is printed.
Examples are the inability to create, read, or write files,
and the exceeding of certain internal limits that
make future output unlikely to be useful.
