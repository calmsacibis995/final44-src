.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tar
tape archive command
E 5
dumps several files into one, in a medium suitable for transportation.
D 5
.PP
A ``tar tape'' or file is a series of blocks.  Each block is of size TBLOCK.
E 5
I 5
.Pp
A ``tar tape'' or file is a series of blocks.  Each block is of size
.Dv TBLOCK .
E 5
A file on the tape is represented by a header block which describes
the file, followed by zero or more blocks which give the contents of the
file.  At the end of the tape are two blocks filled with binary
zeros, as an end-of-file indicator.  
D 5
.PP
The blocks are grouped for physical I/O operations.  Each group of
.I n
E 5

.IR tar (1)

I 5
.Xr tar 1
E 5
command line \(em default is 20 blocks) is written with a single system
call; on nine-track tapes, the result of this write is a single tape
record.  The last group is always written at the full size, so blocks after
the two zero blocks contain random data.  On reading, the specified or
default group size is used for the
first read, but if that read returns less than a full tape block, the reduced
block size is used for further reads.

The first time a given i-node number is dumped, it is dumped as a regular
file.  The second and subsequent times, it is dumped as a link instead.
Upon retrieval, if a link entry is retrieved, but not the file it was
linked to, an error message is printed and the tape must be manually
re-scanned to retrieve the linked-to file.
