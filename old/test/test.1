.Sh NAME
.Nm test
.Nd Condition evaluation utility.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm test
.Ar expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm test
utility evaluates the expression and, if it evaluates
to true, returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise
it returns 1 (false).
If there is no expression, test also
returns 1 (false).
.Pp
All operators and flags are separate arguments to the
.Nm test
utility.
.Pp
The following primaries are used to construct expression:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl b Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is a block special
file.
.It Fl c Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is a character
special file.
.It Fl d Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is a directory.
.It Fl f Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is a regular file.
.It Fl g Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and its set group ID flag
is set.
.It Fl n Ar string
True if the length of
.Ar string
is nonzero.
.It Fl p Ar file
True if
.Ar file
is a named pipe
.Po Tn FIFO Pc .
.It Fl r Ar file
True if
.Ar file exists and is readable.
.It Fl s Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and has a size greater
than zero.
.It Fl t Ar [file_descriptor]
True if the file whose file descriptor number
is
.Ar file_descriptor
(default 1) is open and is
associated with a terminal.
.It Fl u Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and its set user ID flag
is set.
.It Fl w Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is writable.
True
indicates only that the write flag is on.
The file is not writable on a read-only file
system even if this test indicates true.
.It Fl x Ar file
True if
.Ar file
exists and is executable.
True
indicates only that the execute flag is on.
If
.Ar file
is a directory, true indicates that
.Ar file
can be searched.
.It Fl z Ar string
True if the length of
.Ar string
is zero.
.It Ar string
True if
.Ar string
is not the null
string.
.It Ar \&s\&1 Cm \&= Ar \&s\&2
True if the strings
.Ar \&s\&1
and
.Ar \&s\&2
are identical.
.It Ar \&s\&1 Cm \&!= Ar \&s\&2
True if the strings
.Ar \&s\&1
and
.Ar \&s\&2
are not identical.
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&eq Ar \&n\&2 
True if the integers
.Ar \&n\&1
and
.Ar \&n\&2
are algebraically
equal.
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&ne Ar \&n\&2
True if the integers
.Ar \&n\&1
and
.Ar \&n\&2
are not
algebraically equal.
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&gt Ar \&n\&2
True if the integer
.Ar \&n\&1
is algebraically
greater than the integer
.Ar \&n\&2 .
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&ge Ar \&n\&2
True if the integer
.Ar \&n\&1
is algebraically
greater than or equal to the integer
.Ar \&n\&2 .
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&lt Ar \&n\&2
True if the integer
.Ar \&n\&1
is algebraically less
than the integer
.Ar \&n\&2 .
.It Ar \&n\&1 Fl \&le Ar \&n\&2
True if the integer
.Ar \&n\&1
is algebraically less
than or equal to the integer
.Ar \&n\&2 .
.El
.Pp
These primaries can be combined with the following operators:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Cm \&! Ar expression
True if
.Ar expression
is false.
.It Ar expression1 Fl a Ar expression2
True if both
.Ar expression1
and
.Ar expression2
are true.
.It Ar expression1 Fl o Ar expression2
True if either
.Ar expression1
or
.Ar expression2
are true.
.It Cm \&( Ns Ar expression Ns Cm \&)
True if expression is true.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl a
operator has higher precedence than the
.Fl o
operator.
.Pp
The
.Nm test
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
expression evaluated to true.
.It 1
expression evaluated to false or expression was
missing.
.It >1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm test
function is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
