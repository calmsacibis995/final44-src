.AT 3
.SH NAME
uudiff \- directory comparison between machines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uudiff
[ \-d ]
local-name remote-name
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Uudiff
compares the files in the directory
.I local-name
and the directory
.I remote-name,
(where
.I remote-name
may be of the form
.I system-name!directory-name
and
.I system-name
is a 
.I uucp
Unix name).
It reports (via mail)
which files are added, deleted, or changed, and provides
a
.I diff(1)
of altered printable files.
.PP
If a part of
.I remote-name
is omitted
(either the system or the directory)
the corresponding part of
.I local-name
is used.
If
.I local-name
is a file, rather than a directory,
.I remote-name
is also assumed to be a file and the program degenerates into
.IR diff(1) .
.PP
The option
.B \-d
does not diff altered files; only
the summary by file names is prepared.
.SH FILES
Lots.  Files zz[abcdeglmn]????? are used for scratch space;
files brought back from the remote machine for
.I diffing
are stored (and left around) as
.I name.?????
and the final report is left in
.I uudiff.?????
(the exact name is reported by mail).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
diff(1), uucp(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Almost none.  Anything more serious than misspelling
.I local-name
causes unpredictable and obscure results.
.SH BUGS
In addition to the standard
.I uucp
requirements a hook is needed at the remote
system, and at present is only installed
on the systems "research" and "inter".
.br
This program is written in shell and should be translated
to C so it could give diagnostics.
.br
Even if "remote-system" is the local system, uudiff
is subject to delays in uucp traffic.
.br
It should probably write the standard output, instead of insisting
on going into the background.
.br
Since checksums are used there is a probability of 1 in 2**32
of missing differences between files.
.br
The ~userid syntax is not recognized.
