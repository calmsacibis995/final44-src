.Nm Whereis
E 7
locates source/binary and manuals sections for specified files.
The supplied names are first stripped of leading pathname components
D 7
and any (single) trailing extension of the form ``.ext'', e.g. ``.c''.
Prefixes of ``s.'' resulting from use of source code control are also
E 7
I 7
and of any (single) trailing extension of the form
.Ql .ext ,
e.g. 
.Ql \&.c .
Prefixes of
.Ql \&.s
resulting from use of source code control are also
E 7
dealt with.

Search for binaries.
.It Fl f
Signals the end of a directory list specified by one or more of the

E 7

D 7
.B \-m

.I whereis
searches only for binaries, sources or manual sections respectively
(or any two thereof).
The
.B \-u
flag may be used to search for unusual entries.
E 7
I 7
.Fl S
options and the start of file
.Ar names .
.It Fl m
Search for manual entries.
.It Fl s
Search for source.
.It Fl u
Search for unusual entries.
E 7
A file is said to be unusual if it does not have one entry of
each requested type.
D 7
Thus ``whereis -m -u *'' asks for those files in the current

Finally, the
.B \-B
.B \-M
and
.B \-S
flags may be used to change or otherwise limit the places where
.I whereis
searches.
The
.B \-f
file flags is used to terminate the last such directory list
and signal the start of file names.
