.Nm Badsect
E 6
makes a file to contain a bad sector.  Normally, bad sectors
are made inaccessible by the standard formatter, which provides
a forwarding table for bad sectors to the driver; see
D 6
.IR bad144 (8)
E 6
I 6
.Xr bad144 8
E 6
for details.
If a driver supports the bad blocking standard it is much preferable to
use that method to isolate bad blocks, since the bad block forwarding
makes the pack appear perfect, and such packs can then be copied with
D 2
.IR dd (8).

can't make amends for

is used on a quiet file system in the following way:
First mount the file system, and change to its root directory.
D 2
Make a directory BAD there and change into it.  Run badsect
giving as argument all the bad sectors you wish to add.
(The sector numbers should be relative to the beginning of
the file system, but this is not hard to do as
the system reports relative sector numbers in its console error messages.)

Make a directory BAD there.  Run

E 6
all the bad sectors you wish to add.
(The sector numbers must be relative to the beginning of
the file system, but this is not hard as the system reports
relative sector numbers in its console error messages.)

Then change back to the root directory, unmount the file system
and run
D 6
.IR fsck (8)

D 2
The file has 0 length, but the check programs
will still consider it to contain the block containing the sector.
This has the pleasant effect that the sector is completely inaccessible
to the containing file system
since it is not available by accessing the file.
