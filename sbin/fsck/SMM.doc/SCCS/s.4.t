Appendix A \- Fsck Error Conditions
.NH 2 
Conventions
.PP
.I Fsck
is
a multi-pass file system check program.
Each file system pass invokes a different Phase of the
.I fsck
program.
After the initial setup,
.I fsck
performs successive Phases over each file system,
checking blocks and sizes,
path-names,
connectivity,
reference counts,
and the map of free blocks,
(possibly rebuilding it),
and performs some cleanup.
.LP
Normally
.I fsck
is run non-interactively to
.I preen
the file systems after an unclean halt.
While preen'ing a file system,
it will only fix corruptions that are expected
to occur from an unclean halt.
These actions are a proper subset of the actions that 
.I fsck
will take when it is running interactively.
Throughout this appendix many errors have several options
that the operator can take.
When an inconsistency is detected,
.I fsck
reports the error condition to the operator.
If a response is required,
.I fsck
prints a prompt message and
waits for a response.
When preen'ing most errors are fatal.
For those that are expected,
the response taken is noted.
This appendix explains the meaning of each error condition,
the possible responses, and the related error conditions.
.LP
The error conditions are organized by the
.I Phase
of the
.I fsck
program in which they can occur.
The error conditions that may occur
in more than one Phase
will be discussed in initialization.
.NH 2 
Initialization
.PP
Before a file system check can be performed, certain
tables have to be set up and certain files opened.
This section concerns itself with the opening of files and
the initialization of tables.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
command line options,
memory requests,
opening of files,
status of files,
file system size checks,
and creation of the scratch file.
D 2
All of the initialization errors are fatal
E 2
I 2
All the initialization errors are fatal
E 2
when the file system is being preen'ed.

Phase 1 \- Check Blocks and Sizes
.PP
This phase concerns itself with
the inode list.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
checking inode types,
setting up the zero-link-count table,
examining inode block numbers for bad or duplicate blocks,
checking inode size,
and checking inode format.
All errors in this phase except
.B "INCORRECT BLOCK COUNT"

E 2
The mode word of the inode \fII\fP indicates that the inode is not a
special block inode, special character inode, socket inode, regular inode,
symbolic link, or directory inode.
.LP
Possible responses to the CLEAR prompt are:

midst of truncating a file.
When preen'ing the file system,

Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP with a number
lower than the number of the first data block in the file system or

This error condition may invoke the
.B "EXCESSIVE BAD BLKS"

error condition in Phase 1 if
E 3
I 3
error condition in Phase 1 (see next paragraph) if
E 3
inode \fII\fP has too many block numbers outside the file system range.
This error condition will always invoke the

error condition in Phase 2 and Phase 4.

Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:

Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP that is already claimed by
E 2
another inode.
This error condition may invoke the
.B "EXCESSIVE DUP BLKS"
error condition in Phase 1 if
inode \fII\fP has too many block numbers claimed by other inodes.
This error condition will always invoke Phase 1b and the
.B "BAD/DUP"

Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:

Possible responses to the CORRECT prompt are:
.IP YES
replace the block count of inode \fII\fP with \fIY\fP.

Phase 1B: Rescan for More Dups
.PP
When a duplicate block is found in the file system, the file system is
D 2
rescanned to find the inode which previously claimed that block.

.LP
.B "\fIB\fP DUP I=\fII\fP"
.br
Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP that

error condition in Phase 2.
You can determine which inodes have overlapping blocks by examining
this error condition and the DUP error condition in Phase 1.
.NH 2 
Phase 2 \- Check Pathnames
.PP
This phase concerns itself with removing directory entries
pointing to
error conditioned inodes
from Phase 1 and Phase 1b.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
root inode mode and status,
