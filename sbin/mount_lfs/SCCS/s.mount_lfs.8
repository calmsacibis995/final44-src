E 3
I 3
D 4
command attaches the log-structured file system
E 3
residing on the device named by
.Ar device
to the global file system namespace.
The file system is attached at the point
specified by
.Ar mount_point .
E 4
I 4
command attaches a log-structured file system
.Ar special
device on to the file system tree at the point
.Ar node .
In addition, the
.Xr lfs_cleanerd 8
utility is invoked to clean the file system periodically.
.Pp
E 4
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time.
.Pp
D 4
After the file system is mounted, if the
.Fl n
flag is not specified then the

.Nm mount_lfs ,
they are passed to the cleaner.
