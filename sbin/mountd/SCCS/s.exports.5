Each line in the file specifies one remote mount point.
The first field is the mount point directory path followed
optionally by export options and specific hosts separated by white space.
Only the first entry for a given local file system may specify the export
D 2
options, since these are handled on a \fIper local file system\fR basis.

I 2
options, since these are handled on a
.Em per local file system
basis.
E 2
If no specific hosts are specified,
the mount point is exported to all hosts.
E 3
I 3
Each line in the file
(other than comment lines that begin with a #)
D 5
specifies either a ``netgroup'' list or a remote mount point.
If the first field begins with a '/' then it is considered a mount entry.
Otherwise it is considered a ``netgroup'',
a list of hosts that are to be referred to by a group name.
In a ``netgroup'' list,
the first field is the name of the ``netgroup'' followed
by a list of hosts separated by whitespace.
E 5
I 5
specifies the mount point(s) and export flags within one local server
filesystem for one or more hosts.
A host may be specified only once for each local filesystem on the
server and there may be only one default entry for each server
filesystem that applies to all other hosts.
The latter exports the filesystem to the ``world'' and should
be used only when the filesystem contains public information.

The export options are as follows:
E 3
I 3
In a mount entry,
D 5
the first field is the mount point directory path optionally followed
by groups of export options and specific hosts or ``netgroups''
to which those options apply.
I 4
The name of a ``netgroup'' is distinguished from that of a host
by preceeding it with a dollar sign.
E 4
A filesystem may appear multiple times with
different sets of hosts each with different export options.
If a set of export options are specified at the end
of the line with no hosts following them,
then the mount point is exported to all
other hosts with those export options.
There may be at most one such listing per local filesystem.
E 5
I 5
the first field(s) specify the directory path(s) within a server filesystem
that can be mounted on by the corresponding client(s).
There are two forms of this specification.
The first is to list all mount points as absolute
directory paths separated by whitespace.
The second is to specify the pathname of the root of the filesystem
followed by the
.Fl alldirs
flag;
D 10
this form allows the host(s) to mount any directory within the filesystem.
E 10
I 10
this form allows the host(s) to mount at any point within the filesystem,
including regular files if the
.Fl r
option is used on mountd.
E 10
I 9
The pathnames must not have any symbolic links in them and should not have
any "." or ".." components.
E 9
Mount points for a filesystem may appear on multiple lines each with
different sets of hosts and export options.

The second component of a line specifies how the filesystem is to be
exported to the host set.
The option flags specify whether the filesystem
is exported read-only or read-write and how the client uid is mapped to
user credentials on the server.

The third component of a line specifies the host set to which the line applies.
The set may be specified in three ways.
The first way is to list the host name(s) separated by white space.
(Standard internet ``dot'' addresses may be used in place of names.)
The second way is to specify a ``netgroup'' as defined in the netgroup file (see
.Xr netgroup 5 ).
The third way is to specify an internet subnetwork using a network and
network mask that is defined as the set of all hosts with addresses within
the subnetwork.
This latter approach requires less overhead within the
kernel and is recommended for cases where the export line refers to a
large number of clients within an administrative subnet.
.Pp
The first two cases are specified by simply listing the name(s) separated
by whitespace.
All names are checked to see if they are ``netgroup'' names
first and are assumed to be hostnames otherwise.
Using the full domain specification for a hostname can normally
circumvent the problem of a host that has the same name as a netgroup.
The third case is specified by the flag
.Sm off
.Fl network No = Sy netname
.Sm on
and optionally
.Sm off
.Fl mask No = Sy netmask .
.Sm on
If the mask is not specified, it will default to the mask for that network
class (A, B or C; see
.Xr inet 5 ).

The export options are tied to the local mount points in the kernel and
must be non-contradictory for any exported subdirectory of the local
server mount point.
It is recommended that all exported directories within the same server

You cannot specify a hostname that is also the name of a netgroup.
