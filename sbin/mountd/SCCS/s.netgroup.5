.Dt NETGROUP 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netgroup
.Nd defines network groups
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm netgroup
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm netgroup
file
specifies ``netgroups'', which are sets of
.Sy (host, user, domain)
tuples that are to be given similar network access.
.Pp
Each line in the file
consists of a netgroup name followed by a list of the members of the
netgroup.
Each member can be either the name of another netgroup or a specification
of a tuple as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(host, user, domain)
.Ed
where the
.Sy host ,
.Sy user ,
and
.Sy domain
are character string names for the corresponding component.
Any of the comma separated fields may be empty to specify a ``wildcard'' value
or may consist of the string ``-'' to specify ``no valid value''.
The members of the list may be separated by whitespace and/or commas;
the ``\e'' character may be used at the end of a line to specify
line continuation.
The functions specified in
.Xr getnetgrent 3
should normally be used to access the
.Nm netgroup
database.
.Pp
Lines that begin with a # are treated as comments.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/netgroup -compact
.It Pa /etc/netgroup
the netgroup database.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getnetgrent 3 ,
.Xr exports 5
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The file format is compatible with that of various vendors, however it
appears that not all vendors use an identical format.
.Sh BUGS
D 3
The interpretation of access restrictions based of the member tuples of a
E 3
I 3
The interpretation of access restrictions based on the member tuples of a
E 3
netgroup is left up to the various network applications.
Also, it is not obvious how the domain specification
applies to the BSD environment.
