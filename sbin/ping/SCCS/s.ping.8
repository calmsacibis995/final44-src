option of

The
.Tn TTL
value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers
E 7
that the packet can go through before being thrown away.

In current practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the
TTL field by exactly one.

In normal operation ping prints the ttl value from the packet it receives.
When a remote system receives a ping packet, it can do one of three things
D 7
with the TTL field in its response:
