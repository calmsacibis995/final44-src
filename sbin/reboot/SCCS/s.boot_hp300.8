.Tn UNIX
is started by placing it at the beginning of physical memory

Since the system is not reenterable,
it is necessary to read it in from disk or tape
each time it is to be bootstrapped.

is normally used.
If there are no users then
D 2
.B reboot

I 2
.Nm reboot
E 2
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then initiated.
This causes a system to be
booted and an automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
without incident, the system is then brought up for many users.

like to ``snapshot'' and analyze later.
