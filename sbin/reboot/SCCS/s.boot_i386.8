I 2

.Pq Va a_entry .
E 2
Upon startup, the system reorganizes memory to suit the needs of
the hardware configuration found, thus it is not designed to
be restartable without being reloaded on reboot.
Each time it is to be bootstrapped, it must be reloaded, usually from
a disk file.

is normally used.
If there are no users then
D 2
.B reboot

I 2
.Nm reboot
E 2
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then initiated.
This causes a system to be
booted and an automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
without incident, the system is then brought up for many users.
