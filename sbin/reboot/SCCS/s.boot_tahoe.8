D 6
.Pp
.Tn UNIX
is started by placing it in memory
E 4
at location zero and transferring to the entry point.
Since the system is not reenterable,
it is necessary to read it in from disk or tape
each time it is to be bootstrapped.

E 4
E 3
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then initiated.
This causes a system to be
booted and an automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
without incident, the system is then brought up for many users.

On the

the system will do a standard autoboot from drive 0
upon power-up or reset.
D 4

E 4
I 4
This automatic boot may be cancelled by typing a
.Ql \&#
E 4

D 4
This enters console mode; the console prompt is \*(lq>\*(rq or \*(lq#>\*(rq.
The boot flags can be set to any hexadecimal value \fIn\fP with the command
.IP
#> p23 \fIn\fP.
