.Sh DESCRIPTION
E 11
E 2
The
D 11
.I key
E 11
I 11
.Nm restore
command performs the inverse function of
.Xr dump 8 .
A full backup of a file system may be restored and
subsequent incremental backups layered on top of it.
Single files and
directory subtrees may be restored from full or partial
backups.
.Nm Restore
D 13
cannot work across a network, to do this, see the companion
command
.Xr rrestore .
E 13
I 13
works across a network;
to do this see the
.Fl f
flag described below.
E 13
D 17
The actions
of
.Nm restore
are controlled by the given
.Cm key ,
which
E 11
D 2
specifies what is to be done.
.I Key
is one of the characters
.B rRxt
optionally combined with
.BR f .
.TP
.B  f
Use the first
.I argument
as the name of the tape instead
of the default.
.TP
.B  r or R
The tape
is read and loaded into the file system
specified in
.I argument.
This should not be done lightly (see below).
If the key is
.B R
.I restor
asks which tape of a multi volume set to start on.
This allows restor to be interrupted and then
restarted (an
.I icheck
\-s must be done before restart).
.TP
.B  x
Each file on the
tape named by an 
.I argument
is extracted.
The file extracted is placed in a file with a numeric name
supplied by
.I restor
(actually the inode number).
In order to keep the amount of tape read to a minimum,
the following procedure is recommended:
.IP
Mount volume 1 of the set of dump tapes.
.IP
Type the
.I restor
command.
.IP
.I Restor
will announce whether or not it found the files,
give the number it will name the file, and rewind the tape.
.IP
It then
asks you to `mount the desired tape volume'.
Type the number of the volume you choose.
On a
multivolume dump the recommended procedure is to mount the
last through the first volume in that order.
.I Restor
checks to see if any of the files requested are on the
mounted tape (or a later tape, thus the reverse order) and doesn't
read through the tape if no files are.
If you are working with a single volume dump or the number of files
being restored is large, respond to the query with `1' and
.I restor
will read the tapes in sequential order.
.IP
If you have a hierarchy to restore you can use
.IR dumpdir (8)
to produce the list of names and a shell script to move
the resulting files to their homes.
.TP
.B t
Print the date the tape was written and the date
the filesystem was dumped from.

The
.Fl r
flag precludes an interactive file extraction and can be
detrimental to one's health if not used carefully (not to mention
the disk). An example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs /dev/rrp0g eagle
mount /dev/rp0g /mnt
cd /mnt

restore rf /dev/rst8
.Ed

Note that 
.Nm restore

restore passes.
This file should be removed when the last incremental has been
restored.
.Pp
.Nm Restore ,
in conjunction with
.Xr newfs 8
and
.Xr dump 8 ,
may be used to modify file system parameters
such as size or block size.
.It Fl t
The names of the specified files are listed if they occur
on the backup.
If no file argument is given,
then the root directory is listed,
which results in the entire content of the
backup being listed,
unless the
.Fl h
flag has been specified.
Note that the
.Fl t
flag replaces the function of the old
.Xr dumpdir 8
program.
.ne 1i
.It Fl x
The named files are read from the given media.
If a named file matches a directory whose contents 
are on the backup
and the
.Fl h
flag is not specified,
the directory is recursively extracted.
The owner, modification time,
and mode are restored (if possible).
If no file argument is given,
then the root directory is extracted,
which results in the entire content of the
