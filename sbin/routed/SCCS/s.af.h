c don't rely on AF_MAX (comes from kernel include): check for nil explicitly,
c use our own idea of table size.  Use syslog to (optionally) log bad packets.
c Don't respond to routing inquiries from a router unless we are suppliers
c (really want to respondto everything but broadcasts, but haven't got
c the "to" address.)
