.Nm Routed

is invoked at boot time to manage the network routing tables.
The routing daemon uses a variant of the Xerox NS Routing
Information Protocol in maintaining up to date kernel routing
table entries.

It used a generalized protocol capable of use with multiple
address types, but is currently used only for Internet routing
within a cluster of networks.

conditions is satisfied:
D 7
.TP
(1)
E 7
I 7
.Bl -enum
.It
E 7
No routing table entry exists for the destination network
or host, and the metric indicates the destination is ``reachable''
(i.e. the hop count is not infinite).
D 7
.TP
(2)
E 7
I 7
.It
E 7
The source host of the packet is the same as the router in the
existing routing table entry.  That is, updated information is
being received from the very internetwork router through which
packets for the destination are being routed.
D 7
.TP
(3)
E 7
I 7
.It
E 7
The existing entry in the routing table has not been updated for
some time (defined to be 90 seconds) and the route is at least
as cost effective as the current route.
D 7
.TP
(4)
E 7
I 7
.It
E 7
The new route describes a shorter route to the destination than
the one currently stored in the routing tables; the metric of
the new route is compared against the one stored in the table
to decide this.

E 7
In addition to processing incoming packets,
D 7
.I routed
E 7
I 7
.Nm routed
E 7
also periodically checks the routing table entries.
If an entry has not been updated for 3 minutes, the entry's metric
is set to infinity and marked for deletion.  Deletions are delayed
an additional 60 seconds to insure the invalidation is propagated
D 3
throughout the internet.
E 3
I 3
throughout the local internet.
E 3
D 7
.PP
E 7
I 7
.Pp
E 7
Hosts acting as internetwork routers gratuitously supply their
routing tables every 30 seconds to all directly connected hosts
and networks.
I 3
The response is sent to the broadcast address on nets capable of that function,
to the destination address on point-to-point links, and to the router's
own address on other networks.
The normal routing tables are bypassed when sending gratuitous responses.
The reception of responses on each network is used to determine that the
network and interface are functioning correctly.
If no response is received on an interface, another route may be chosen
to route around the interface, or the route may be dropped if no alternative
is available.

gateways.  When 
D 7

D 7

D 7
only information from the SIOGIFCONF
E 3
.IR ioctl .
E 7
I 7
only information from the
.Dv SIOGIFCONF
.Xr ioctl 2 .
E 7
Gateways specified in this manner should be marked passive
if they are not expected to exchange routing information,
while gateways marked active
should be willing to exchange routing information (i.e.
they should have a
D 7
.I routed
E 7

.Nm routed
E 7
process running on the machine).
D 4
Passive gateways are maintained in the
routing tables forever and information
regarding their existence is included in
E 4
I 4
Routes through passive gateways are installed in the
kernel's routing tables once upon startup.
Such routes are not included in
E 4
any routing information transmitted.
Active gateways are treated equally to network
interfaces.  Routing information is distributed
to the gateway and if no routing information is
D 9
received for a period of the time, the associated
E 9
I 9
received for a period of time, the associated
E 9
route is deleted.

E 4
I 4
Gateways marked

.I external
E 7
I 7
.Em external
E 7
are also passive, but are not placed in the kernel
E 4
routing table nor are they included in routing updates.
The function of external entries is to inform
D 7
.I routed
E 7
I 7
.Nm routed
E 7
that another routing process
will install such a route, and that alternate routes to that destination
should not be installed.
Such entries are only required when both routers may learn of routes
to the same destination.
