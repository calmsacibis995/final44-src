.Nm Savecore
D 11
is meant to be called near the end of the initialization file
.Pa /etc/rc
(see
.Xr rc 8 ) .
Its function
E 8
E 2
is to save the core dump of the system (assuming one was made) and to
write a reboot message in the shutdown log.
E 11
I 11
copies the currently running kernel and its associated core dump into
.Fa directory ,
and enters a reboot message and information about the core dump into
the system log.
E 11
D 8
.PP
Savecore checks the core dump to be certain it corresponds with the
current running unix.  If it does it saves the core image in the file
.IR dirname /vmcore.n
D 5
and it's brother, the namelist,
E 5
I 5
and its brother, the namelist,
E 5
.IR dirname /vmunix.n
The trailing ".n" in the pathnames is replaced by a number which grows
every time
.I savecore
is run in that directory.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width directory
E 11
.It Fl c
D 11
Clears the dump without saving it.
E 11
I 11
Clears the dump, so that future invocations of
.Nm savecore
will ignore it.
E 11
.It Fl f
D 11
Forces a dump to be taken even if the magic number indicates
there isn't a dump.
E 11
I 11
Forces a dump to be taken even if the dump doesn't appear correct or there
is insufficient disk space.
.It Fl N
Use
.Ar system
as the kernel instead of the default ``/vmunix''.
E 11
.It Fl v
D 11

E 11

checks the core dump to be certain it corresponds with the
current running unix.  If the core dump is current, it saves the core
image in
.Ar dirname Ns Pa /vmcore.n
and the namelist
in
.Ar dirname Ns Pa /vmunix.n
Sequence numbers are incremented and appended to the end of the pathnames
each time
E 11
I 11
checks the core dump in various ways to make sure that it is current and
that it corresponds to the currently running system.
If it passes these checks, it saves the core image in
.Ar directory Ns Pa /vmcore.#
and the system in
.Ar directory Ns Pa /vmunix.#
The ``#'' is the number from the first line of the file
.Ar directory Ns Pa /bounds ,
and it is incremented and stored back into the file each time
E 11
.Nm savecore

is run in the directory.

E 3
If the minfree file does not exist, savecore always writes out the core
file (assuming that a core dump was taken).
E 11
I 11
.Nm Savecore
also checks the available disk space before attempting to make the copies.
If there is insufficient disk space in the filesystem containing
.Ar directory ,
or if the file
.Ar directory Ns Pa /minfree
exists and the number of free kilobytes (for non-superusers) in the
filesystem after the copies were made would be less than the number
in the first line of this file, the copies are not attempted.
