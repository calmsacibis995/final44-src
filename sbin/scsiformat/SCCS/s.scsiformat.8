.Sh NAME
.Nm scsiformat
.Nd format SCSI disks and show SCSI parameters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm scsiformat
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl p Ar page-control
.Ar raw-device-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm scsiformat
utility can be used to format SCSI disks
on systems that support on-line SCSI formatting
(currently this is limited to the HP300 and SPARC ports).
It will also show the various parameters set in the SCSI controller.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Modify how the SCSI mode sense page query is constructed.
By default,
.Nm scsiformat
asks for the current settings.
The page-control flag is one of:
.sp
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It Li c
gets current settings.
.It Li d
gets default settings (those provided by the disk's manufacturer).
.It Li s
gets saved settings (those that persist across power cycles).
.It Li v
shows which parameters are variable.
.El
.It Fl r
Don't format, instead display the disk parameters.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
These should mostly be self-explanatory.
A copy of the SCSI standard (or a more readable derivative)
may be useful, however.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm scsiformat
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
