may be the word

(indicating an immediate shutdown)
or specify a future time in one of two formats:

At intervals which get closer together as apocalypse approaches,
warning messages are displayed at the terminals of all users on the
system.  Five minutes before shutdown, or immediately if
shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by
creating
