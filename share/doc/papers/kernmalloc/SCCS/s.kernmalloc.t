.H 1 "Kernel Memory Allocation in 4.3BSD
.PP
The 4.3BSD kernel has at least ten different memory allocators.
I 2
Some of them handle large blocks,
some of them handle small chained data structures,
and others include information to describe I/O operations.
E 2
Often the allocations are for small pieces of memory that are only
needed for the duration of a single system call.
In a user process such short-term
D 3
memory would be allocated on the runtime stack.
Because the kernel has a limited runtime stack,
E 3
I 3
memory would be allocated on the run-time stack.
Because the kernel has a limited run-time stack,
E 3
D 2
it is not feasible to allocate even small blocks of memory on it.
E 2
I 2
it is not feasible to allocate even moderate blocks of memory on it.
E 2
Consequently, such memory must be allocated through a more dynamic mechanism.
For example,
when the system must translate a pathname,
it must allocate a one kilobye buffer to hold the name.
D 3
.PP
E 3
D 2
Other blocks of memory must be more persistent than a single system call,
so really have to be allocated from dynamic memory.
E 2
I 2
Other blocks of memory must be more persistent than a single system call
and really have to be allocated from dynamic memory.
E 2
Examples include protocol control blocks that remain throughout
the duration of the network connection.
.PP
Demands for dynamic memory allocation in the kernel have increased
as more services have been added.
Each time a new type of memory allocation has been required,
a specialized memory allocation scheme has been written to handle it.
Often the new memory allocation scheme has been built on top
of an older allocator.
For example, the block device subsystem provides a crude form of
D 7
memory allocation through the allocation of empty buffers.
E 7
I 7
memory allocation through the allocation of empty buffers [Thompson78].
E 7
The allocation is slow because of the implied semantics of
finding the oldest buffer, pushing its contents to disk if they are dirty,
and moving physical memory into or out of the buffer to create 
D 7
the requested size [Thompson78].
E 7
I 7
the requested size.
E 7
D 2
To reduce the overhead a ``new'' memory allocator is built that
allocates a pool of empty buffers.

Finally, it creates yet another interface of

A generalized memory allocator is needed to reduce the complexity
of writing code inside the kernel.
Rather than providing many semi-specialized ways of allocating memory,
the kernel should provide a single general purpose allocator.
With only a single interface,

programmers need not concern themselves with trying to figure

The design specification for a kernel memory allocator is similar to,
D 3
but not identical with,
the design criterion for a user level memory allocator.
E 3
I 3
but not identical to,
the design criteria for a user level memory allocator.
E 3
The first criterion for a memory allocator is that it make good use
of the physical memory.
Good use of memory is measured by the amount of memory needed to hold
a set of allocations at any point in time.
Percentage utilization is expressed as:
.EQ
D 2
utilization = used over allocated
E 2
I 2
utilization~=~requested over required
E 2
.EN
D 2
Here, ``used'' is the sum of the memory that has been requested
and ``allocated'' is the amount of memory that has been
allocated to the pool from which the requests are filled.
E 2
I 2
Here, ``requested'' is the sum of the memory that has been requested
and not yet freed.
``Required'' is the amount of memory that has been
allocated for the pool from which the requests are filled.
An allocator requires more memory than requested because of fragmentation
D 7
and to have a ready supply of free memory for future requests.
E 7
I 7
and a need to have a ready supply of free memory for future requests.
E 7
E 2
A perfect memory allocator would have a utilization of 100%.
In practice,
having a 50% utilization is considered good [Korn85].
.PP
Good memory utilization in the kernel is more important than
in user processes.
Because user processes run in virtual memory,
unused parts of their address space can be paged out.
D 2
Thus pages that are part of the ``allocated'' pool that are not
being ``used'' need not tie up physical memory.
E 2
I 2
D 3
Thus pages that are part of the ``required'' pool that are not
E 3
I 3
Thus pages in the process address space
that are part of the ``required'' pool that are not
E 3
being ``requested'' need not tie up physical memory.
E 2
Because the kernel is not paged,
D 2
all pages in the ``allocated'' pool are held by the kernel and
E 2
I 2
all pages in the ``required'' pool are held by the kernel and
E 2
cannot be used for other purposes.
D 3
Consequently, it is desirable to keep the utilization percentage
as high as possible.
D 2
It is also desirable to release memory from the ``allocated'' pool
rather than to hold them as is typically done with user processes.
E 2
I 2
It is also desirable to release memory from the ``required'' pool
E 3
I 3
To keep the kernel utilization percentage as high as possible,
it is desirable to release unused memory in the ``required'' pool
E 3
rather than to hold it as is typically done with user processes.
I 3
Because the kernel can directly manipulate its own page maps,
releasing unused memory is fast;
a user process must do a system call to release memory.
E 3
E 2
.PP
The most important criterion for a memory allocator is that it be fast.
D 3
Memory allocation is done frequently,
D 2
so a slow memory allocator will degrade the system performance.
E 2
I 2
as a slow memory allocator will degrade the system performance.
E 2
The kernel is more critical than user processes in this respect
E 3
I 3
Because memory allocation is done frequently,
a slow memory allocator will degrade the system performance.
Speed of allocation is more critical when executing in the
kernel than in user code,
E 3
because the kernel must allocate many data structure that user
D 2
programs would be able to (cheaply) allocate on their runtime stack.
E 2
I 2
D 3
programs would be able to allocate cheaply on their runtime stack.
E 3
I 3
processes can allocate cheaply on their run-time stack.
E 3
E 2
In addition, the kernel represents the platform on which all user
processes run,
D 7
so if it is slow, it will degrade the performance of every process
E 7
I 7
and if it is slow, it will degrade the performance of every process
E 7
that is running.
.PP
Another problem with a slow memory allocator is that programmers
D 2
of frequently used kernel interfaces will feel that they
E 2
I 2
of frequently-used kernel interfaces will feel that they
E 2
cannot afford to use it as their primary memory allocator. 
Instead they will build their own memory allocator on top of the
original by maintaining their own pool of memory blocks.
D 7
Creating such a specialized memory allocator has the 
problem of creating multiple interfaces of which
the programmer must be aware.

the size of the request is rounded up to the next power of two.

Thus, a request for a block of memory of size 53 returns

A typical memory allocation requires a roundup calculation
followed by a linked list removal.
Only if the list is empty is a real memory allocation done.
The free operation is also fast;
the block of memory is put back onto the list from which it came.

There are several special conditions that arise when writing a
memory allocator for the kernel that do not apply to a user process
memory allocator.
First, the maximum memory allocation can be determined at 
the time that the machine is booted.
This number is never more than the amount of physical memory on the machine,
and is typically much less since a machine with all its
D 2
memory dedicated to the operating system is uninteresting to run on.

.PP
Another special condition of the kernel memory allocator is that it
can control its own address space.
Unlike user processes that can only grow and shrink their heap at one end,
the kernel can keep an arena of kernel addresses and allocate
pieces from that arena which it then populates with physical memory.
The effect is much the same as a user process that has parts of
its address space paged out when they are not in use,
except that the kernel can explicitly control the set of pages
allocated to its address space.
The result is that the ``working set'' of pages in use by the
kernel exactly corresponds to the set of pages that it is really using.

Each one of these uses of dynamic memory can be assigned a type.

Small allocations are done using the 4.2BSD power-of-two list strategy;

Instead of storing the size of each piece of memory with the piece itself,

Because the size is not specified when a block of memory is freed,
the allocator must keep track of the sizes of the pieces it has handed out.

Eliminating the cost of the overhead per piece improved utilization
far more than expected.

E 5
.PP
I 5
Quantifying the performance of the allocator is difficult because
it is hard to measure the amount of time spent allocating
and freeing memory in the kernel.
The usual approach is to compile a kernel for profiling
and then compare the running time of the routines that
implemented the old abstraction versus those that implement the new one.
The old routines are difficult to quantify because
individual routines were used for more than one purpose.
For example, the
.RN geteblk
routine was used both to allocate one kilobyte memory blocks
and for its intended purpose of providing buffers to the filesystem.
Differentiating these uses is often difficult.
To get a measure of the cost of memory allocation before
putting in our new allocator,
we summed up the running time of all the routines whose
exclusive task was memory allocation.
To this total we added the fraction
of the running time of the multi-purpose routines that could
clearly be identified as memory allocation usage.
This number showed that approximately three percent of
the time spent in the kernel could be accounted to memory allocation.
.PP
The new allocator is difficult to measure
because the usual case of the memory allocator is implemented as a macro.
Thus, its running time is a small fraction of the running time of the
numerous routines in the kernel that use it.
To get a bound on the cost,
D 7
we changed the macro to always call the memory allocation routine.
E 7
I 7
we changed the macro always to call the memory allocation routine.
E 7
Running in this mode, the memory allocator accounted for six percent
of the time spent in the kernel.
Factoring out the cost of the statistics collection and the
subroutine call overhead for the cases that could
normally be handled by the macro,
we estimate that the allocator would account for
D 7
approximate four percent of time in the kernel.
E 7
I 7
at most four percent of time in the kernel.

These measurements show that the new allocator does not introduce
significant new run-time costs.

Two of the traditional UNIX
memory allocators remain in the current system.
The terminal subsystem uses \fIclist\fP\^s (character lists).
That part of the system is expected to undergo major revision within
the the next year or so, and it will probably be changed to use
\fImbuf\fP\^s as it is merged into the network system.
The other major allocator that remains is
.RN getblk ,
the routine that manages the filesystem buffer pool memory
and associated control information.
Only the filesystem uses
.RN getblk
in the current system;
it manages the constant-sized buffer pool.
We plan to merge the filesystem buffer cache into the virtual memory system's
page cache in the future.
This change will allow the size of the buffer pool to be changed
according to memory load,
but will require a policy for balancing memory needs
with filesystem cache performance.
