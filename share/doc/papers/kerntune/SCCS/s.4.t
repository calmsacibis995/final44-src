Conclusions

We have created a profiler that aids in the evaluation
of the kernel.
For each routine in the kernel,
the profile shows the extent to which that routine
helps support various abstractions,
and how that routine uses other abstractions.
The profile assesses the cost of routines
at all levels of the kernel decomposition.
The profiler is easily used,
and can be compiled into the kernel.
It adds only five to thirty percent execution overhead to the kernel
being profiled,
produces no additional output while the kernel is running
and allows the kernel to be measured in its real environment.
Kernel profiles can be used to identify bottlenecks in performance.
We have shown how to improve performance 
by caching recently calculated name translations.
The combined caches added to the name translation process
reduce the average cost of translating a pathname to an inode by 35%.
These changes reduce the percentage of time spent running
in the system by nearly 9%.

I would like to thank Robert Elz for sharing his ideas and 
his code for cacheing system wide names.
Thanks also to all the users at Berkeley who provided all the
input to generate the kernel profiles.
