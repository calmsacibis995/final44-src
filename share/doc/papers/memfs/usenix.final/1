Subject: USENIX - `instructions' for `A Pageable Memory Based Filesystem'
--------
The paper is submitted with the requested macros. Three additional
macros are used which are defined at the top of the file. The
biographies are placed at the end of the paper as requested, though
I believe that they would be better placed after the body of the
paper and before the appendix.  The comments before each biography
describe where to get the faces from the uunet database. The hardcopy
paper has the appendix run through the `vgrind' preprocessor, though
the paper as submitted uses .DS/.DE surrounding the code. A copy
of the appendix run through `vgrind' has been submitted separately
as a figure should you wish to print it in that form. Should you
need to contact me, I can be reached at 415-843-9535 (home) or
415-642-4948 (work). All authors will be out of town Sunday April
22 until Wednesday April 25 at a POSIX meeting in Utah. I will
leave the hotel phone number with people at both phone numbers above.
