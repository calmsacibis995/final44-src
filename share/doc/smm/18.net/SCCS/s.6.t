The internal structure of the network system is divided into
three layers.  These
layers correspond to the services provided by the socket
abstraction, those provided by the communication protocols,
and those provided by the hardware interfaces.  The communication
protocols are normally layered into two or more individual
cooperating layers, though they are collectively viewed
in the system as one layer providing services supportive
of the appropriate socket abstraction.

those services which are appropriate to support it.  The supporting

Stream-oriented sockets queue data with no addresses, headers
or record boundaries.
The data are in mbufs linked through the \fIm_next\fP field.
Buffers containing access rights may be present within the chain
if the underlying protocol supports passage of access rights.
Record-oriented sockets, including datagram sockets,
queue data as a list of packets; the sections of packets are distinguished
by the types of the mbufs containing them.
The mbufs which comprise a record are linked through the \fIm_next\fP field;
records are linked from the \fIm_act\fP field of the first mbuf
of one packet to the first mbuf of the next.
Each packet begins with an mbuf containing the ``from'' address
if the protocol provides it,
then any buffers containing access rights, and finally any buffers
containing data.
If a record contains no data,
no data buffers are required unless neither address nor access rights
are present.

Each socket is created in a communications domain,

Each interface address has the following form:
.DS
.ta \w'#define 'u +\w'struct   'u +\w'struct   'u +\w'sockaddr ifa_addr;   'u-\w'struct   'u
struct ifaddr {
	struct	sockaddr ifa_addr;	/* address of interface */

};
.ta \w'#define 'u +\w'ifa_broadaddr   'u +\w'ifa_ifu.ifu_broadaddr	   'u
#define	ifa_broadaddr	ifa_ifu.ifu_broadaddr	/* broadcast address */
#define	ifa_dstaddr	ifa_ifu.ifu_dstaddr	/* other end of p-to-p link */
.DE
The protocol generally maintains this structure as part of a larger
structure containing additional information concerning the address.
E 3
.PP
Each interface has a send queue and routines used for 
initialization, \fIif_init\fP, and output, \fIif_output\fP.
If the interface resides on a system bus, the routine \fIif_reset\fP
will be called after a bus reset has been performed. 
An interface may also
D 3
specify a timer routine, \fIif_watchdog\fP, which should be called
every \fIif_timer\fP seconds (if non-zero).
E 3
I 3
specify a timer routine, \fIif_watchdog\fP;
if \fIif_timer\fP is non-zero, it is decremented once per second
until it reaches zero, at which time the watchdog routine is called.
E 3
.PP
The state of an interface and certain characteristics are stored in
the \fIif_flags\fP field.  The following values are possible:
.DS
._d
#define	IFF_UP	0x1	/* interface is up */
D 3
#define	IFF_BROADCAST	0x2	/* broadcast address valid */
E 3
I 3
#define	IFF_BROADCAST	0x2	/* broadcast is possible */
E 3
#define	IFF_DEBUG	0x4	/* turn on debugging */
D 3
#define	IFF_ROUTE	0x8	/* routing entry installed */
E 3
I 3
#define	IFF_LOOPBACK	0x8	/* is a loopback net */
E 3
#define	IFF_POINTOPOINT	0x10	/* interface is point-to-point link */
#define	IFF_NOTRAILERS	0x20	/* avoid use of trailers */
#define	IFF_RUNNING	0x40	/* resources allocated */
#define	IFF_NOARP	0x80	/* no address resolution protocol */
.DE
If the interface is connected to a network which supports transmission
of \fIbroadcast\fP packets, the IFF_BROADCAST flag will be set and
D 3
the \fIif_broadaddr\fP field will contain the address to be used in
E 3
I 3
the \fIifa_broadaddr\fP field will contain the address to be used in
E 3
sending or accepting a broadcast packet.  If the interface is associated
D 3
with a point to point hardware link (for example, a DEC DMR-11), the
IFF_POINTOPOINT flag will be set and \fIif_dstaddr\fP will contain the
E 3
I 3
with a point-to-point hardware link (for example, a DEC DMR-11), the
IFF_POINTOPOINT flag will be set and \fIifa_dstaddr\fP will contain the
E 3
address of the host on the other side of the connection.  These addresses
and the local address of the interface, \fIif_addr\fP, are used in
filtering incoming packets.  The interface sets IFF_RUNNING after
it has allocated system resources and posted an initial read on the
device it manages.  This state bit is used to avoid multiple allocation
requests when an interface's address is changed.  The IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag indicates the interface should refrain from using a \fItrailer\fP
D 3
encapsulation on outgoing packets; \fItrailer\fP protocols are described
E 3
I 3
encapsulation on outgoing packets, or (where per-host negotiation
of trailers is possible) that trailer encapsulations should not be requested;
\fItrailer\fP protocols are described
E 3
in section 14.  The IFF_NOARP flag indicates the interface should not
use an ``address resolution protocol'' in mapping internetwork addresses
to local network addresses.
.PP
D 3
The information stored in an \fIifnet\fP structure for point to point
communication devices is not currently used by the system internally.
Rather, it is used by the user level routing process in determining
host network connections and in initially devising routes (refer to
chapter 10 for more information).
.PP
E 3
Various statistics are also stored in the interface structure.  These
may be viewed by users using the \fInetstat\fP(1) program.
.PP
The interface address and flags may be set with the SIOCSIFADDR and
D 3
SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctls.  SIOCSIFADDR is used to initially define each
E 3
I 3
SIOCSIFFLAGS \fIioctl\fP\^s.  SIOCSIFADDR is used initially to define each
E 3
interface's address; SIOGSIFFLAGS can be used to mark
an interface down and perform site-specific configuration.
I 3
The destination address of a point-to-point link is set with SIOCSIFDSTADDR.
Corresponding operations exist to read each value.
Protocol families may also support operations to set and read the broadcast
address.
In addition, the SIOCGIFCONF \fIioctl\fP retrieves a list of interface
names and addresses for all interfaces and protocols on the host.
E 3
.NH 3
UNIBUS interfaces
.PP
All hardware related interfaces currently reside on the UNIBUS.
Consequently a common set of utility routines for dealing
with the UNIBUS has been developed.  Each UNIBUS interface
utilizes a structure of the following form:
.DS
D 3
.if t .ta .5i 1.25i 2.8i
.if n .ta .7i 1.75i 3.8i
E 3

The \fIif_ubinfo\fP structure contains the general information needed

In addition, there is a structure describing each buffer, including
UNIBUS resources held by the interface.
Sufficient memory pages and bus map registers are allocated to each buffer
upon initialization according to the maximum packet size and header length.
The kernel virtual address of the buffer is held in \fIifrw_addr\fP,

\fIif_ubaminit\fP allocates resources on UNIBUS adapter \fIuban\fP,

The \fIifr\fP and \fIifx\fP parameters are pointers to arrays

are \fInr\fP and \fInx\fP, respectively.
\fIif_ubainit\fP is a simpler, backwards-compatible interface used
for hardware with single buffers of each type.
They are called only at boot time or after a UNIBUS reset. 
One data path (buffered or unbuffered,
depending on the \fIifu_flags\fP field) is allocated for each buffer.
The \fInmr\fP parameter indicates
E 3
the number of UNIBUS mapping registers required to map a maximal
sized packet onto the UNIBUS, while \fIhlen\fP specifies the size
of a local network header, if any, which should be mapped separately
from the data (see the description of trailer protocols in chapter 14).
Sufficient UNIBUS mapping registers and pages of memory are allocated
to initialize the input data path for an initial read.  For the output
data path, mapping registers and pages of memory are also allocated
and mapped onto the UNIBUS.  The pages associated with the output
data path are held in reserve in the event a write requires copying
non-page-aligned data (see \fIif_wubaput\fP below).
