This update to the 4.3 distribution of April 1986 provides
substantially improved functionality, security, and standardization,
a Sun-compatible Network Filesystem (NFS),
a new virtual memory implementation based on Carnegie-Mellon's MACH, and
the addition of ISO networking protocols to the set of networking domains.
It adds support for several new architectures including
SPARC-based Sparcstations 1 and 2,
MIPS-based Decstation 3100 and 5000 and Sony NEWS,
68000-based Hewlett-Packard 9000/300 and Omron Luna, and
386-based Personal Computers.
.LP
We were greatly assisted by the recent employees of the
Computer Systems Research Group: Mike Karels, Marc Tietelbaum,
and Keith Sklower.
Our distribution coordinator, Pauline Schwartz,
has reliably managed the finances
and the mechanics of gettings distributions shipped for
nearly the entire fourteen years of the group's existence.
However, the vast majority of the distribution comes from the
numerous people in the UNIX community
that provided their time and energy in creating
the software contributed to this release.
We dedicate this distribution to them.
.LP
This distribution is the last
that will be done by the Computer Systems Research
Group at the University of California at Berkeley.

We acknowledge the following three people for ensuring that
the group did not continue past its prime:

Steve Squires, Program Manager for the
Defense Advance Research Projects Agency, and
Sanford Tannenbaum, Executive Vice President and General Counsel for
UNIX Systems Laboratories.

This update to the 4.2 distribution of August 1983 provides
substantially improved performance, reliability, and security,
the addition of Xerox Network System (NS) to the set of networking domains,
and partial support for the VAX 8600 and MICROVAXII.
.LP
We were greatly assisted by the DEC UNIX Engineering group who
provided two full time employees, Miriam Amos and Kevin Dunlap,
to work at Berkeley. They were responsible for developing and
debugging the distributed domain based name server
and integrating it into the mail system.
Mt Xinu provided the bug list distribution service as well as

George Goble was invaluable in shaking out the bugs on his
production systems long before we were confident enough to
inflict it on our users.
Bill Shannon at Sun Microsystems has been helpful in

This update to the 4.1 distribution of June 1981 provides support
for the VAX 11/730, full networking and interprocess communication
support, an entirely new file system, and many other new features.
It is certainly the most ambitious release of software ever prepared
here and represents many man-years of work.
Bill Shannon (both at DEC and at Sun Microsystems)
and Robert Elz of the University
of Melbourne contributed greatly to this distribution
through new device drivers and painful debugging episodes.
Rob Gurwitz of BBN wrote the initial version of the code upon
which the current networking support is based.
Eric Allman of Britton-Lee donated countless hours to the mail system.
Bill Croft (both at SRI and Sun Microsystems) aided in the
debugging and development of the networking facilities.
Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories also
contributed greatly to this distribution, providing
valuable advise and guidance.  Helge Skrivervik
worked on the device drivers which enabled
the distribution to be delivered with a TU58
console cassette and RX01 console flopppy disk, and
rewrote major portions of the standalone i/o system
to support formatting of non-DEC peripherals.
.LP
Numerous others contributed their time and energy in organizing
the user software for release, while many groups of people on
campus suffered patiently through the low spots of development.
As always, we are grateful to the UNIX user community for 
encouragement and support.

Once again, the financial support of the Defense Advanced Research

the VAX 11/780.  Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne
contributed greatly to this distribution especially in the boot-time
system configuration code; Bill Shannon
of DEC supplied us with the implementation of DEC standard bad block handing.
The research group at Bell Laboratories and DEC Merrimack provided us with
access to 11/750's in order to debug its support.

This manual reflects the Berkeley system mid-October, 1980.
A large amount of tuning has been done in the system since the last release;
we hope this provides as noticeable an improvement for you as it did for us.
This release finds the system in transition; a number of facilities
have been added in experimental versions (job control, resource limits)
and the implementation of others is imminent (shared-segments, higher
performance from the file system, etc.).
Applications which use facilities that are in transition should be aware
that some of the system calls and library routines will change
in the near future.  We have tried to be conscientious and make it
very clear where this is likely.

A new group has been formed
at Berkeley, to assume responsibility for the future
development and support of a version of UNIX on the VAX.
The group has received funding from the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
to supply a standard version of the system to DARPA contractors.
The same version of the system will be made available to other licensees
of UNIX on the VAX for a duplication charge.
We gratefully acknowledge
the support of this contract.
.LP
We wish to acknowledge the contribution of a number of individuals to
the the system.
.LP
We would especially like to thank
Jim Kulp of IIASA,
Laxenburg Austria and his colleagues,
who first put job control facilities into UNIX;
Eric Allman, Robert Henry, Peter Kessler and Kirk McKusick, who
contributed major new pieces of software;
Mark Horton, who contributed to the improvement of facilities and
substantially improved the quality of our bit-mapped fonts,
our hardware support staff:
Bob Kridle,
Anita Hirsch,
Len Edmondson
and
Fred Archibald,
who helped us to debug a number of new peripherals;
Ken Arnold who did much of the leg-work in getting this version of the
manual prepared, and did the final editing of sections 2-6,
some special individuals within Bell Laboratories:
Greg Chesson,
Stuart Feldman,
Dick Haight,
Howard Katseff,
Brian Kernighan,
Tom London,
John Reiser,
Dennis Ritchie,
Ken Thompson,
and
Peter Weinberger
who helped out by answering questions;
our excellent local DEC field service people,
Kevin Althaus and Frank Chargois
who kept our machine running virtually all the time, and fixed it quickly
when things broke;
and,
Mike Accetta of Carnegie-Mellon University,
Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne,
George Goble of Purdue University,
and
David Kashtan of the Stanford Research Institute
for their technical advice and support.

This manual reflects the state of the Berkeley system, December 1979.
We would like to thank all the people at Berkeley who have contributed to
the system, and particularly thank
Prof. Richard Fateman for creating and administrating a hospitable environment,
Mark Horton who helped prepare this manual, and
Eric Allman, Bob Kridle, Juan Porcar
and Richard Tuck for their contributions to the kernel.

The cooperation of Bell Laboratories in providing us with an early version of
\s-2UNIX\s0/32V is greatly appreciated.  We would especially like to thank
Dr. Charles Roberts of Bell Laboratories for helping us obtain this release,
and acknowledge
T. B. London,
J. F. Reiser,
K. Thompson,
D. M. Ritchie,
G. Chesson and
H. P. Katseff
for their advice and support.
