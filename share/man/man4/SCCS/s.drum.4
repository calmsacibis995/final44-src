.Sh DESCRIPTION
E 4
This file refers to the paging device in use by the system.
This may actually be a subdevice of one of the disk drivers, but in
a system with paging interleaved across multiple disk drives
it provides an indirect driver for the multiple drives.

or so,
and since the system never allocates blocks across the boundary,
this is usually not a problem.
