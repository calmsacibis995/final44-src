If port 0 does not have the need for modem control then flags can be specified

as 0xf.

Interrupts happen on a per character basis unless the interrupt
rate for the card reaches 70 interrupts per second at which time the
driver changes to a 16.7ms (60 interrupts per second) polling scheme until 
the interrupt rate drops.
