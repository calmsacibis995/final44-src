Each of the host's network addresses

is specified at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR
ioctl.  The

E 2
I 2

The

interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
D 2
.IR arp (4P)

The use of ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying data on
input and output is supported by the interface but offers no advantage
D 2
due to the large HP page size.
The use of trailers is negotiated with ARP.

I 2
due to the large

The use of trailers is negotiated with

E 2
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,

by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
