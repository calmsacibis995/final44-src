.Cd "master hpib? at scode?"
.Cd "disk rd? at hpib? slave?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a generic
.Tn CS/80
disk driver.
Only a small number of possible
.Tn CS/80
drives are supported,
E 2
but others can easily be added by adding tables to the driver.
D 2
.PP
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``rd'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
The block files access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
E 2
I 2
It is a typical block-device driver; see
.Xr physio 4 .
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the
.Nm rd
special files; consult
.Xr mknod 8
if a special file needs to be made manually.
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
E 2
The driver interrogates the controller
to determine the type of drive attached.
The driver recognizes the following drives:

E 2
not all of which have been tested.
D 2
The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:

7945/7946 partitions:
	disk	start	length	cyls
E 2
I 2
Special file names begin with
.Sq Li rd
and
.Sq Li rrd
for the block and character files respectively. The second
component of the name, a drive unit number in the range of zero to
seven, is represented by a
.Sq Li ?
in the disk layouts below. The last component of the name is the
file system partition
and is designated
by a letter from
.Sq Li a
to
.Sq Li h
which also corresponds to a minor device number sets: zero to seven,
eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for drive zero, drive two and drive
three respectively
(see physio 4 ) .
