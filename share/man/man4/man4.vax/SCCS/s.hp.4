.SH DESCRIPTION
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``hp'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.

The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:

The block file's access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'

Likewise

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "disk hp0 at mba0 drive 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hp
driver
is a generic Massbus disk driver which handles both the standard
.Tn DEC
controllers and the Emulex
.Tn SC750
and
.Tn SC780
controllers.
It is typical of a block-device disk driver; block
.Tn I/O
is
described in
.Xr physio 4 .
.Pp
The script
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
should be used to create the special files; if a special file
needs to be created by hand consult
.Xr mknod 8 .
It is recommended as a security precaution to not create special files
for devices which may never be installed.
.Pp
E 7
The first sector of each disk contains both a first-stage bootstrap program
and a disk label containing geometry information and partition layouts (see
D 7
.IR disklabel (5).
E 7
I 7
.Xr disklabel 5 .
E 7
This sector is normally write-protected, and disk-to-disk copies should
avoid copying this sector.
The label may be updated with
D 7
.IR disklabel (8),
E 7
I 7
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
E 7
which can also be used to write-enable and write-disable the sector.
The next 15 sectors contain a second-stage bootstrap program.

D 7
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
This driver handles both standard DEC controllers and Emulex
D 6
SC750 and SC780 controllers.  Standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register.  For
the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
E 6
I 6
SC750 and SC780 controllers.
E 7
I 7
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
This driver handles both standard
.Tn DEC
controllers and Emulex
.Tn SC750
and
.Tn SC780
controllers.
E 7
During autoconfiguration or whenever a drive comes on line for the first time,
D 7
as well as when a drive is opened after all partitions are closed,
E 7
I 7
or when a drive is opened after all partitions are closed,
E 7
the first sector of the drive is examined for a disk label.
If a label is found, the geometry of the drive and the partition tables
are taken from it.
If no label is found,
D 7
standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register,
E 7
I 7
standard
.Tn DEC
drive types are
recognized according to the
.Tn MASSBUS
drive type register,
E 7
and default partitions are used.
For the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
E 6
D 7
to indicate the drive is an RM02.  When this is encountered,
E 7
I 7
to indicate the drive is an
.Tn RM02 .
When this is encountered,
E 7
the driver checks the holding register to find out
the disk geometry and, based on this information, decides what
D 7
the drive type is.  The following disks are supported: RM03,
RM05, RP06, RM80, RP05, RP07, ML11A, ML11B, CDC 9775, CDC 9730,
AMPEX Capricorn (32 sectors/track), FUJITSU Eagle (48 sectors/track),

E 7
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified
filesystem block number,
which is a logical block number on the indicated partition.
If the transfer involved multiple blocks, the block range is printed as well.
The parenthesized fields list the actual disk sector number
relative to the beginning of the drive,
as well as the cylinder, track and sector number of the block.

The MASSBUS status register is printed in hexadecimal and

In raw I/O
.I read

truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and

scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.I read, write
and
.IR lseek (2)
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.

The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
