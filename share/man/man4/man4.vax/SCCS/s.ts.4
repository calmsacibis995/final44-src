.It ts%d: no write ring.
An attempt was made to write on the tape drive
E 4
when no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of
the user who tried to access the tape.

status register 0 is printed in octal and symbolically
E 4
decoded as bits.

.SH BUGS
If any non-data error is encountered on non-raw tape, it refuses to do anything
more until closed.

The device lives at the same address as a tm-11

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.1 .
.Sh BUGS
May hang ungracefully if a physical error (non-data) occurs.
.Pp
The device lives at the same address as a
.Tn TM-11
.Pq Xr tm 4 ;
E 4
as it is very difficult to get this device to interrupt, a generic
D 4
system assumes that a ts is present whenever no tm-11 exists but
the csr responds and a ts-11 is configured.
D 2
This does no harm as long as a non-existant ts-11 is not accessed.
.PP
The system should remember which controlling terminal has the tape drive
open and write error messages to that terminal rather than on the console.
