It will print 132 characters per line in print mode

In plot mode, the Benson-Varian prints one raster line at a time.
An entire raster line of bits (2112 bits = 264 bytes) is sent, and
then the Benson-Varian advances to the next raster line.

Nulls can be used in print mode to pad to an even number of bytes.

.I /dev/va0
if there is a daemon active.
E 5
I 5
.Pa /dev/va0
if there is an daemon active.
E 5
D 2
You can see if there is a daemon active by doing a
.IR ps (1),
or by looking in the directory
.I /usr/spool/vad.
If there is a file
.I lock
there, then there is probably a daemon
.IR /usr/lib/vad
running.
If not, you should remove the
.I lock.

In any case, when your program tries to open the device
.I /dev/va0
you may get one of two errors.
The first of these
ENXIO
indicates that the Benson-Varian is already in use.
Your program can then
.IR sleep (2)
and try again in a while, or give up.
The second is
EIO
and indicates that the Benson-Varian is offline.

When you finish using the Benson-Varian in plot mode you should advance to

If you use the standard I/O library with the Benson-Varian you
.B must
do
.IP
setbuf(vp, vpbuf);
.PP
where
.I vpbuf
is declared
.IP
\fBchar\fR vpbuf[BUFSIZ];
.PP
otherwise the standard I/O library, thinking that the Benson-Varian
is a terminal (since it is a character special file) will not adequately buffer
the data you are sending to the Benson-Varian.
This will cause it to run
.B extremely
slowly and tend to grind the system to a halt.
