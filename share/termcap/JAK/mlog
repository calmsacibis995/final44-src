Hi Jason,

Yes I agree.  Just fixed it.
How's it going anyway? Are you still at Schlumberger?

This all sounds very plausible for the h1500, and I'm sure there's a problem,
but I hesitate to make these changes until you can confirm a few points:

(a) I don't think we can count on the high-order bit going away since the
the termcap routines don't, in fact, do it.  The terminal driver may do it,
but since I don't have an h1500 to test, I would like you to make sure at
least that it works under 4.3BSD.

(b) Can you convince me that the output values are going to be safe?

> 	:cm=~^Q%r%>^^ %+`%+`:

It seems to me that if you give the numbers 0 and 0137 to this string,
you output 0140 and 0137 (=137+40+140-200), both of which you claim are
unsafe.

(c) Why do you adjust the range of only one of the numbers?

(d) Assuming the range is safe, how is it correct?  If tgoto() puts out
(0,0) with the original cm string and (0140,0140) with the new one, does
the cursor move the the same spot?

(e) How likely is the average user to be stung by this?

I have the same reservations for this new entry, and I would also prefer
to have it first-hand or from someone who is using that terminal.

I can believe that it wasn't in Ultrix 2.0 since DEC doesn't pay me.
It may have been removed from 4.? BSD as an oversight once, but it's
back again now.

My comments are a combination of my opinion and comments made by reuss@umd5.
You're right, as far as I can see (I have source viewing privileges) the
high bit doesn't get removed in libtermlib.

My experience is using both terminals over an ISN and through a terminal
access controller. I can assure you that neither terminal works reliably
over the ISN without the termcaps I sent you.

I do know first-hand that they work, and do so reliably. The comment about
the H1500 not liking \127 is from my terminal manual. I expect the manual
may be in error, as the termcap works.

> (c) Why do you adjust the range of only one of the numbers?

The second range for both (x,y) values is not precisely the same.

For the Hazel, yes. The manual states the cursor will go to the same spot
for more than one value. I don't have the manual in my hand at this moment,
but I do remember that more than one set of values is listed to address
the cursor. Only one of the possible sets of input values is returned by
the report cursor position function, however.

The University was using Sytek multiplexors, and I was having a hell-of-a-time
getting those Mimes to work. I eventually gave up, until reuss@umd5 found the
fix. Since then, I've used the termcap and the University has changed to an
ISN, which will break the same way the Sytek did with the old termcap.

reuss@umd5 actually gets paid by the Computer Center here, I'm not -- I thought
you might be interested in knowing that .. not certain you might, though ...

EMACS, vi, and anything I wrote that used curses all led to problems. The
Syteks had flow control enabled, and always thought the machine sending the
^S meant to shut the terminal up.

My ugly, ugly kludge was to make a program that sat in the background and sent
a ^Q every so often .. Kept the terminal from getting locked, but apparently
some other CTRL chars were getting swallowed by the Sytek. I gave up cause the
kludge was ugly, and it still didn't get curses stuff to work all the time.

You're very welcome.

The so= and se= entries are commented out because invariably the Mime would
get things reversed after a couple intensity changes.

Besides, the dim text is really dim -- for all practical purposes it's
unreadable. Yes, it's that dim, even after turning up the brightness just
short of excessive defocussing (sp?) with "normal" intensity text.

ic= is removed because of flow control troubles (see above). I don't
remember why I removed ip= anymore ...

No, it can't. But it must receive them if cursor addressing is going to work.

As for typing ~'s (or ~'s in regular text), it works, but the immediately
following char is not displayed. Interesting things happen, of course, when
valid cursor sequences are echoed back to the terminal. I don't remember it
ever happening except when I did it on purpose.

Yes, the entries make the so= the brightest (Hazel. calls it "foreground text")
chars the terminal will produce (there are only two brightnesses .. nothing
unusual about that ...)

I couldn't describe what it'll look like in reverse video mode (set by a DIP
switch), 'cause I never used rev. video regularly. I could trot out my old
terminal if you're interested at all ..

respond.  Unfortunately, even a useful entry such as this is just too
special purpose and rare for me to justify incorporating it given the
volume of stuff people send in for us to consider.

This entry is for a supposed VIDEX clone which nonetheless does not support
cursor addressing correctly (bad hardware? maybe), and uses different so and se
codes than the standard "videx" entry.

Thanks for your suggestions about Wyse termcap entries and sorry for
the delay in responding.  We've received a number of submissions for
the Wyse 60, but since I don't have access to one, I have little or
no way of arbitrating between them.

Would you please help me by sharing with me your experiences using the
termcap entries below?  There are four groups, distinguished by using
temporary two letter names beginning with four different letters:

	w?	from Steve Van Domelen (Wyse Tech, svd@bigboy.wyse.com)
	x?	from Douglas Good (doug@cli.com)
	y?	from vojta@math.berkeley.edu
	z?	Current (old) entry (included for completeness)

Which set of entries do you find best?

Thanks for your suggestions about Wyse termcap entries and sorry for
the delay in responding.  We've received a number of submissions for
the Wyse 60, but since I don't have access to one, I have little or
no way of arbitrating between them.

Would you please help me by sharing with me your experiences using the
termcap entries below?  There are four groups, distinguished by using
temporary two letter names beginning with four different letters:

Subject: Re: New termcap entry for Wyse 99GT

Thanks for your suggestions about Wyse termcap entries and sorry for
the delay in responding.  We've received three submissions for the
Wyse 99, but since I don't have access to one, I have little or no
way of arbitrating between them.

Would you please help me by sharing with me your experiences using the
termcap entries below?  There are three groups, distinguished by using
temporary two letter names beginning with different letters:

	w?	from Steve Van Domelen (Wyse Tech, svd@bigboy.wyse.com)
	x?	from pett@cgl.ucsf.edu
	y?	RPC Rodgers (rodgers@maxwell.mmwb.ucsf.edu)

Which set of entries do you find best?

I was hoping you could help me decide about the Wyse 99 as well.
We've received three submissions for the Wyse 99, but again since

Would you mind comparing the enclosed termcaps?  There are three

Rick,

Here are our new wyse 60 entries, though I think you only need the
wy60 entry to test the wy99 stuff.  Thanks very much for all your

I've added your Wyse 100 entry to our termcap file as we had none
before, but I wasn't able to justify adding the two special-purpose
emacs terminals due to our attempts to restrict termcap growth.

Thanks for your wyse99gt termcap entry.  I've added it to the master

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I have been trying to resolve
several conflicting submissions for the Wyse 60.  The new basic entry uses
24 lines, and we now have entries for different combinations of 132 column
and 43 line displays.

	Sorry for the double posting,
I am still new to termcap writing, and was only forced into it
by the acquisiotio of a new terminal.  Anyway the second posting 
corrects one error, and removes the codes sent by function keys,
since these are programmable, also I have now had a chance to look
at 4.3 documentation ( I am on a 4.2( Really SUNOS3.4 ) system ) and
I realize that my posting does quite conform to the specs wrt naming
and obsolete features, etc.  The delays are still not foolproof, and
at 19200 baud ( though not at any lower baud rates ) emacs occasionally
gets out of sync with the screen, ( there are no problems with vi ).

      I may send a letter to hp asking for the correct delay values,
if this results in a more reliable entry, I may send a third version,
so the second one perhaps ought to contain a warning about bugs
at 19200baud and higher.

---Sorry about the mess.

I've added your AT&T 6386 termcap to BSD.  It's the one you posted
to comp.unix.{wizards,questions} back in Sept. 1988 I think.  Please
let me know if you have anything that works better.

PS.  Here's what I added:

# AT&T 6386 decompiled and hacked from SVR3.1 terminfo
# From: caron@polya.Stanford.EDU (Ilan G. Caron)
# Problems:  (1) The mode lines are screwed up - they're not in standout
# (an extraneous ESC-RD sequence is prepended to each mode line).
# (2) Cursor addressing into the mode line is often off-by-one,
# in particular, when the percentage indicator is updated.
# (3) When reverting to a single window (C-x 1), the display
# needs refreshing (an extraneous ESC-S seems to be generated).
# (The above 3 might be manifestations of the same problem).
# (4) Deletes sometime don't, especially when done fast - does this
# suggest that I need to pad something?

The Tektronix 4025 is undoubtedly one of the most poorly-designed
terminals of all time.  What happens on its display is dependent
on what you're doing on the keyboard!  This makes effective full-
duplex use virtually impossible.

>1)  Dose anyone have a termcap for one of these?

# Tektronix 4025A
# The following status modes are assumed for normal operation (replace the

#	^]ECH R
#	^]EOL
#	^]RSS T
#	^]SNO N
#	^]STO 9 17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73
# Other modes may be set according to communication requirements.

# Clear-to-end-of-display emulation via !DLI 988 is too groady to use, alas.

#
#	The Hewlett Packard HP110A has a screen of 16 lines, 
#	which moves as a window over a screen buffer of 48 lines. 
#	This caused some problems since the line numbers on the
#	screen are not fixed. The idea of the description, given
#	below, is that only line 1 through 16 of the screen buffer 
#	are used. In this way it is possible to guarantee that 
#	cursor positioning will be performed correctly. 
#
#	There are some entries, that are effected by the solution
#	of the above mentioned problem. The most important one is 
#	the entry "sf". This entry specifies the scroll forward
#	operation ( to the HP110 known as "roll up" ). If the 
#	"roll up"-sequence is used, the screen of the HP110 will
#	move over the screen buffer and consequently, the line numbering 
#	will no longer be correct. Instead the following actions are
#	prescribed :
#
#		1) store the cursor position ( to be used when 
#		   returning to the position where a line has to 
#		   be added );
#		2) send the cursor home;
#		3) delete the first line from the display ( this
#		   causes a scroll up of the lines below );
#		4) restore the cursor position;
#		5) clear till the end of the screen buffer ( no 
#		   residues of earlier actions will appear on the 
#		   screen ).
#
#	One of the things you should not do is specifying the entry ll.
#	If you specify this entry, then vi will use it. The HP110
#	however starts moving over the screen buffer, so line
#	numbering will be incorrect.
#
#	For newer versions of the HP110, the li entry should be
#	modified to correspond with the actual number of lines.

Hi,
  
  Included is the repaired vt200gen termcap entry for 4.3BSD.
  The original was broken.  i.e. in 'vi', if you typed 'dd'
  to delete a single line, the screen would scroll up 14 lines
  from the current line leaving a 14 line gap in the display.
  (ctrl-R to refresh would fix the display).  The problem was
  that the termcap 'dl' entry isn't required by vt200 type
  terminals.  The version given below works.
 
  (p.s. - I've includeed the termcap entry I've written for
  the Northwest Digital Systems Graphics Plus 220 - 4.3BSD 
  doesn't have one)

Have a good one!

I don't recognize that particular message.  If it had said

	Type apollo_15_color unknown

I would have said that the termcap file you saw it in is not the one that
tset is searching.  The default is /etc/termcap, but tset first looks at
TERMCAP to see if it specifies a full name -- if so, it uses that file
instead.

I can't really advise you here because my version of termcap has only four
apollo entries, and nothing for aT or apollo_15_color.

There are fields that aren't defined in any documentation that I have,
but it does look like :dn should be :do.

Looks that way to me.

I changed them all to dN#.  Just for grins I looked and found a

Dunno.  It could have been someone trying to comment out the field,
though that's usually done with something like :.se=.  In any case,
it seems to work with or without the '?'.  I took them out.

Thanks for the corrections, Mike.  Feel free to comb through termcap
for errors.  I don't have time for it, but someone ought to write a
few syntax checkers for termcap entries.

Subject: TEC Model 70
Status: RO

[ Never heard back from Keith Bostic on this one. ]

Enclosed are a working termcap entry and a modified tgoto.c for the
TEC Model 70 terminal.

The terminal is built by an outfit in Arizona, and sold primarily to
OEMs.  For example, all Harris terminals were once TECs, althought that
is no longer the case.  It is a reasonably bright terminal, with screen
dumps and the like; its one major flaw is that cursor positioning
requires the 1's complement of the row and column number.  The termcap
entry I'm sending has been in use for a long time, and works.  It uses a
%m in the cursor positioning; this is to get the 1's complement.  The
tgoto.c I'm sending is able to interpret the %m.  The coding was chosen
to be compatible with the tgoto.c distributed with GNU Emacs.

Sorry for the very long delay in replying to your termcap submissions.
I've added your Apple Lisa entries with a few changes:  changed :dn to
:do and compressed the liswb to include lisa via :tc=.  The Mac entry
didn't seem as robust as what we already had.  Thanks for your interest,

Here are a few termcaps that I like to use that may be useful enough to
include in the standard termcap file. All use half-intensity for "normal"
text and full-intensity for "highlighted" text. The exception is vt100-avo,
which also uses underscore in addition to "bold" for underscored material.
I wrote all these; if you have any question, feel free to ask away.

I'm unable actually to add the entry to any systems but okeeffe, but
once that's done, a special request to Bob Henry (rwh@okeeffe) will
get it copied to your machines.

But before any of that can happen, I need to feel more confident about
the entry.  As you submitted it, it's pretty non-standard.  Here's the
same thing, only reformatted.  I need someone to test it and I'd like
to know that it has the blessing of the Sprite folks.  Would you be able
to help out with that?

Hi Roger,

I've added the new hft entry, and will give the latest termcap file to
Fran sometime soon for /usr/new.  CCS probably will support termcap
again soon, as I'm running out of time and energy.

John,

As the "unofficial" termcap maintainer of CCS systems, I am passing

(P.S. Doesn't CCS support termcap?)

As others have already said, the problem with this is most likely due to
the other machines not knowing how to generate escape sequences to drive
the HFT on the AIX machine.  You have to create a file on each of the unix
machines that tells it how to generate escape sequences for your HFTs.  For
BSD-based unix systems (like Suns), you'll need to add a termcap entry for
HFT.  Below is one that I'm using on a 4.3Tahoe Vax.

Thanks for your submission and sorry for the very long delay in
responding.  You may have seen a network posting with a fairly
elaborate termcap for the hft.  We decided to install that one,
mostly under the assumption that more is better than less.

Would you please let me know if you have any problems with the
following entry that you didn't have with your entry above (I
have no way of testing this myself)?  Thanks,

We don't have anything for the adds viewpoint/3a plus.  For what it's worth,
I'm enclosing all the adds entries we do have.

I don't know any algorithms.  Most people just arrive at value through
experimentation.

The :ct capability is string-valued and stands for "Clear all tab stops."

Yes, you can get version 5.65 dated 3/24/90 from jade.berkeley.edu via
anonymous ftp.  It's in etc/termcap.

Your message was forwarded to me by Keith, as I've been dealing with
(or putting off at very low priority, actually) termcap stuff.  Sorry
for the long time in responding.

As I see it, it's fairly presumptuous of termcap(5) to say what will
and will not take padding.  I would guess that its view of capabilities
just reflects vi's view.  The fact is that any string you hand to tputs()
will be checked for an initial digit string and use it for padding
regardless of what termcap(5) says.  Perhaps the P in the notes column
of the man page should just come out.  Keith?

The way I see it, you are either outputting the ce and cm strings without
stripping off the numeric delays (tputs() interprets them for you), or
you are using the wrong termcap entry.  I suspect the latter, since the
vt100 is a very time-tested entry and your SUN probably would work better

I've just found a very old message of yours in what appears to be a
file of unanswered termcap mail probably overlooked by the person who
was maintaining termcap a few years ago.

If it's not too late for a response to be useful, I would say that I
know of no attempt on the part of Berkeley to conform to RFC1010 as
far as terminal types are concerned.  There is a tendency for names
to be kept in lower-case (unlike the RFC) so that, coincidentally,
our dec-vt100 terminal conforms to the RFC except for the case, while
the other terminal names are more widely divergent.  I don't believe
there are any plans to change the names, especially since the RFC
covers only a small subset of the terminals we have.

  During a process of writing a TELNET client I've found that TermCap file
doesn't have the entries names which are specified by RFC-1010. Unix's
TelNet server requests the client to send the terminal type. According
to RFC-1010, a VT100 terminal (for example) should be sent as DEC-VT100.
However, when I send this string it is not found in termcap, and I can't
use VI or other utilities. I think that termcap should be corrected to
conform with the relevant RFCs.

Gentlemen,

The following is an Amiga termcap which I have developed with the
assistance of the Amiga users on UseNet. The file is actually what I send
when I receive a request for the Amiga termcap, I thought the explainations
may be of use so I left them in.

This particular termcap has been in use for some time without any
complaints, so I figure it is at least fairly usable. The Amiga Ansi termcap
shipped with Sun BSD contains a few errors.

Please send questions to:

Thank You

-------------------  Start of Amiga Termcap Mailer  ------------------

Here is the latest version of my Amiga termcap file.

Thanks to Ross Bogue and a couple of others for a few inspirations.

Added a few more entries, converted caret-type control sequence (^x) entries
to '\0xx' entries since a couple of people mentioned loosing the '^x'
sequences en route (?#!).

  as, ae : Support for alternate character sets. (Don't know why, just figured
           i'd put them in).

  :ve=\E[\040p:vi=\E[\060\040p  cursor visible/invisible.

  :nl=\E[B:  Old versions of Jove and vi need this.

  :xn:  vt100 kludginess at column 80/NEWLINE ignore after 80 cols(Concept)
     This one appears to fix a problem I always had with a line ending
     at 'width+1' (I think) followed by a blank line in vi. The blank
     line tended to disappear and reappear depending on how the screen
     was refreshed. Note that this is probably needed only if you use
     something like a Dnet Fterm with the window sized to some peculiar
     dimension larger than 80 columns.

  :k0=\E9~: map F10 to k0 - could have F0-9 -> k0-9, but ... F10 was 'k;'
            Apparently vi only knows up to k9 :-(

  F1-FA   : removed F11 through F20. 
  Also removed a couple of 'sent by xx key' commands. Couldn't find anything
  which used them either.

  Also, Ross mentioned that you might want to add the following items to use
  hard tabs with vt100 tabsettings (8 spcs). Actually I don't see any
  difference as tabs are currently expanded to 8 spaces on the Amiga, but ...
  :pt:if=/usr/lib/tabset/vt100:

  It has also been brought to my attention that only the following
  commands are typically used by such as vi, so a more compact Amiga
  termcap could be made for those who so wish.

I noticed that you got rid of the tabset file.  At least that solves
the problem of installing a new one.  I assume that it wasn't missed.

Sorry for the delay, but I've been busy.

What follows is the sorta definitive 3163 printcap.  The reason why it is
definitive is because I found a terminfo entry for the 3163 on an IBM
PS2 running AIX which I converted into termcap style.  The reason why
I put the sorta in front is because it doesn't handle tabs very well.
(On occasion it can get into a wierd mode where tabs cause it to
home the cursor, due to no tabs being set.  Setting the tabs is of dubious
use since it is cleared every time you clear the screen.

However, it works for 99.999% of what you do.

Here it is:

You're right, that one did have some improvements.  However, I noticed
a couple of optimizations (and a missing feature), so here's 
a revision of Kent Polk's termcap.  You should probably forward a
copy to him to confirm, but I'm using the termcap included here
without any problems at the moment.

I added the "IC" capability (I'm not sure why he didn't include this).
I also converted the bl capability to a vb, since normally the Amiga
has no audible bell without random software intercepts and such.
I also found out (just now) that cursor up and down can be represented
more tersely with a two-character string (esc-M and esc-D), so I've 
put those in instead of the more ANSI-ish ones.  I don't know what his
"is" string does, so I've left it in.  I added kn#10, and switched the
le capability to simply use ^H, which is identical in all respects
to the ANSI control.  I also dropped out some extraneous zero's
in se, ue, and me to make the control codes a bit terser.  Finally,
I removed altogether the .nl "capability", which was (obviously)
ignored, and wrong in any case.  One further change could perhaps
be made:  if "sf" is guaranteed to be used only on the bottom line,
with cursor column undefined after it is sent, ^J could be used instead.

Didn't have anything to test it with. My PD tput crashed when I tried
using it & never determined why. I can assume it works and put it in
if he got it working.

Fine, I have never needed it though. Added it without any problems.

I prefer the ANSI sequences and the included 0's for consistency and
readability. Not so concerned about a few less bytes here and there.
The termcap I mail out on Usenet is used on many machines, & I use the
ansi stuff for more compatibility.

> I don't know what his "is" string does, so I've left it in.
Tells the Amiga to treat linefeeds as true linefeeds. I probably should
have kept who suggested what & why, but someone had a problem on his
machine without this, & it didn't cause problems anywhere else, so I
kept it in. It is also a marker for people who want to customize their
window on the Amiga.

>I added kn#10,
Ok. Again, don't know of a good way to test this one with my current
tools.

> I removed altogether the .nl "capability", which was (obviously)

Got me on that one, must have made a typo which no one caught. My notes
have it mapped properly, but since it doesn't seem to be working (even
incorrectly) I guess I'll take it out.

I really don't want to make that assumtion. Maybe all released software
does, but I doubt it.

First, each of the following pairs of entries are identical:  (S2 = S3),

number of lines(:li).  I will need these entries to be consolidated with

Dear Termcap Wizards,

The following is a revision of the termcap entry for the Hewlett-Packard 98550a
high-resolution large-screen color display I sent you on 06 September 1990 at
17:02ET. These fancy devices are often used as the standard consoles on HP 9000
series 300 computers.  This termcap entry is based on the HP terminfo database
for the hp98550a and has been tested using "vi" and "more" by doing an "rlogin"
to a Sun 3.  I hope you can make use of it.  I have also included the tabset
file referred to by the "if" parameter in the termcap settings.

It's needed by a new termcap entry.  Thanks,

These names and "ibm-3270-2" used by tn3270 are standard format names specified
in one of the Telnet RFCs.  Perhaps DCNS could provide the reference so that
at least the most important DEC terminals are covered by name in the termcap.

= Subject: termcap for ibm-3270-2
= I couldn't find any reference to ibm-3270-2 or anything like it in the
= termcap file.  Is there a desired synomym in /etc/termcap for ibm-3270-2?

Ibm-3270-x is the terminal type that tn3270 uses even if it is logging into
a non-3270 system such as UNIX.  For some reason, the plain Telnet part of
tn3270 does not send/negotiate the actual user terminal type.

At first I was planning to suggest that ibm-3270-2 should be equivalent to
nansisysk so that PCs using the older version of the UB tcp/ip software would
get the correct terminal type (they sometimes liked tn3270 better than UBs tn).
However, I presume that all such users have already coped many years ago.

Consequently, rather than introduce an anacronism and because we cannot be
of service to UNIX tn3270 users anyway, that we just leave out ibm-3270-2.

OK, I've added the vc414h and vc414h-noxon for you.  I've left out the
brain-damaged versions (vc4-4ht) because they seem a bit too marginal
in their appeal and not as well developed.  Let me know if you feel

Subject: vt100 termcap change

Hi Keith,

I got a request to change the vt100 termcap entry in a fairly visible way.
It looks like the right thing to me, but I though I'd better get a second
opinion before risking the wrath of millions.

Here's the proposed change.  It appears that forever the vt100 has had its
:if capability incorrectly named :rf (reset codes file).  Below is an
annotated octal dump of the current :rf file.

I don't think, that we`ll need those. I am using the vc414h-noxon

Subject: Wy60 should not have "km"

The Wyse 60 terminal does not have a "meta" key.  The "km" capability
in the Wy60 terminal description should thus be removed.

    This was corrected on the Math Department SUNs sometime last year,
but was apparently undone over the summer.

   (Even if there is some way to convince it to have a "meta" key, since
the Portselectors at Berkeley use 7 bit/Even Parity, it is not reasonable
to keep the Wy60 terminals that the Math Dep't uses set to 8 bits/No Parity
in order to take advantage of the "meta" key.)

Hi keith,


Could you add following termcap entries ?

Thank you,

PS	X11R5 xterm termcap was updated.
	kterm termcap is required it, I think.

Thanks for your suggestions for new Wyse termcap entries.
They and several other versions have been tested extensively
by Wyse users here and a synthesis will appear in the 4.4BSD release.

Below is a terminal type which we use here at HFH. This terminal is a vt100
emulation with a proprietary IBM 3180 style keyboard. It is typically used
in applications where async access capabilities along with mainframe access
through protocol converters or gateways must be accomplished. The name brand
is Rebus, but it is marketed here in the U.S. by Diversified Data Resources
in California. The terminal is available in RS-232 and RS-422 flavors and
we connect them to a variety of networking devices including multiprotocol
terminal servers.

   Hello,

   I'm currently doing most of the maintenance for the BSD version of termcap
   an was wondering who is doing the equivalent for the GNU project.  I'm
   interested in finding out what new capabilities GNU has added, what their
   plans are (eg, what about terminfo?), and whether it would be feasible to
   merge the BSD and GNU termcap files.

   Please forward this to the appropriate people, or let me know whom to
   contact.  Thanks,

	   John Kunze

You should have a look at file:
	man/termcap.texinfo in the GNU Emacs distribution 
to see the enhancements made in the GNU termcap.

We distribute several version of the termcap data base with GNU Emacs
(see etc/termcap.{dat,ucb} in the GNU Emacs distribution).

Joe Arceneaux (Cc: above) is the GNU Emacs developer and is the real
person to talk to about this.  I suggest it be easiest for GNU to just
continue distributing the separate versions, unless CSRG wants to
adopt the GNU termcap library.
