Subject: Ann Arbor Ambassadors vs. 4.2BSD : net.bugs.4bsd net.info-terms

Index: etc 4.2BSD

The tab initialization sequence in the termcap for the Ann Arbor
Ambassador which is distributed with 4.2BSD is incorrect.  The problem
is that this sequence does not set a tab at column 0; a tab in column 72
with line wrap set will move the cursor to column 8 of the next line,
while it should move it to column 0.  When the RESET key on the
Ambassador is hit, tabs are set properly.

Subject: XON/XOFF problems with vt125
Index: etc/termcap 4.2BSD

Description:
	The vt125 terminal has a nonstandard feature of sending
	multiple XOFF's as its buffers rapidly fill.  This confuses
	the kernel which only expects one.
Repeat-By:
	cat /etc/termcap on a vt125 terminal at 9600 baud.
	Your terminal should soon freeze up.
Fix:
	Here's our vt125 termcap entry that seems to have eliminated
	the problem.  Chances are it will still occasionally
	bite you in graphics mode unless appropriate delays are
	inserted by your graphics filter.  You can manually send
	a ^Q (XON) character to free things up if this happens.


#
# adjusted vt125 entry featuring visible bell and two plane clear
# also deleted padding delay because xon/xoff already used and
# null characters moved cursor! (at least in visible bell string)
#
# 9/22    cr and nl delay inserted to avoid second and third XOFF
#	  as buffer fills to 116 and 128 characters.  am turned off

This is Apollo's termcap for Apollo  



VT100/UNIX -- Using the VT100 emulator with a Remote UNIX(R) System
              Running 'termcap'                                       84/05/16


  The  following are some tips for using the VT100 emulator when the remote host
  is a UNIX(R) system that has the termcap facility.

  Most users set the TERM and  TERMCAP  environment  variables  by  running  the
  'tset'  program in their .login or .profile startup files.  When logging in to
  a UNIX system through  the  VT100  emulator,  you  should  specify  that  your
  terminal  is  a  VT132,  which  is  a  VT100  with insert/delete character and
  insert/delete lines capabilities.  The only difference is that a real VT132 is
  always 24 lines by 80 columns, and the emulator will use  as  many  lines  and
  columns  as  will fit in the DM window.  However, you can automatically modify
  your TERMCAP variable at login time so that the li and co capabilities reflect
  the actual size of the emulator screen.  To do so,  place  the  following  two
  lines,  or  something  similar,  in  your  .login  file (this would need to be
  changed slightly for use in a .profile file):

      tset -s -I vt132 >tset1.$$; setsize <tset1.$$ >tset.$$
      source tset.$$; stty nl0; rm tset.$$ tset1.$$

  where setsize is the following C-shell script:

      #
      set size=`sz`
      set lines=$size[1]
      set columns=$size[2]
      sed -e "s/li#[0-9]*:/li#${lines}:/" -e "s/co#[0-9]*:/co#${columns}:/"

  and sz is a C program, shown below:

      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <sgtty.h>

      main()
      {
          FILE *fp;
          int fd, lines, columns;
          struct sgttyb otty, ntty;

          if ((fd = open("/dev/tty", 2)) < 0)
                  perror("open"), exit(1);
          if ((fp = fdopen(fd, "r")) == NULL)
                  perror("fdopen"), exit(2);
          if (gtty(fd, &otty) < 0)
                  perror("gtty"), exit(3);
          ntty = otty;
          ntty.sg_flags = (ntty.sg_flags & CHO) | RAW;
          stty(fd, &ntty);
          write(fd, "\033[50n", 5);
          fscanf(fp, "\033[%d;%dS", &lines, &columns);
          stty(fd, &otty);
          printf("%d %d\n", lines, columns);
      }

  This program sends ESC[50n to the emulator.  This  is  a  non-standard  escape
  sequence,  in  response  to  which  the emulator sends back the current screen
  size, in the form ESC[nn;mmS, where nn is the number of lines, and mm  is  the
  number of columns.

  NOTE: In  order  for  programs such as 'vi' to work properly in windows larger
        than 24 lines, there is one change you must make to  the  termcap  entry
        for   VT100.      The   sf  (scroll  forward)  capability  is  given  as
        sf=30\E7\E[24H\ED\E8.  This works by saving the cursor (ESC  7),  moving
        to  the  bottom line (ESC[24H, which moves the cursor to the 24th line),
        doing an index operation (ESC D), and restoring the cursor (ESC 8).  The
        problem, of course, is that line 24 may not be the bottom  line.    This
        can  be  fixed  by  changing  the 24 to some very large number, say 200,
        since trying to move the cursor outside the bounds of the screen  always
        causes  it  to be placed at the edge of the screen.  Thus this change is
        safe to make, even when a real VT100 terminal is being used.

This is Apollo's termcap for Apollo

this is a bug long since fixed in releases of /etc/termcap that we haven't
bothered to get, but...

   The termcap listing for "d0|vt100|vt100-am|dec vt100:" seems to be wrong.

   I suggest the following entries be changed:

	 from
	   :is=\E<\E[m\E>\E[?7h\E[?3;4;6l\200\200\200\200\200\200\200\200:\

   (i.e., remove "?" from reset sequence)

       - Bruce Havlicsek (bruce)

Nobody's ever reported this before.  What's the bug, i.e. what
noticeable misbehavior results?  You realize of course it is easy to
set your own termcap entry to do whatever you want.

****************************************************************

I have made the change in my own local termcap file.  According
to the VT100 user's manual, resets can be done in one of two ways:

   ESC [ Ps ; Ps ; . . . ; Ps l  --  multiple resets (Ps is a number)
or
   ESC [ ? Ps l  --  individual resets

What "ESC[?3;4;6l" causes -- at least at my terminal -- is that "4;6l"
is displayed and it does not perform the reset functions.  Since
these modes rarely need to be reset -- 80 columns, jump scroll, absolute
origin -- this bug is probably not obvious.

I suspect you have a termcap problem.  The /etc/termcap file changed with
the last migration of software. If you will contact me when I am in the
consulting office (415) 642-4072, I may be able to put a fix in your
.login file.

To: netinfo@mica.Berkeley.Edu

The last couple of weeks I have experienced problems having to do
with my terminal type, which is a tvi950.
When I type an 'ls', there is none of the usual horizontal space
between file names, everything is meshed together.
When I'm editing with 'vi', the commands that take me word to word,
or to the end of a line (these are only two examples, the point
I am trying to make is that the command is no longer working correctly
in terms of locating things) are not matched up with what I see on the screen,
which makes it difficult to know whether I am making the changes
I think I am making.

I have used 'vi' recently on a tvi925, which when set properly with
the 'setenv' command allows me to use 'vi' the way it is supposed to be used.

Here are two command lines from my .login file, one which deals explicitly
with setting terminal types.  This .login file has been this way for years,
and I have never encountered the problems I described above until a couple
of weeks ago:

set noglob; eval `tset -sn -e \?tvi950`;
set path = (/usr/ucb /bin /usr/bin /usr/local .)

If you have any suggestions on how to restore 'vi' to its former splendor,
which I am assuming means how to properly set my terminal type, I would
appreciate the help.  Thanks,		Lester	(rose:lester)

Subject: Error in termcap for concept 100
Status: RO

Hi,
i propose to change the is - string for all concept 100 terminals
in the following way:
Insert two delays (\200\200) following the \E7 and \E8 terminal command,
this is enter char. mode and set full duplex.
Otherwise you will have some terminal hang ups at 9600 baud, in the
average at each 25 invocation.
The program below shows the error!

Here's a termcap someone send me.  While he is a reliable person, he may be
the only one in the world that this termcap will work for.  I asked him
if the modified driver is going to be an official part of 4.3BSD, in which
case we should install the termcap.  Otherwise, just tuck it away for now.

Hi.  When i came down to see you i talked with your officemate
for a little while, unfortunatly i forgot his name.  He said he
maintains termcap, and i have a termcap entry to give him.  Could
you forward this to him for me?  fyi - i added cursor motion to the

	Would you please tell me all you know about this?
	I want to make sure that all known problems get fixed

I have two of these so far: vt102 and trs100. I suspect there are more.
The new definitions are not the same as the old.

I recommend copying /usr/old/etc/termcap to /usr/old/etc/termcap.save
so we do not loose the old definitions.

My understanding of the history of termcap maintanence is that
ASG and CSRG have been maintaining separate files.  That is to
say in the past, we (ASG) has added termcap definitions that
CSRG does not know about.

Subject: termcap bug
Status: RO

Mike (and termcap keepers),
	below is a piece of code out of what we currently have in our termcap
library for tgetent(); I claim it has a bug in it.  If you look at the initi-
alization of the variable 'tf', you see that it is set to zero.  It is then
used as a file descriptor recipient from open().
		[comments continue after code]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	tgetent(bp, name)
		char *bp, *name;
	{
		register char *cp;
		register int c;
		register int i = 0, cnt = 0;
		char ibuf[BUFSIZ];
		char *cp2;
		int tf;	

		tbuf = bp;
		tf = 0;
	#ifndef V6
		cp = getenv("TERMCAP");
		/*
		 * TERMCAP can have one of two things in it. It can be the
		 * name of a file to use instead of /etc/termcap. In this
		 * case it better start with a "/". Or it can be an entry to
		 * use so we don't have to read the file. In this case it
		 * has to already have the newlines crunched out.
		 */
		if (cp && *cp) {
			if (*cp!='/') {
				cp2 = getenv("TERM");
				if (cp2==(char *) 0 || strcmp(name,cp2)==0) {
					strcpy(bp,cp);
					return(tnchktc());
				} else {
					tf = open(E_TERMCAP, 0);
				}
			} else
				tf = open(cp, 0);
		}
		if (tf==0)
			tf = open(E_TERMCAP, 0);
	#else
		tf = open(E_TERMCAP, 0);
	#endif
		if (tf < 0)
			return (-1);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, please note the test "if (tf==0)" here at the bottom... bad plan.  Here
is the scenario that brought it out:  the TERMCAP environment variable has
been redefined to another file (anything valid), TERM is set to something not
in /etc/termcap, and file descriptor zero is in fact available(!!); so, the
open succeeds, returns zero, and that test promptly becomes a bug.

Obviously it is easy to fix, right, just init 'tf' to -1 and make that test
"if (tf < 0)" like the one just below it.

On to other topics... any comments/feelings on the extensions I proposed for
the termcap database?  We're not particularly dead-set on the actual codes I
suggested, we'd just like to see the capabilities defined officially - one
way or the other doesn't matter.

Do you have a termcap entry for a Visual 500 graphics terminal.
If you know where we can get this I would appreciate seeing it.
We wrote an entry, but yours may be better.

	seem to take on version 4.3.  Setting TERM to w50-132 doesn't work correctly

Subject: termcap additions
Status: RO

Hello,
	I am writing concerning terminal codes currently not contained
in the termcap database.  In particular, the key transmit codes
available on the vt200/vt220/vt240 when operating in vt220 mode.
The current termcap only supports the vt100 emulation modes; in this mode
many of the keys are inactive.  Below is detailed the key transmit sequences.

	The vt200 series works in both 7-bit and 8-bit mode.  Since
(to my knowledge) most Berkeley unix systems are configured to 7-bits,
the key sequences below are the 7-bit variety.

	To enter vt200 emulation mode the sequence: \E[62;1"p
is sent; to return to vt100 mode, \E[61"p    is sent.
Once in vt200 mode, the following sequences are valid:

Key		Termcap code	Sequence
Find		??		\E[1~
Insert		kI		\E[2~
Remove		kD		\E[3~
Select		??		\E[4~
Prev Screen	kP		\E[5~
Next Screen	kN		\E[6~
F6		k6		\E[17~
F7		k7		\E[18~
F8		k8		\E[19~
F9		k9		\E[20~
...
F14		??		\E[26~
Help		??		\E[28~
Do		??		\E[29~
F17		??		\E[31~
...
F20		??		\E[34~

Note that F1-F5 are handled internally to the terminal.

I also found that the insert/delete keys on the tvi920c and h19,h29s are
not supported in the termcap.  I am curious as to why, and whether you
expect termcap to support them some time in the future.

Sincerly,
    Kennard   (white@jason)

I may be just lazy, but it would be convenient to have a
ka#4 option which says that four function key values can
be derived sequentially from the value for k1=.  I.e. _ALMOST_
all terms have 4, 8, or more keys, and their values are e.g.
k1=^Ax\r, where x=PQRS or x=@ABCDEFG, etc.
That's how I planned to set up my function table, after doing
only a tgetstr("k1", p).  (Which is also why I was looking for
a kn#4 on every entry that had a k1=.
Thanks for your help.

Status: RO

Why do only half the terminals which have a k1=
have a kn#8 or whatever?
I'm trying to put Function keys into inp,
but without looking up each kN= string.
In general, they key codes are sequential.
2) is there a termcap entry for the FUNCT
key on the tvi's?  I don't see one, yet that is an
interesting extension of the function key notion.
THanks, Bob

I have a few suggestions for termcap
related to function keys, as I'm trying
to use them in a general way in a program
that looks at termcap.
Please pass this on to whomever is the guru.
I might send it to Mark Horton for comments.
1) kn#8 appears for only some of the terms which have a k1=.  Why?
2) It would be handy to have a 'kc' which says that the given keys
can be shifted.  (Or is this always true?) (kc for Caps; ks is taken.)
3) I could use 'kf', meaning that the tvi's have a FUNCT key which
will send any letter (any key?) in the 3 char sequence.
If these functions have been provided in some later version, please
let me know.  My man page reads 10 May 1980.
Similarly, if those kX have been taken, could we invent some others?
Please send along or refer to any documentation on Fkeys in termcap.
Thanks, Bob Tidd

Status: RO

Dear termcap maintainers:
  Presumably you get lots of suggestions like this one, but I will send it
anyway.  Can we do something about the proliferating entries for the DEC
VT-xxx series of terminals?  There is a lot of duplication of strings in
the file, and this is my local attempt at straightening it out.
  I started because I had a gnu emacs version 17.?? termcap file which did
not support insert/delete line/character.  This combines that file's entries
and the ones in the /etc/termcap that comes with our Gould UTX system
(termcap.src 5.2 (Berkeley) 5/28/85).
  Thank you for "listening".

# Entries for DEC VT-xxx series terminals
# I am making an attempt to combine all of the common forms into one
# combined spot which defines all the things VT-xxx (xxx>=100) can do.
# I am also trying to make some sense out of the miscellaneous combinations
# and orderings that appear in the standard termcap entries.
#
# My reasoning is as follows:
#  a.  The user basically already has the terminal set up the way they want
#       it.  The normal/reverse video and auto-repeat switches are already
#       set, and the termcap entry shouldn't mess with them.  (Otherwise,
#       there is an exponential growth in the number of entries!)
#  b.  While smooth scroll may look nice, it is just too expensive in time
#       to wait for and should be off during editing if we want to be able
#       to use ^S and ^Q.
#  c.  This is set up for gnu emacs which uses ti and te and sends out the
#       ks and ke entries.  I gather vi uses the is and rs strings instead,
#       and in that case the individual entries' is and rs need to be removed
#       and the base entry's ti and te renamed to is and rs for vi (or copied
#       for both vi and emacs).  (Maybe if there were explicit documentation
#       on how these things were to be used, all the programs would use them
#       the same way?)

John,

Here are termcap entries for the varieties of RT displays that may show
up on campus. I have tested the ibmapa16 entry and it seems to work fine.
I can't test the others since I haven't got the displays. None of these
termcap entries are already in /usr/new/etc/termcap (on opal), except
the ibm3101. NOTE: This ibm3101 entry is different than the one already
in /usr/new/etc/termcap. I don't know how you usually handle this problem.
I didn't check that two character names (Ic, If, Ie, etc.) are not
already used in /usr/new/etc/termcap.

If this poses any significant problems, let me know.

Subject: "safe" cm= entries for Microterm Mime Act4 and Hazeltine 1500
Status: RO

For the MicroTerm (Mime Act4), the "safe" cm is:
	:cm=^T%+^X%>/0%+P:
compare that to the original: 
	:cm=^T%.%.:

Also, the safe cm for a Hazeltine 1500 is:
	:cm=~^Q%r%>^^ %+`%+`:
compared to the original:
	:cm=~^Q%r%.%.:

It isn't hard to figure out why the original cm entries (from 4.2BSD and
4.3BSD, respectively) aren't very safe to use. The new "safe" entries take
advantage of the fact that the libtermcap routines strip off the high-order
bits so that \200 becomes \000. Without the high-order bits being stripped,
it would be necessary to add a '%<xy' termcap format in cm to make these safe.

Note: the Mime is happy to receive a \127, unlike the Hazeltine, which
doesn't want to see anything above \126 in the cm string.

In addition, I remember that the email address for all things termcap used to
be included in /etc/termcap, but I don't find it in the /etc/termcaps in either
Ultrix 2.0 or 4.3BSD. Is that just an oversight?

Description:
	Sending control chars for cursor moves causes no end of troubles.
Repeat-By:
	use :cm=~^Q%r%.%.:
Fix:
	replace it with :cm=~^Q%r%>^^ %+`%+`: (attribute it to me, cgs@umd5)
	This takes advantage of the fact that the libtermcap routines
	strip off the high-order bits so that \200 becomes \000. Without
	the high-order bit stripping, it would be necessary to add a '%<xy'
	termcap format in cm to make it "safe".
	Note: the Haz1500 does not want receive anything greater than \126
	      for cursor movement.

Description:
	The al= and dl= entries are just a bit too fast for the terminal
	when editing (gnu-emacs) a really full screen at 9600 baud.
Repeat-By:
	use :al=2.2*^A:dl=2.2*^W: and edit a really full screen (80 cols,
	24 rows full) with a short (15 char) line in row 5 or 6 (not critical).
	Delete rows 2 through 4 quickly, then yank them back. Redraw the
	screen to see what it really ought to look like.
Fix:
	use :al=2.3*^A:dl=2.3*^W:
	This isn't guaranteed to work at 19.2 kbaud, but works fine for 9600.

Subject: What is or isn't installed on xcssun.

1. I see that the version of GNU Emacs installed on xcssun
is 17.49.  Would you like me to install 18.47?  It is much better.

2. There does not seem to be a finger or whois on xcssun.
Is it possible to get one?

3. The termcap entry for sun in /etc/termcap
seems to lack several capabilities such as km, IC and DC.
I think this is correct:

Mu|sun|Sun Microsystems Workstation console:\
        :li#34:co#80:cl=^L:cm=\E[%i%d;%dH:nd=\E[C:up=\E[A:\
        :am:bs:mi:ms:pt:km:\
        :ce=\E[K:cd=\E[J:so=\E[7m:se=\E[m:\
        :kd=\E[B:kl=\E[D:ku=\E[A:kr=\E[C:kh=\E[H:\
        :k1=\EOP:k2=\EOQ:k3=\EOR:k4=\EOS:\
        :al=\E[L:dl=\E[M:im=:ei=:ic=\E[@:dc=\E[P:\
        :AL=\E[%dL:DL=\E[%dM:IC=\E[%d@:DC=\E[%dP:

It may be correct to have a cs capability; I'm not sure.  If so, it
should be the same as it is for the vt100:  cs=\E[%i%d;%dr:
You can check by looking in /etc/termcap on wheaties.ai.mit.edu.

This entry is for a supposed VIDEX clone which nonetheless does not support
cursor addressing correctly (bad hardware? maybe), and uses different so and se
codes than the standard "videx" entry.
