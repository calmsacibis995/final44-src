It is probably easiest to make local termcap changes in separate
files, eg /usr/local/etc/termcap, and encourage people to put

E 3

D 3
	setenv TERMPATH ~/.termcap:/usr/local/etc/termcap:/etc/termcap 

in their shell startup files.  This way local system-wide changes can be
isolated in /usr/local/etc/termcap and user changes in ~/.termcap, all
without consuming lots of disk or requiring re-integration of local
changes when system termcap files change.

To install this directory on your system:

D 3
First determine a list of "common terminals" for your system.
This list will probably be small, and can be empty if you like,
but you should probably put your own terminal in it.

Second, edit the editor script "reorder" to use this list instead
of the list built in to it.  The changes will be evident from looking
at the script.  Notice that the script contains the terminals in order
from least common to most common, since the move commands will move them
to the front in that order, the effect will be to put the most common
at the front of termcap since that's moved last.  The s.* terminals
are specials, and although they don't have to go to the front, they are
probably quite common and really should go near the front.

Third, if you are not a super user and cannot create the directory
D 3
/usr/lib/tabset, make a corresponding directory somewhere you can and
add a line to reorder to globally change all /usr/lib/tabset's to your
own path name.  This change is better than just changing the termcap.src
file because it makes it easier to diff it from newer distributed versions.
Try to keep the source as is whenever possible, and put mungings into reorder.

Now you can run "make install" which will create an /etc/termcap. Again,
if you aren't a super user change the cp command to put it where you can.
In this case you will have to redefine E_TERMCAP in "local/uparm.h", which
will probably be in subdirectories with the other UCB software.


Finally, if you make additions or fixes to termcap, please mail a note
explaining what you did with the fixed termcap entry (not the whole file,
please!) to me at one of the addresses below, so it can be incorporated
back into the original source.  I will normally include anything unless
there is a good reason not to, but I reserve the right to redo it differently.
