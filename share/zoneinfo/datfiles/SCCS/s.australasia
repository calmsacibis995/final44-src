# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin (john@basser.cs.su.oz),
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as ``Eastern Standard Time''
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand. 
#	I have researched New South Wales time only; . . .I hope that perhaps a
#	resident of each state could be found to do it for their own state. 
#	(And I can guarantee that Victoria and NSW are different, so the link
#	between them in the current australasia file must be broken.)

# From Robert Elz (May 5, 1989):

# From next year (1990) NSW will revert to ending DST on the 1st
# Sunday in March (rather than the third, which it appears will
# continue to be what everyone else uses).

# The 1989/90 rule may only last a year.  It is a trial that is
# subject to Ministerial approval to be made permanent.
# The termination of "daylight saving" may actually be second

#  the 1989/90 year was a trial of an extended "daylight saving" period.
