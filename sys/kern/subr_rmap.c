/*
 * Resource map handling routines.
 *
 * A resource map is an array of structures each
 * of which describes a segment of the address space of an available
 * resource.  The segments are described by their base address and
 * length, and sorted in address order.  Each resource map has a fixed
 * maximum number of segments allowed.  Resources are allocated
 * by taking part or all of one of the segments of the map.
 *
 * Returning of resources will require another segment if
 * the returned resources are not adjacent in the address
 * space to an existing segment.  If the return of a segment
 * would require a slot which is not available, then one of
 * the resource map segments is discarded after a warning is printed.
 * Returning of resources may also cause the map to collapse
 * by coalescing two existing segments and the returned space
 * into a single segment.  In this case the resource map is
 * made smaller by copying together to fill the resultant gap.
 *
 * N.B.: the current implementation uses a dense array and does
 * not admit the value ``0'' as a legal address, since that is used
 * as a delimiter.
 */

 * and to be called ``name'', which we print if
 * the slots become so fragmented that we lose space.
