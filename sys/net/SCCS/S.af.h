 * Hash routine is called

D 3
 * where addr is a sockaddr * and h is a afhash * value
 * parameter.  Returns two hash keys for searching.  Keys
 * are not expected to be unique, full comparison on the

 *	struct sockaddr *addr; struct afhash *h;

E 3
 *
D 3
 * N.B.: hash keys must lie in distinct ranges, this is
 *	 done by shifting the net key to the upper word
 *	 with the host key occupying the lower word; the
 *	 routing code uses this fact
 *
E 3
 * Netmatch routine is called
 *	af_netmatch(addr1, addr2);
 * where addr1 and addr2 are sockaddr *.  Returns 1 if network
 * values match, 0 otherwise.
D 3

 * Currently used in if.c and route.c, soon in raw code.
