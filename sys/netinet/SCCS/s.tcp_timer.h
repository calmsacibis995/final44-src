/*
 * The TCPT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions.
 * The TCP has the TCPT_REXMT timer set whenever segments
 * have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet
 * received.  If an ACK is received which advances tp->snd_una,
 * then the retransmit timer is cleared (if there are no more
 * outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there
 * are more ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off,
D 13
 * we retransmit all unacknowledged segments, and do an exponential
 * backoff on the retransmit timer.
E 13
I 13
 * we retransmit one unacknowledged segment, and do a backoff
 * on the retransmit timer.
E 13
 *
 * The TCPT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information
D 8
 * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If an output is attempted when there
 * is data ready to transmit, but nothing gets sent because the window
 * is shut, then we start the TCPT_PERSIST timer, and at intervals
 * send a single byte into the peers window to force him to update
E 8
I 8
 * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If all previous transmissions
 * have been acknowledged (so that there are no retransmissions in progress),
D 13
 * and the window is shut, then we start the TCPT_PERSIST timer, and at
 * intervals send a single byte into the peers window to force him to update
E 8
 * our window information.  We do this at most as often as TCPT_PERSMIN
 * time intervals, but no more frequently than the current estimate of
 * round-trip packet time.  The TCPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever
 * we receive a window update from the peer.
E 13
I 13
 * and the window is too small to bother sending anything, then we start
 * the TCPT_PERSIST timer.  When it expires, if the window is nonzero,
 * we go to transmit state.  Otherwise, at intervals send a single byte
 * into the peer's window to force him to update our window information.
 * We do this at most as often as TCPT_PERSMIN time intervals,
 * but no more frequently than the current estimate of round-trip
 * packet time.  The TCPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever we receive
 * a window update from the peer.
E 13
 *
 * The TCPT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an
D 21
 * connection is idle (no segments received) for TCPTV_KEEP amount of time,
 * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  If the connection
 * is established, then we force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
E 21
I 21
 * connection is idle (no segments received) for TCPTV_KEEP_INIT amount of time,
 * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  Once the connection
 * is established, if the connection is idle for TCPTV_KEEP_IDLE time
 * (and keepalives have been enabled on the socket), we begin to probe
 * the connection.  We force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
E 21
 *	<SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>
 * This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit
 * an ack segment in response from the peer.  If, despite the TCPT_KEEP
 * initiated segments we cannot elicit a response from a peer in TCPT_MAXIDLE
D 21
 * amount of time, then we drop the connection.
E 21
I 21
 * amount of time probing, then we drop the connection.
E 21
I 6
D 9
 *
 * The OOBREXMT timer is to force retransmissions of out-of-band indications.
 * Because out-of-band data is considered critical, it does not exponential
 * backoff, but runs at a multiple of smoothed round trip time until acked.
