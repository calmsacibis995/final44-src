 * Per-HYPER-BUS structure.
 *
 * This structure holds the interrupt vector for the HYPER-BUS,
 * and its address in physical and virtual space.  At boot time
 * we determine the devices attached to the HYPER-BUS and their
 * interrupt vectors, filling in vh_vec.  We free the map
 * register resources of the HYPER-BUS into the structures
 * defined here.
 *
 * During normal operation, resources are allocated and returned
 * to the structures here.  We watch the number of passive releases
 * on each HYPER-BUS, and if the number is excessive may reset the HYPER-BUS.
 * 
 * When HYPER-BUS resources are needed and not available,
 * then device drivers may have to wait to get to the bus and are
 * queued here.  It is also possible for processes to block in
 * the HYPER-BUS driver in resource wait (mrwant); these
 * wait states are also recorded here.
