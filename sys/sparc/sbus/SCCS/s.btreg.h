/*
 * Several Sun color frame buffers use some kind of Brooktree video
 * DAC (e.g., the Bt458, -- in any case, Brooktree make the only
 * decent color frame buffer chips).
 *
 * Color map control on these is a bit funky in a SPARCstation.
 * To update the color map one would normally do byte writes, but
 * the hardware takes longword writes.  Since there are three
 * registers for each color map entry (R, then G, then B), we have
 * to set color 1 with a write to address 0 (setting 0's R/G/B and
 * color 1's R) followed by a second write to address 1 (setting
 * color 1's G/B and color 2's R/G).  Software must therefore keep
 * a copy of the current map.
 *
 * The colormap address register increments automatically, so the
 * above write is done as:
 *
 *	bt->bt_addr = 0;
 *	bt->bt_cmap = R0G0B0R1;
 *	bt->bt_cmap = G1B1R2G2;
 *	...
 *
 * Yow!
 *
 * Bonus complication: on the cg6, only the top 8 bits of each 32 bit
 * register matter, even though the cg3 takes all the bits from all
 * bytes written to it.
