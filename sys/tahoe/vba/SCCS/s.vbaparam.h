/*
 * VERSAbus i/o devices use either memory mapped interfaces
 * or mapped i/o register banks, or some of both.  Page tables
 * are allocated at boot time by each device driver, as needed.
 * VMEMmap is used to map a fixed size portion of the VERSAbus
 * i/o space, while VMEMmap1 maps dynamically defined portions
 * for devices which utilize shared i/o memory.  VBmap is used
 * for mapping kernel intermediate buffers for DMA devices which
 * are incapable of utilizing user virtual addresses or which
 * require page aligned i/o buffers.  The size of the VMEMmap1
 * VBmap tables must be large enough for the needs of all devices
 * in the system.

/*
 * The following macros relate to the segmentation of the VERSAbus
 * i/o space.
 *
 * The VERSAbus adapter segments the i/o space (as seen by the cpu)
 * into three regions.  Cpu accesses to the upper 64Kb of the i/o space
 * generate VERSAbus cycles with a 16-bit address and a non-privileged
 * short i/o space address modifier.  Accesses to the next 1Mb - 64Kb
 * generate 24-bit addresses and a non-privileged standard address
 * modifier.  Accesses to the remainder of the 1Gb i/o space generate
 * 32-bit addresses with a non-privileged extended address modifier.
 * Beware that 32-bit addresses generated from this region always have
 * zero in the upper 2 bits; e.g. a reference to physical address fe000000
 * results in a VERSAbus address of 3e000000.
