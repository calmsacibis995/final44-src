.SH NAME
acp \- ACC ACP6100 NETWORK interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device-driver acp"
.br
.B "device acp0 at uba0 csr 0167000 vector flags 0 acpinta acpintb"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I acp
device provides a network interface to ACC's ACP 6100,
a high-speed, 68000 microprocessor-based communications controller
that provides HDLC.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR
The diagnostic messages below refer to concepts that are
explained further in the ACP 6100 User's Manual.
The driver implements the Command Interface (CIF) and
Access Path Allocation Protocol (APAP)
for the exchange of messages between the host and ACP 6100 front end.
The CIF functions such that Command Interface Messages (CIMs) are
exchanged between the host and the front end in command/response pairs.
The APAP requires that control and data paths be established (by
exchanging CIMs between the host and front end) prior to use.
Several of the messages below flag a violation of the CIF or APAP.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  frame level up".
.sp 0
In response to the attempt to bring up the HDLC line
with the acpconfig program, this message indicates success.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  frame level down".
.sp 0
In response to the attempt to bring down the HDLC line
with the acpconfig program, this message indicates success.
.PP
.BR "acp%d".
.sp 0
This message indicates reset of the interface.  After a UNIBUS reset,
the interface's state is reset if it is on the specified UBA.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: failed getting UBA resources for lcn %d".
.sp 0
Insufficient UNIBUS resources existed to initialize the device.
This is likely caused by a shortage of UNIBUS mapping registers.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  attempt to allocate path failed".
.sp 0
The exchange of control messages and data is performed over
control and data paths respectively.
In an initialization stage, the paths are first allocated via 
path allocation commands from the host to the front end.
This message indicates that a path allocation command sent from the 
host to the front end was unsuccessful.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  bad allocate path response from front-end, invalid DPN = ".
.sp 0
The allocate path commands and responses contain the DPN in the Command
ID (CID) field of the Command Interface Message (CIM) header.
This message indicates that the front end sent a response to the host
with a CID that contains an invalid DPN.
The DPN is either 1 or 2, for the control or data path respectively.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  attempt to deallocate path failed".
.sp 0
This message indicates that a path deallocation command sent from the 
host to the front end was unsuccessful.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  attempt to send system parameters message failed".
.sp 0
This message indicates that the host sent a Set HDLC System Parameters
CIM to the front end, and the front 
sent a CIM response indicating that the command parameters were
not set successfully.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  data path was not successfully allocated".
.sp 0
The control path was allocated successfully, but no response was
received for the command to allocate the data path.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: can't handle af%d".
.sp 0
Associated with each protocol family is an address format.  This 
message indicates that an address family other than AF_INET 
(internetwork:  UDP, TCP, etc.) was used.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: UNEXPECTED TRANSFER REQUEST".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the type of event is a Transfer Request.
Transfer Requests are not supported, and are thus unexpected.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: unknown channel, chan = %d".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the logical channel is invalid.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: I/O abort, chan = %d  func = %x".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the I/O completion status indicates an I/O abort.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: program error, chan = %d  func = %x".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the I/O completion status indicates a program error.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: overrun error, chan = %d  func = %x".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the I/O completion status indicates a data overrun.
A matching pair of I/O requests specified a larger write request
count than the read request count without specifying stream mode.
.PP
.BR "acp%d: NXM timeout or UB parity error, chan = %d  func = %x".
.sp 0
An I/O interrupt from the ACP has occured;
the I/O completion status indicates a transfer count of 0.
Either there is a program error (the byte count on the I/O
request equals 0), or there is a driver error (driver granted
a byte count of 0 in response to a transfer request).
.PP
.BR "acp%d: Unexpected System interrupt, status = %d".
.sp 0
.br
.BR "acp%d:  DISABLED!".
.sp 0
A system interrupt from the ACP has occurred; the interrupt is
unexpected, and the interface is disabled.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  PWRUP Diagnostic failure = %d".
.sp 0
A system interrupt from the ACP has occurred; the powerup
diagnostics have detected a failure.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  couldn't get init buffer".
.sp 0
This indicates that an mbuf could not be allocated for sending
the initialization message to the ACP6100.
.PP
.BR "acp%d:  supervisor error, code = %x".
.sp 0
A supervisor message is received; if the message is other
than a LINE_STATUS link message, this error message is sent.
