NAME
     acpconfig - configure ACC's ACP network interface

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/acpconfig _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e [ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s ] [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ]

DESCRIPTION
     The _a_c_p_c_o_n_f_i_g program is used to administer an ACC ACP net-
     work interface front-end processor.  There are numerous
     options allowing interface configuration, maintenance of an
     address translation table, console debugging/logging con-
     trol, and status inquiries.  The options are discussed
     below.

     When bringing up an ACP device, the configuration parameters
     can be set for external or internal transmit clock and baud
     rate, internal or external loopback, and DTE or DCE mode.
     The configuration parameters are described further in the
     user manual that accompanies your ACP interface.  For the
     ACP 5250 and ACP 6250, you may select DDN standard mode, DDN
     basic mode, or PDN (Public Data Network) X.25 service.

     When the system is brought up, _a_c_p_c_o_n_f_i_g is normally called
     from /etc/rc.local to configure the ACP front end and to
     define its internet address; it can also be used later to
     redefine the interface's internet address or configuration.
     _a_c_p_c_o_n_f_i_g is also used as part of an installation verifica-
     tion procedure when the ACP front end and the network inter-
     face driver are installed.  Once a parameter is specified,
     it applies to subsequent commands unless explicitly changed.
     When PDN service is employed, _a_c_p_c_o_n_f_i_g is used to add to,
     delete from, and read the contents of an internet-to-X.25
     address translation table used by the driver.

     The _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e parameter is a string of the form "name unit"
     (e.g., "acp0") which corresponds to the interface as it is
     defined in your system configuration file. Note that _a_c_p_c_o_n_-
     _f_i_g is always invoked with the _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e parameter.  The
     interface parameter name is "ddn" for ACP 625, "dda" for ACP
     5250/6250, and "acp" for ACP 5100/6100.

     The _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is either a host name present in the host name
     database or an internet address expressed in internet stan-
     dard dot notation (e.g., 1.0.0.3).

     For each of the following options, white space (ASCII SPACE
     or TAB characters) is _o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l between the "minus letter"
     flag and the following parameter.  For example, "-b 0" and
     "-b0" are equivalent.

     The -b baud_rate and -u mode options apply to all interface
     types (ddn, dda, and acp).  All other options are specific

     to the dda (ACP 5250/6250) interface.

     -b baud_rate   Select baud rate (which sets internal
                    clocking) or external clocking.  The baud
                    rate is set to control the speed of the
                    internally generated communications circuit
                    clock physically located on the ACP front-end
                    hardware, the transmitter clock.  (A modem's
                    timing signal is an example of an externally
                    generated clock source not physically on the
                    ACP front end.) The -b flag is specified with
                    a nonzero value for baud rate (internal
                    clocking), or a zero value for external
                    clocking.  The tables below list valid baud
                    rates.

                     * These are nominal baud rates.  In some
                    cases, the actual baud rate differs from the
                    nominal baud rate by a few percent.  Consult
                    your user's manual for further information
                    and descriptions of baud rates.  The unit of
                    measure is bps unless otherwise specified: M
                    = megabits/second, and K = kilobits/second.
                    The unit of measure does not need to be
                    supplied with the -b flag, it is optional.
                    To set the acp0 baud rate to 1.33
                    megabits/second, enter a command of the
                    following form:  "acpconfig acp0 -b 1.33M -u
                    1".  External clocking is the default for ACP
                    5100/6100 and ACP 5250/6250.  To bring up the
                    link with external clocking (the -b flag may
                    be omitted), use a command of the following
                    form: "acpconfig dda0 -u1".

                    Note that for the ACP 625 device (ddn
                    interface), the clocking is not settable by

                    software.  Only the baud rate can be set by
                    software.  For the ACP 625, the specification
                    of external or internal clocking is a
                    hardware configuration option.  The ACP 625
                    is factory configured to transmit a clock
                    signal on specified RS-449/422 or RS-232 pins
                    that can be used if an external clock is not
                    provided.  Refer to the ACP 625 User's Manual
                    (ACC P/N 1500015) for more details.

     -s X.25_service
                    Specify DDN X.25 standard, DDN X.25 basic, or
                    PDN X.25 service.  The -s flag is specified
                    with an _X._2_5__s_e_r_v_i_c_e value of 0, 1, or 2.

                         -s 0   DDN standard X.25 service
                         -s 1   DDN basic X.25 service
                         -s 2   PDN X.25 service

                    As stated in the DDN X.25 specification, the
                    DDN X.25 provides two types of service: DDN
                    basic X.25 service and DDN standard X.25
                    service.  DDN standard X.25 service provides
                    only local DTE to local DCE support of the
                    X.25 connection.  A reliable transport
                    protocol (i.e., TCP) provides DDN standard
                    X.25 service.  DDN basic X.25 service
                    provides end-to-end call management with
                    significance as described in CCITT
                    Recommendation X.25.

                    The -s flag is valid only for the ACP 5250
                    and ACP 6250 devices which provide DDN
                    standard mode, DDN basic mode, or PDN X.25
                    service.  The default for both devices is DDN
                    standard mode; The acpconfig "-s" flag may be
                    omitted if this is the desired service.

                    The use of PDN X.25 service requires that an
                    address translation table be communicated to
                    the driver, to enable it to convert between
                    the internet address and the X.25 address of
                    all sources and destinations.  (A conversion
                    algorithm is used for DDN service.) The
                    address table must include entries for the
                    local ACP front end and for all destinations,
                    in order for connections to be established.
                    Creation and management of the address
                    translation table is accomplished by the use
                    of the -A, -a, -d, and -r options.

     -A filename    Add the contents of the named file to the

ACPCONFIG(8C)       UNIX Programmer's Manual        ACPCONFIG(8C)



                    driver's address translation table, used in
                    PDN mode.  The filename may be any absolute
                    or relative pathname.  The named file must
                    contain lines which consist of an internet
                    address followed by white space followed by
                    an X.25 address.
                    The internet address may either be in
                    standard "dot" notation (of the form a.b.c.d;
                    see INET(3N)) or the name of a host from the
                    system host name database.  For example,
                    either "14.2.3.1" or "host-name" is
                    acceptable. The network portion of each
                    internet address must be non-zero.
                    The X.25 address must be a string of from
                    twelve to fourteen ASCII decimal digits, and
                    have a non-zero DNIC field (the first four
                    digits, e.g., 3110 for Telenet).  Thus, an
                    acceptable X.25 address might be
                    "31103010007600".  The requirement for a
                    minimum length of 12 and a non-zero DNIC may
                    be changed by suitable alteration of the
                    #define'd values PDNX25AMIN and PDNBADDNIC in
                    the acpconfig.c source file, followed by
                    recompilation.
                    Blank lines, lines beginning with the
                    character "#", and any characters following
                    white space after the X.25 address field are
                    all ignored.
                    Due to the necessity of reading each entry in
                    the file and passing it to the driver for
                    installation in its translation table,
                    execution of the -A option may take a
                    noticeable amount of time.  A message is
                    displayed indicating that a delay will be
                    observed.
                    Error messages are displayed if an internet
                    address specified in the file is already in
                    the table, or if insufficient space is
                    available in the table to add all entries
                    requested.  In the latter case, all entries
                    from the file which fit are entered.

     -a ipaddr x25addr
                    Add a single entry to the driver's address
                    translation table, used in PDN mode.  The
                    _i_p_a_d_d_r field must be an internet address of
                    the format prescribed above for the "-A"
                    option (e.g., "14.2.3.1" or "host-name").
                    The _x_2_5_a_d_d_r field must be an X.25 address of
                    the format prescribed above for the "-A"
                    option (e.g., "31102130006578").  An error
                    message is displayed if the specified

                    internet address is already in the table, or
                    if insufficient space is available in the
                    table to add the requested entry.  A single
                    acpconfig command may include more than one
                    -a option.

     -d ipaddr      Delete a single entry from the driver's
                    address translation table, used in PDN mode.
                    The _i_p_a_d_d_r field must be an internet address
                    of the format prescribed above for the "-A"
                    option (e.g., "14.2.3.1" or "host-name").  An
                    error message is displayed if the specified
                    internet address is not in the table.  A
                    single acpconfig command may include more
                    than one -d option.

     -r count       Read address translation table entries; the
                    internet address and corresponding X.25
                    address obtained from the first _c_o_u_n_t entries
                    in the driver's address translation table
                    will be displayed.  If _c_o_u_n_t is zero, or
                    greater than the maximum size of the table,
                    all entries are returned, along with an
                    indication of the maximum possible size of
                    the table.  Internet addresses contained in
                    the address table are displayed in normal
                    a.b.c.d format.  The order in which entries
                    are displayed is dependent on the table
                    maintenance algorithm in the driver.
                    Currently, the table is sorted on internet
                    address as stored internally (d.c.b.a).

     -u mode        Bring up the interface (enable link level) in
                    the specified configuration, or bring down
                    the interface (disable link level).  A _m_o_d_e
                    value of 1 - 4 enables link level with the
                    specified loopback configuration and DTE/DCE
                    mode.  For normal operation, the interface is
                    configured for no loopback; external and
                    internal loopback configurations are used
                    only for installation verification.

                         -u 0   bring down the interface
                         -u 1   bring up the interface for normal DTE operation without loopback
                         -u 2   bring up the interface for normal DCE operation without loopback
                         -u 3   bring up the interface in external loopback
                         -u 4   bring up the interface in internal loopback

                    The DTE/DCE mode sets the DTE/DCE address
                    used by the link-level protocol to reference
                    the interface.  When DTE mode is specified
                    (-u 1), the address is 03.  When DCE mode is

                    specified (-u 2), the address is 01.  With
                    the exception of the address, no other
                    changes are made by specifying DTE or DCE.

                    When PDN X.25 service has been specified (by
                    -s 2), a -u option to bring up the interface
                    (-u 1 through -u 4) will not succeed unless
                    an address translation table entry already
                    exists for the ACP front end interface's
                    internet address.  Otherwise an error message
                    will be displayed, and such an address table
                    entry must be added (via a -a or -A option)
                    before the interface can be brought up.

                    Note that when external loopback is specified
                    with "-u 3", you should specify a baud rate
                    so that internal clocking is used.  A front
                    end configured for external loopback will not
                    function properly unless a baud rate is set.
                    To set external loopback, use a command of
                    the following form:  "acpconfig dda0 1.0.0.1
                    -b 500K -u 3".

     -m message     Send an arbitrary supervisory message to the
                    ACP 5250/6250.  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e is a sequence of
                    arguments each of which represents one byte.
                    Arguments beginning with "0" (zero) are
                    interpreted as octal, others are interpreted
                    as hexadecimal; decimal is not supported.
                    The message is terminated by an argument
                    which begins with a dash or by the end of
                    acpconfig's argument list.  Use of this
                    option requires detailed knowledge of ACP
                    5250/6250 supervisory message formats and
                    parameters.  See Appendix C of the ACP 6250
                    User's Manual and also the section on
                    Supervisory Messages in ch 9 of the ACP 6250

                    may be used at any one time to _c_i_r_c_u_i_t_s. This
                    allows sites connected to Public Data
                    Networks to couple driver behavior to the
                    characteristics of their PDN subscription.
                    This command is not implemented in some
                    releases of the ACP 5250/6250 product.  The
                    maximum and default value is the firmware
                    imposed limit of 64 simultaneous logical
                    channels.  The link must be down when the -n

                    status.
                     If the _t_y_p_e is 0, a Statistics Response
                    message is solicited from the ACP 5250/6250.
                    The results are written to the standard
                    output in tabular form.  With the exception
                    of the packet and byte transfer counts,
                    statistics are cleared when read.

                    If the _t_y_p_e is 1, a driver status query is
                    performed.  This shows the drivers concept of
                    the link state and the driver flags.

     -v key value   Set a driver internal variable symbolized by
                    _k_e_y to _v_a_l_u_e. Possible key values are _l_o_g,
                    _d_e_b_u_g, _p_a_c_k_e_t, and _w_i_n_d_o_w.

                         -v log XXX       Set logging control to XXX hexadecimal
                         -v debug XXX     Set debug to XXX hexadecimal
                         -v packet DDD    Set X.25 packet size to DDD decimal
                         -v window DDD    Set X.25 window size to DDD decimal

                    The _l_o_g variable controls console logging of
                    certain conditions by the driver.  Bit 1
                    (value 2) enables the message "all circuits
                    in use" to the console should that situation
                    occur.  Bit 2 (value 4) enables logging of
                    all calls and clears.  Call and clear logging
                    can be voluminous when the link is in heavy
                    use.  The driver defaults this value to 2,
                    which is appropriate for most sites.  Driver
                    error messages are not controlled by this
                    logging variable (and are never disabled).
                    Example: to enable call and clear logging,
                    and retain "all circuits in use" messages
                    use:

                         /etc/acpconfig dda0 -v log 6

                        To disable, use:

                         /etc/acpconfig dda0 -v log 2

                    The _d_e_b_u_g variable controls driver debugging.
                    This option is only effective if debugging
                    was specified when the driver was compiled.
                    Driver error messages are not controlled by
                    this debug variable (and are never disabled).

                    The _p_a_c_k_e_t and _w_i_n_d_o_w variables control the
                    corresponding X.25 flow control parameters
                    for the unit.  These variables can only be
                    set if the ACP 5250 or ACP 6250 contains

                    firmware release 2.0 or above.  The link must
                    first be brought down (use the -u 0 flag to
                    acpconfig), the variables changed, and the
                    link brought back up.

                    If the driver detects that release 2.0 or
                    higher firmware is installed, it will
                    automatically attempt to negotiate 1024 byte
                    packets with a packet window value of 7.
                    Since this negotiation is conducted according
                    to CCITT and DDN specification, it should be
                    transparent in properly functioning networks.
                    These options exist to allow system
                    administrators to control the values for
                    special situations.  Example: to restrict the
                    interface to a 128 byte packet size and a
                    packet window of 2, use:

                         /etc/acpconfig dda0 -u 0
                         /etc/acpconfig dda0 -v packet 128 -v window 2
                         /etc/acpconfig dda0 -u 1


     -z             Reset the interface device.  The interface is
                    the actual front-end hardware plugged into
                    your host UNIBUS or QBUS.  For example, the
                    device may be an ACP 6250.  To reset the dda0
                    device give a command of the following form:
                    "acpconfig dda0 -z".  A message will appear
                    on the system console telling you a device
                    reset is in progress, and to wait for one
                    minute.  There is a pause during the reset
                    because the powerup diagnostics are run for a
                    short period of time.

     Use of "-u 0" disables link level on the front end.  Success
     is indicated by a "link disabled" message on the console
     terminal.  Two disable commands followed by one enable is
     not recommended.  If two disables have been sent (link level
     disable is aborted) then a delay (long enough for the line
     to settle, 60 seconds) is required before issuing a link
     enable command.  In the following sequence, note that the
     line is disabled each time the parameters are changed:

          acpconfig dda0 -u 4
          acpconfig dda0 -u 0
          acpconfig dda0 -b 1.33 -u 1

     the internet address, an error message is generated and no
     further processing occurs.

     All interface ioctls are limited to the super-user.

     Example: To specify internet address 1.0.0.1, external
     clock, normal DTE operation, and DDN standard X.25 service
     use a command of the following form: "acpconfig dda0 1.0.0.1
     -u 1".

DIAGNOSTICS
     Diagnostic messages appear on your terminal to indicate that
     the interface's configuration has been established as
     specified, or an error occurred during acpconfig program
     execution.

     usage: acpconfig interface [address] [options]
     The program was invoked with incorrect arguments.

     acpconfig:  invalid number of arguments.
     The acpconfig program must be invoked with a minimum of 2
     arguments, the first of which is the interface name.

     acpconfig:  reset in progress, wait 1 minute.
     This command appears in response to an acpconfig command to
     reset a specified device.  The delay provides time for the
     powerup diagnostics to complete.

     acpconfig:  command in progress.
     The acpconfig command is in progress, expect a small delay.
     Two passes are made with a delay of about 30 seconds between
     attempts.  This message indicates that the second attempt is
     in progress.

     acpconfig:  device not operational.
     The front end device is not operational.  Repeat the
     command.  In response to the acpconfig command to initialize
     the front-end device, a check is made to verify that powerup
     diagnostics have completed.  If the diagnostics have not
     successfully completed, then there is a 30 second delay
     followed by a second attempt to initialize the front end.
     This message indicates that the device was still not
     operational at the time of the second initialization
     attempt.

     acpconfig:  no internet address assigned to interface.
     The interface must be assigned an internet address before
     any of the configuration parameters will be accepted.  You
     may assign an interface address in the following manner:
     "acpconfig dda0 1.0.0.1".

     acpconfig:  invalid baud rate '%s'.
     The baud rate argument for the -b flag must be one of the
     values listed above.

     acpconfig:  '-b 0' invalid for specified interface.
     The '-b 0' command (for specifying external clocking) does
     not apply to the specified interface (i.e., ddn?).  The '-b
     0' flag is only valid for ACC ACP devices that support
     software selection of internal or external clocking.  The
     ACP 625 device does not.  In the case of the ACP 625 ddn
     interface, the clocking is selected via strapping options,
     not software control.  The use of "-b 0" is valid for the
     ACP 5100/6100 'acp' interfaces or the ACP 5250/6250 'dda'
     interfaces because they support software selection of
     internal or external clocking.  For more detail consult the
     user's manuals.

     acpconfig:  ioctl (SIOCGIFFLAGS) no such interface, check
     CSR address if ACP board installed".
     The specified interface does not exist.  This message
     indicates that one of many possible errors exists:  the ACP
     board itself is not installed in the QBUS or UNIBUS, the ACP
     board is in a UNIBUS slot which does not have NPR unwrapped,
     the driver is not installed, the ACP board is installed with
     a CSR address which does not match the one in the system
     configuration file, or the name of the interface was
     misspelled.

     acpconfig:  ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns permission denied.
     You must have sufficient (root) privilege for this
     operation.

     acpconfig:  socket: <error explanation>.
     This message indicates that a socket could not be created
     for the reason given.

     acpconfig: invalid internet address '%s'.
     This message indicates that the value for the internet
     address is invalid.  The internet address must be given in
     "dot notation" or be a valid host name.

     acpconfig:  invalid mode '%s'.
     The mode argument for the -u flag must be a value 0 - 4.

     acpconfig: '%s' flag invalid for specified interface.
     The flag identified does not apply to the specified
     interface (i.e., acp?).  The -s, -A, -a, -d, and -r flags
     are only valid for ACC ACP devices which support DDN/PDN
     X.25 service.

     acpconfig:  invalid X.25 service.
     The X.25 service argument for the -s flag must be a value 0

     acpconfig: processing file '%s'; please wait....
     Acpconfig is beginning to read address pairs from the named
     file, as requested by the -A flag; some delay will be
     observed while all addresses are passed to the driver for
     installation in its address translation table.

     acpconfig: cannot open file '%s'.
     When attempting to read address translation table entries
     from a file using the -A flag, the specified file cannot be
     opened.

     acpconfig: bad X.25 address length: '%s'.
     An X.25 address supplied with either the -A or -a flag has
     an invalid length, either greater than 14 or less than the
     minimum value PDNX25AMIN, #define'd in the acpconfig.c
     source code with the default value of 12.  If necessary, the
     value of PDNX25AMIN may be changed and acpconfig recompiled.

     acpconfig: invalid X.25 address '%s'.
     An X.25 address supplied with either the -A or -a flag
     includes characters which are not decimal digits, which is
     invalid.

     acpconfig: incomplete X.25 address '%s'.
     An X.25 address supplied with either the -A or -a flag has
     the invalid string PDNBADDNIC as its first four digits (DNIC
     field).  This string is #define'd in the acpconfig.c source
     code with the default value "0000".  If necessary, the value
     of PDNBADDNIC may be changed and acpconfig recompiled.

     acpconfig: end of address table (%d entries max).
     A request for display of address translation table entries
     specified more entries than the table holds; the maximum
     table size is noted; all current entries have already been
     displayed.

     acpconfig: address table entry %d: %d.%d.%d.%d ==> %s.
     This information is displayed for each address translation
     table entry requested via the -r flag.  %d.%d.%d.%d is an
     internet address whose corresponding X.25 address is %s.

     acpconfig: ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns: Operation already
     in progress.
     acpconfig: must shut down interface to change modes between
     DDN and PDN.
     An attempt was made, while the interface was up, to change
     between DDN and PDN service via the -s flag.  This is
     allowed only after bringing the interface down via -u 0.

     acpconfig: -u flag must be last.
     The -u flag must follow all others in any acpconfig command,
     in order that all requested options may be set before the
     interface is brought up (or down).

     acpconfig: ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns: Can't assign
     requested address.
     acpconfig: no local X.25 address translation in table;
     cannot start up PDN mode.
     These two messages indicate that an attempt was made to
     start up the interface for PDN service (via -s 2 then -u),
     but no address translation table entry exists for this
     host's internet address.  Use -A or -a to add such a table
     entry then try again.

     acpconfig: ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns: Address already in
     use.
     An attempt was made to add an entry to the address
     translation table, but an entry was already present in the
     table for the identical internet address; no action was
     taken.  Note that if the table is already full the following
     message will appear instead.

     acpconfig: ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns: Not enough core.
     An attempt was made to add an entry to the address
     translation table, but no space remained in the table.  The
     maximum size of the table may be determined by using the -r
     0 flag; increasing the table size may be accomplished only
     by rebuilding the kernel.  An alternative is to delete
     unused entries via the -d flag

     acpconfig: ioctl (SIOCACPCONFIG) returns: Bad address.
     An attempt was made to delete an internet address from the
     address translation table; that internet address was not
     found in the table; no action was taken.

     acpconfig: -m message too long
     The bytes following the -m option exceeded acpconfig's
     internal buffering.  An alternative is to break the long
     parameter command into two or more commands.

     acpconfig: -v what?.
     An unknown key value was issued with the acpconfig -v
     command.

     acpconfig: -v: bad packet size.
     The packet size argument for the -v flag must be one of the
     values listed above.

     the link is brought down via -u 0.

     Changing packet size, window size, or SVC limit requires

NOTES
     The -u flag is positional, it should be the last flag on the
     command line.

     Recommended use of acpconfig is to add a line of the
     following form to /etc/rc:  "acpconfig dda0 address -u 1".
     This command sets the internet address, normal operation (no
     loopback), DTE mode, external clocking, and DDN standard
     X.25 service.

     The most common user error is forgetting to disable the link
     (-u 0) before re-enabling it with new configuration
     parameters.
