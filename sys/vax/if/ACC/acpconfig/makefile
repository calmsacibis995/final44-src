#  author:    Clare E. Russ, ACC Santa Barbara                       #
#  purpose:   create executable image of 'acpconfig' configuration   #
#             program to run under UNIX (BSD, TWG, ULTRIX)           #
#                                                                    #
#  use:                                                              #
#        By default, this makefile builds an executable image,       #
#        acpconfig, for a BSD or ULTRIX  system.  If the TWG world   #
#        is desired, it must be defined explicitly in the make       #
#        command line.						     #
#                                                                    #
#           make            (make acpconfig for BSD or ULTRIX)	     #
#           make bsd        (make acpconfig for BSD or ULTRIX)	     #
#           make twg        (make acpconfig for TWG under VAX/VMS)   #
#           make ultrix     (same as "make bsd", now)		     #
#           make clean      (rm -f acpconfig)                        #
#           make print      (print -nh acpconfig.c)                  #
#                                                                    #
#  date:      V0.6    26 June 1986 Clare Russ                        #
#             add ULTRIX V1.2 and ULTRIX V2.0 support to account     #
#             for differences in the internet address data structure #
#             in_addr (see /sys/netinet/in.h)                        #
#                                                                    #
#	      V0.7    16 March 1987 Jeff Berkowitz		     #
#	      Correct the V0.6 change; there is no reason to have an #
#	      ifdef for ULTRIX versus BSD.			     #
#	      V0.8    15 Sept 1987 Stephanie Price		     #
#	      Give full pathname for in.h and if.h because 4.2BSD    #
#	      may not have the same symbolic links as 4.3BSD.        #
#                                                                    #
