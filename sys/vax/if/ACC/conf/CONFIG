For an Ultrix 3.0 system, add the appropriate lines to the configuration
file before the "config" line.

# We're running Ultrix 3.0
options		ACC_ULTRIX=30
# Enable the PAD (X.29 interface)
options		DDA_PADOPT
# Enable the RAW (programmers interface)
options		DDA_RAWOPT

After the "config" line,  near the end of the device entries,  add the
following line (assuming you have one 6250/5250 to be installed in the
default location):

device         dda0      at  uba0      csr 0167000   vector ddainta  ddaintb
