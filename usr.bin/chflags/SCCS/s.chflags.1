The
.Nm chflags
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
I 2
.It Fl H
D 10
When encountering a symbolic link on the command line, follow it.  All other
symbolic links encountered in the traversal are not followed.
E 10
I 10
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

Traverse a file hierarchy.
For each file that is of type directory,
.Nm chflags
changes the flags of all files in the file hierarchy below it followed
by the flags of the directory itself.
I 2
.It Fl h
When encountering a symbolic link anywhere in the traversal, follow it.
E 10
I 10
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.

Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact
.\"arch	nothing yet.
I 11
D 12
opaque	set the opaque flag
E 11
dump	set the dump flag
E 12
I 12
opaque	set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
nodump	set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
E 12
D 6
sapp	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schng	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
uapp	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchng	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
E 6
I 6
sappnd	set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
schg	set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
uappnd	set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
uchg	set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

Putting the letters
.Dq no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent compact

nodump	the file should never be dumped
E 12
I 12
nouchg	the immutable bit should be cleared

The

option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.

Only the owner of a file or the super-user is permitted to change
the low 16-bits in the flags of a file.
Only the the super-user is permitted to change
the high 16-bits in the flags of a file.

The
.Nm chflags

.Sh FLAGS
Flags may be absolute or symbolic.
An absolute flag is an octal number constructed by
.Ar or'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 6n -compact -offset indent
.It Li 1
the file should never be dumped
.El
.Pp
The symbolic flags is a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are defined:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dump         cause the file to be dumped when it is next modified
.Ed
.Pp
Putting the word ``no'' before an option causes it to be deleted.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nodump       the file should never be dumped
