.SH DESCRIPTION
D 6
The two files are
compared.
(If
.I file1
is `\-',
the standard input is used.)
Under default options,
.I cmp
makes no comment if the files are the same;
if they differ, it announces the byte and line number
at which the difference occurred.
If one file is an initial subsequence
of the other, that fact is noted.
E 6
I 6
The two files are compared.  (If \fIfile1\fP is `\-', the standard
input is used.)  With no options, \fIcmp\fP makes no comment if the
files are the same; if they differ, it reports the byte and line
number at which the difference occurred, or, that one file is an
initial subsequence of the other.  \fISkip1\fP and \fIskip2\fP are
initial byte offsets into \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP respectively,
and may be either octal or decimal; a leading ``0'' denotes octal.
E 6
.PP
Options:
.TP 6
D 6
.B  \-l
Print the byte number (decimal) and the
differing bytes (octal) for each difference.
E 6
I 6
.B \-s
Print nothing for differing files; set exit codes only.
E 6
.TP 6
D 6
.B  \-s
Print nothing for differing files;
return codes only.
.dt
E 6
I 6
.B \-l
Print the byte number (in decimal) and the differing bytes (in octal)
for all differences between the two files.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
D 6
Exit code 0 is returned for identical
files, 1 for different files, and 2 for an
inaccessible or missing argument.
E 6
I 6
Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for different files,
and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument, or a system error.

The cmp utility compares two files of any type and
writes the results to the standard output.

By default,

differ, it writes to standard output the byte and line
number at which the first difference occurred.

if the files are the same; if they
differ, the byte and line
number at which the first difference occurred is reported.
E 8
Bytes and

E 12
E 10
E 9
.Pp
D 8
The input files can be any file type.
.Pp
Results of the comparison are written to standard output.
When no options are used, the format is:
.Pp
.Ds I
"%s %s differ: char %d, line %d\en", <file1>,
<file2>, <byte number>, <line number>
.De
.Pp
When the 
.Fl l
option is used, the format is:
.Pp
.Ds I
"%d %o %o\en", <byte number>, <differing byte>,
<differing byte>
.De
.Pp
for each byte that differs.  The first byte number is from
file1 while the second is from file2.
.Pp
If file1 and file2 are identical for the entire length of
the shorter file, the following format is used, unless the
.Fl s
option is specified.
.Pp
.Ds I
"cmp: EOF on %s\en", <name of shorter file>
.De
.Pp
No output is written to standard output when the
.Fl s option
is used.

The
.Nm cmp

where one file is identical to the first part of
the other.

In the latter case, if the -s option has
E 8
I 8
In the latter case, if the
.Fl s

that EOF was reached in the shorter file (before
any differences were found).

file (before any differences were found).
