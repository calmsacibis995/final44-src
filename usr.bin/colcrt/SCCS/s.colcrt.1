provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
is destructive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `\-')
are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty
lines.
The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however.
The
