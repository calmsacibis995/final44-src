but only if the file becomes smaller.
If no files are specified,
the compression is applied to the standard input
and is written to standard output
regardless of the size of the results.
Compressed files can be restored
to their original form by specifying the
.B \-d
option, or by running
E 2
I 2
D 12
while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times.
If no files are specified, the standard input is compressed to the
standard output.
Compressed files can be restored to their original form using
