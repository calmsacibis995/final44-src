.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Diff3
compares three versions of a file,
and publishes disagreeing ranges of text
flagged with these codes:
.TP 16
====
all three files differ
.TP 16
====1
.IR file1 " is different"
.TP 16
====2
.IR file2 " is different"
.TP 16
====3
.IR file3 " is different"
.PP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range
of a given file to some other is
indicated in one of these ways:
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " a"
Text is to be appended after line number
.I n1
in file
.I f,
where
.I f
= 1, 2, or 3.
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " , " n2 " c"
Text is to be
changed in the range line
.I n1
to line
.IR n2 .
If 
.I n1
=
.I n2,
the range may be abbreviated to
.IR n1 .
.PP
The original contents of the range follows immediately
after a
.B c
indication.
When the contents of two
files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered
file is suppressed.
.PP
Under the
.B \-e
option,
.I diff3
publishes a script for the editor
.I ed
that will incorporate into
.I file1
all changes between
.I file2
and
.I file3,
.IR i.e .
the changes that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3.
Option
.B \-x
(\fB\-3\fR)
produces a script to incorporate
only changes flagged ==== (====3).
The following command will apply the resulting script to
`file1'.

The

.Ar file1 ,

and

E 5
I 5
.Ar file3 ,
writing the result to the standard output.
The options describe different methods of merging and
purging
the separate versions into a new file.
.Nm Diff3
is used by
.Xr RCS 1
to merge specific versions or create
new versions.
.Pp
Options are:
D 7
.Tp Fl e
E 7
I 7
.Bl -tag -width "--E, --X"
.It Fl e
E 7
Produces output in a form suitable as an input script for the
.Xr ed 1
utility.  The script may then be used to merge differences common
between all three files and differences specific to file1 and file3.
In other words, the
.Fl e
option ignores differences specific to file1 and file2, and those
specific to file2 and file3.  It is useful for backing out changes
specific to file2 only.
D 7
.Tp Fl x
