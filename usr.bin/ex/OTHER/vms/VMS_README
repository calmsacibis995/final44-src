This version of ex/vi has modifications to make it run under vms.
Files that are specific to VMS are stored in the "vms" subdirectory.
When installed on a VMS system, all files should be in the same
directory (i.e. files in the "vms" subdirectory should be moved into
the main directory).  The file "makefile.com" is a DCL script for
compiling the ex/vi system under vms.  You will need a C compiler with
all the #include files installed in SYS$LIBRARY.  If they are placed in
other directory, you will need to define either VAXC$INCLUDE or
C$INCLUDE to be the other directory.  Then you should be able to type

	@makefile all

and produce an ex.exe image.

Since vms does not support links, this version of ex/vi tries to figure
out how it was invoked by looking at the *second* argument (argv[1])
with which it was called.  Thus, the proper way to invoke the image is
by having defined strings such as

	EX == "$DEV:[DIR]EX.EXE EX"
	VI == "$DEV:[DIR]EX.EXE VI"
	VIEW == "$DEV:[DIR]EX.EXE VIEW"
	EDIT == "$DEV:[DIR]EX.EXE EDIT"

You must also define the terminal type as well as termcap location, e.g.

	define term "vt100"
	define termcap usr:[huang]term.cap

Note that the "vt100" is in lower case.  This is very important since
vi and termcap are case sensitive.  The default location of the termcap
file is "etc:termcap." but may be overridden by defining the "termcap"
logical name.

Good luck.
