/*
 * The editor uses a temporary file for files being edited, in a structure
 * similar to that of ed.  The first block of the file is used for a header
 * block which guides recovery after editor/system crashes.
 * Lines are represented in core by a pointer into the temporary file which
D 2
 * is packed into 16 bits.  15 of these bits index the temporary file,
 * the 16'th is used by global commands.  The parameters below control
 * how much the 15 bits are shifted left before they index the temp file.

 * is packed into 16 bits (32 on VMUNIX).  All but the low bit index the temp
 * file; the last is used by global commands.  The parameters below control
 * how much the other bits are shifted left before they index the temp file.
E 2
 * Larger shifts give more slop in the temp file but allow larger files
 * to be edited.
 *
 * The editor does not garbage collect the temporary file.  When a new
 * file is edited, the temporary file is rather discarded and a new one
 * created for the new file.  Garbage collection would be rather complicated
 * in ex because of the general undo, and in any case would require more
 * work when throwing lines away because marks would have be carefully
 * checked before reallocating temporary file space.  Said another way,
 * each time you create a new line in the temporary file you get a unique
 * number back, and this is a property used by marks.
 *
 * The following temp file parameters allow 256k bytes in the temporary
 * file.  By changing to the numbers in comments you can get 512k.
D 2
 * By typedefing line to long (32 bit) integers you could get much more
 * space in the temp file with (then) no waste.  This would double core
 * requirements and would probably require some editor debugging.
E 2
I 2
 * For VMUNIX you get more than you could ever want.
 * VMUNIX uses long (32 bit) integers giving much more
 * space in the temp file and no waste.  This doubles core
 * requirements but allows files of essentially unlimited size to be edited.

 *
 * New lines are written into the last block in the temporary file
 * which is in core as obuf.  When a line is needed which isn't in obuf,
 * then it is brought into an input buffer.  As there are two, the choice
 * is to take the buffer into which the last read (of the two) didn't go.
 * Thus this is a 2 buffer LRU replacement strategy.  Measurement
 * shows that this saves roughly 25% of the buffer reads over a one
 * input buffer strategy.  Since the editor (on our VAX over 1 week)
 * spends (spent) roughly 30% of its time in the system read routine,
 * this can be a big help.
