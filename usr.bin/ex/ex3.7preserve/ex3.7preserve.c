/*
 * Expreserve - preserve a file in _PATH_PRESERVE.
 * Bill Joy UCB November 13, 1977
 *
 * This routine is very naive - it doesn't remove anything from
 * _PATH_PRESERVE... this may mean that we leave stuff there...
 * the danger in doing anything with _PATH_PRESERVE is that the
 * clock may be screwed up and we may get confused.
 *
 * We are called in two ways - first from the editor with no arguments
 * and the standard input open on the temp file.  Second with an
 * argument to preserve the entire contents of _PATH_VARTMP (root only).
 *
 * BUG: should do something about preserving Rx... (register contents)
 *      temporaries.
