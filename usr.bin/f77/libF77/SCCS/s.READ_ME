		Unix f77 Math Function Library
			February, 1981

This is the library providing interface to the C math library, libm.a
In addition there are functions for complex and double
complex arguments and short int arguments. There are also utility functions
to enable floating overflow/integer underflow trapping, and to return
numerical range for this machine. Finally there are also the string
functions required by ANSI plus a few additions.

Install these sources in parallel with the other f77 libraries. Then:
	make libF77.a
	make install
	cd man
	make install
