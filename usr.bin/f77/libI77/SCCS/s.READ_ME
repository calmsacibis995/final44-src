		     Unix f77 I/O Library
			November, 1981

	The sources here represent a major update of the original f77 i/o
library.  In almost all cases routines conform to the ANSI standard. The
only known exceptions are the "print" file form in `open' and `inquire',
and the "+" vertical format control (still not implemented). Often relaxations
or extensions of the standard have been incorporated.
See the writeup file for details of the new library.

	The non-ANSI extensions can be eliminated from the library by
changing the Makefile to compile with -DKOSHER.

Install this source in parallel with the other libraries. Then:
	make libI77.a
	make install


Please send bug reports, fixes, etc. to one of
	dlw@g.cc.berkeley	(new uucp mailer)
	ucbvax!g.dlw		(old uucp mailer)
	g.dlw@berkeley		(arpanet)
