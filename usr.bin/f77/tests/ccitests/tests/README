The following files compose the 1978 Fortran Compiler Validation System
(FCVS78) V2.0:

	*.f      : are the Fortran source files
        *.res    : are the expected results corresponding to each .f
                   file
        makefile : is a make file used to run the validation system

To run the validation system using the C shell (csh) type:

	nohup make -i >& make_results &

The test will run in background.  Upon completion two files will have
been created:

	make_results: contains the compile results
	diff_results: contains the differences between the output the
		      programs should have produced and what they did
		      produce

Make_results and diff_results can be examined to determine which of the
validation files did not compile or run correctly.

To clean up the executables, core file, .o's, .run's, and the fort.*
files type:

	make clean

Make clean will leave the files make_results and diff_results.

FM257 requires special actions by the user.  The simple way to test
FM257 is remove it from the makefile file list and compile and run
it separately.  The more adventurous can allow the makefile to test
FM257 but the following actions will be needed.  FM257 tests PAUSE
statements which stop execution and wait for user input.  Using the
C shell (csh) the user can attach to the background job, supply the
input, and then return the job to background. These are the steps to
take:
	1) When FM257 is reached the process will stop and wait
	   for user input.  Once the process has stopped examine
	   the end of the file make_results (`tail make_results`);
	   the last line will will state some command needed to
	   get the process running again.  Note this command and
	   move on to step 2.
	2) Bring the process into foreground using the csh `fg`
	   command.
	3) Type in the command stated at the end of the make_results
	   file.
	4) Type ^Z (CNTRL-Z) to stop the process.
	5) Return the process to background using the csh `bg` command.
	6) FM257 tests five PAUSE statements each requiring repeating
	   steps 1-5.  Keep repeating the above steps until the end of
	   make_results displays compiling information for FM258.
