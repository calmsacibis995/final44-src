This format is multi-line, and includes all the information described above
as well as the user's home
directory and login shell, any plan which the person has placed in the file
.I \&.plan
in their home
directory, and the project on which they are working from the file
.I \&.project
also in the home directory.

Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and minutes
if a ``:'' is present, or days if a ``d'' is present.
