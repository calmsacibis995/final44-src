By default, the core is written to the file
.Dq Pa core.<pid> .
Both the executable image,
.Ar exec ,
and the process identifier,
.Ar pid ,
must be given on the command line.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Write the core file to the specified file instead of
.Dq Pa core.<pid> .
.It Fl s
Stop the process while gathering the core image, and resume it
when done.  This guarantees that the resulting core dump will
be in a consistent state.  The process is resumed even if it was
already stopped.
The same effect can be achieved manually with 
.Xr kill 1 .
