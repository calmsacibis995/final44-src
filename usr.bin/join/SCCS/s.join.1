D 11
The join utility performs an ``equality join'' on the files
E 11
I 11
The join utility performs an ``equality join'' on the specified files
and writes the result to the standard output.
The ``join field'' is the field in each file by which the files are compared.
The first field in each line is used by default.
There is one line in the output for each pair of lines in
E 11
.Ar file1
E 4
and
D 4
.IR file2 .
If
.I file1
is `\-', the standard input is used.
.PP
.I File1
and 
.I file2
must be sorted in increasing ASCII collating
sequence on the fields
on which they are to be joined,
normally the first in each line.
.PP
There is one line in the output 
for each pair of lines in 
.I file1 
and 
.I file2
that have identical join fields.
The output line normally consists of the common field,
then the rest of the line from 
.IR file1 ,
then the rest of the line from
.IR file2 .
.PP
Fields are normally separated by blank, tab or newline.
In this case, multiple separators count as one, and
leading separators are discarded.
.PP
These options are recognized:
.TP
.BI \-a n
In addition to the normal output,
produce a line for each unpairable line in file
.IR n ,
where
.I n
is 1 or 2.
.TP
.BI \-e \ s
Replace empty output fields by string
.IR s .
.TP
.BI \-j n\ m
Join on the
.IR m th
field of file
.IR n .
If
.I n
is missing, use the
.IR m th
field in each file.
.TP
.BI \-o \ list
E 4
I 4
D 11
.Ar file2 .
The joined files are written to the standard
output.
.Pp
The ``join field'' is a field in each file on which the
files are compared.
There is one line in the output for
each pair of lines in
.Ar file1
and
E 11
.Ar file2
D 11
which have identical
join fields.
The output line by default consists of the
join field, then the remaining fields from
.Ar file1 ,
then the
remaining fields from
E 11
I 11
which have identical join fields.
Each output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from
.Ar file1
and then the remaining fields from
E 11
.Ar file2 .
D 11
This format can be changed by
using the
.Fl o
option (see below).

E 10
I 10
.Ql sort -b
E 10
on the fields on which they are to be
joined, by default the first in each line; Otherwise, all
join field matches need not be reported.
E 11
I 11
The default field separators are tab and space characters.
In this case, multiple tabs and spaces count as a single field separator,
and leading tabs and spaces are ignored.
The default output field separator is a single space character.
E 11
.Pp
D 11
The default input field separators are <blank>s.
In this
case, multiple separators count as one field separator, and
leading separators are ignored.
The default output field
separator is a <space>.
.Pp
E 11
I 11
Many of the options use file and field numbers.
Both file numbers and field numbers are 1 based, i.e. the first file on
the command line is file number 1 and the first field is field number 1.
E 11
The following options are available:
D 10

file_number is 1 or 2.

For compatibility with historic versions of

the following options are available:

In addition to the default output, produce a line for each unpairable line
in both file 1 and file 2.
I 14
(To distinguish between this and

.Nm join
currently requires that the latter not include any white space.)

Join on the

field of file 1.
.It Fl j2 Ar field
Join on the
.Ar field Ns 'th
field of file 2.
.It Fl j Ar field
Join on the
.Ar field Ns 'th
field of both file 1 and file 2.
.It Fl o Ar list ...
Historical implementations of
.Nm join
permitted multiple arguments to the
.Fl o
option.
These arguments were of the form ``file_number.field_number'' as described
for the current
.Fl o
option.
This has obvious difficulties in the presence of files named ``1.2''.

These options are available only so historic shellscripts don't require
modification and should not be used.
