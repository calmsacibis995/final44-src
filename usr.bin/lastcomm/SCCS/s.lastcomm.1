If called with arguments, only those accounting entries whose command
name or user name matches one of the arguments are printed.
E 2
I 2
If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a
D 7
matching command
name, user name, or terminal name are printed.
E 2
So, for example,
I 2
.ti +0.5i
lastcomm a.out root ttyd0
E 2

I 7
matching
D 8

E 8
or
D 8
.Ar terminal name
E 8
I 8

are printed.
So, for example:
I 8
.Pp
E 8
.Dl lastcomm a.out root ttyd0
.Pp
E 7
D 2
	lastcomm a.out
.br
E 2
would produce a listing of all the
D 2
executions of commands named a.out, and
.br
	lastcomm root

would produce a listing of all the commands executed by user root.
