Important changes since 4.2:
	Now uses 4.2 filesystem correctly and removes files between lessons.
	Tee'd output to the .ocopy file works.  No more infinite loop on EOF.
	Now maintains a .learnrc file to start you where you left off last
	session.  The undocumented and dubious "xyzzy" command has become
	the documented and dubious "hint" command.  Miscellaneous typos.

Note that play directories are created in /tmp, no longer
in /usr/lib/learn/play.  The C script is not complete;
use at your own risk.  The editor script still smacks of ed.

Make a learn by

When this seems right, extract the lessons by
	make lessons
This extracts the lesson archives
for each course.  You can also do this one step at a
time with "make files", "make editor", etc.,
if you don't want all courses.
If you do things separately, you must also say
	make play; make log

Finally, check that it's sensible with

The best way to get ex to prompt within learn was to modify
the user's environment variables PATH and EXINIT.

Due to inane assumptions in the VAX versions of csh -i and ex
when stdin and stdout are not terminals, kludges have been
added with #if's.  In particular, I use the old terminal driver

A new routine called getlesson tries to construct a valid

The commands "where", "skip", and "again" are also new.
Greeting, closing, and reminder messages have been expanded.
