learn,
for we have benefited greatly from their
suggestions and criticisms.
In particular,
M. E. Bittrich,
J. L. Blue,
S. I. Feldman,
P. A. Fox,
and
M. J. McAlpin
have provided substantial feedback.
Conversations with E. Z. Rothkopf also provided many of the ideas in the system.
We are also indebted to Don Jackowski
for serving as a guinea pig for the second version,
and to Tom Plum for his efforts to improve the C script.
