.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Locate
E 2
searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified
D 2
.IR pattern .
E 2
I 2
.Ar pattern  .
E 2
The database is recomputed periodically, and contains the pathnames
of all files which are publicly accessible.
D 2
.PP
Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\e'', ``['', and
``]'') may be used in
.IR pattern ,
E 2
I 2
.Pp
Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\e'', ``[''
and ``]'')
may be used in
.Ar pattern  ,
E 2
although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
Preceding any character with a backslash (``\e'') eliminates any special
meaning which it may have.
The matching differs in that no characters must be matched explicitly,
including slashes (``/'').
D 2
.PP
E 2
I 2
.Pp
E 2
As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.
