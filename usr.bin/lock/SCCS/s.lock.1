he has no other recourse but to login elsewhere and kill
the lock process.

requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification and
then it will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated. There are three other conditions under it will terminate:
it accepts the password for root as an alternative to the one given
by the user, it will timeout after some interval of time,
and it may be killed by somebody with the appropiate permission.
The default time limit is 15 minutes but it may be changed with the
.B \-number
option where

is the time limit in minutes.
