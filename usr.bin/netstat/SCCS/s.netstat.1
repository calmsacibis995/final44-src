The routing table display indicates the available routes and
their status.  Each route consists of a destination host or network
and a gateway to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows
D 6
the state of the route (``U'' if ``up''), and whether the route
is to a gateway (``G'').  Direct routes are created for each
interface attached to the local host.  The refcnt field gives the

the state of the route (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route

Direct routes are created for each

interface attached to the local host;
the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.
The refcnt field gives the

current number of active uses of the route.  Connection oriented
protocols normally hold on to a single route for the duration of
D 6
a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route then
discard it.  The use field provides a count of the number of packets
