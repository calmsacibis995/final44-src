This directory contains source for a version of yacc needed by the Pascal
parser.  The differences between this yacc and a stadard version 6 yacc
are indicated in a comment in y1.c.

Note that the standard yacc parser will not work on the tables produced
by "eyacc" and also that these changes are really useful only with
a fairly large set of error recovery routines which are part of both
"pi" and "pxp".  The routines are language independent, but the method
will only work on languages which have some redundancy in them... it is
probably ill suited for C, but would work fine in ALGOL-60, ALGOL-W,
EUCLID, LIS, SP/K, PL/1, ALPHARD, CLU, ...

Sun Apr  8 21:43:08 PST 1979

A paper describing the method used by eyacc will appear in August in the
SIGPLAN Boulder conference.

Mon May 5, 1980

The eyacc in this directory has been modified to work for
version 7.  This involved syntax fixes and changing the I/O calls
to standard version 7 calls.
