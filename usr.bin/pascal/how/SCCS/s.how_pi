To translate a program using pi, place the source in a file whose name ends
in the characters ".p", i.e. "prog.p".  The command
	pi prog.p
will translate the program into interpreter code which will be left in the
file "obj" in the current directory.  This code can be executed by typing
	obj
or
	px
The program "pix" can be used for load and go Pascal.
The complete command line syntax for pi is
	pi [ -blnpstuw ] [ -i file ... ] name.p
The command "man pi" will give information as to the options of pi.
Refer to the UNIX Pascal User's Manual for more details.
