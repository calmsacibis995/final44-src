 * SYMBOL TABLE STRUCTURE DEFINITIONS
 *
 * The symbol table is henceforth referred to as the "namelist".
 * It consists of a number of structures of the form "nl" below.
 * These are contained in a number of segments of the symbol
 * table which are dynamically allocated as needed.
 * The major namelist manipulation routines are contained in the
 * file "nl.c".
 *
 * The major components of a namelist entry are the "symbol", giving
 * a pointer into the string table for the string associated with this
 * entry and the "class" which tells which of the (currently 19)
 * possible types of structure this is.
 *
 * Many of the classes use the "type" field for a pointer to the type
 * which the entry has.
 *
 * Other pieces of information in more than one class include the block
 * in which the symbol is defined, flags indicating whether the symbol
 * has been used and whether it has been assigned to, etc.
 *
 * A more complete discussion of the features of the namelist is impossible
 * here as it would be too voluminous.  Refer to the "PI 1.0 Implementation
 * Notes" for more details.

 * STRUCTURED STATEMENT GOTO CHECKING

 *
 * Each label's namelist entry contains two pieces of information
 * related to this check. The first `NL_GOLEV' either contains
 * the level at which the label was declared, `NOTYET' if the label
 * has not yet been declared, or `DEAD' if the label is dead, i.e.
 * if we have exited the level in which the label was defined.
 *
 * When we discover a "goto" statement, if the label has not
 * been defined yet, then we record the current level and the current line
 * for a later error check.  If the label has been already become "DEAD"
 * then a reference to it is an error.  Now the compiler maintains,
 * for each block, a linked list of the labels headed by "gotos[bn]".
 * When we exit a structured level, we perform the routine
 * ungoto in stat.c. It notices labels whose definition levels have been
 * exited and makes them be dead. For labels which have not yet been
 * defined, ungoto will maintain NL_GOLEV as the minimum structured level
 * since the first usage of the label. It is not hard to see that the label
 * must eventually be declared at this level or an outer level to this
