/*
 * Symbol costs for Pascal.
 *
 * Cost strategy of August 14, 1977.
 *
 * The costs determined by the routines in this file are used by
 * the recovery in choosing appropriate corrections.
 * The cost vectors and the error productions in the grammar
 * work together to define the corrective capacity of the grammar.
 *
 * The costs here largely derive from those given in Steve Rhode's
 * thesis for the Pascal-I error correcting parser which he implemented.
 * Some minor changes have been made to adjust for the fact that
 * the current error recovery is not as "smart", both because of the
 * limited forward move and because of the lack of any type information
 * about identifiers.
 *
 * These adjustments largely take the form of increased costs for certain
 * tokens, noticeably keywords which are major brackets such as "begin"
 * "label", "procedure", etc.
 *
 * The overall weighting strategy is still similar to Rhodes' strategy.
 * The costs can be considered:
 *
 *	LOW	<= 3
 *	MEDIUM	4 or 5
 *	HIGH	>= 6
 */
 
/*
 * Insertion costs
 *
 * In addition to the normal symbol insertion costs,
 * there are zero cost insertions here.
 * The current error recovery system treats symbols
 * which have zero insertion cost in a special way,
 * inserting them but suppressing diagnostics.
 * This allows the system to hold of on bracketing
 * error diagnostics about missing end's until the
 * reduction occurs which knows the line number of the
 * corresponding "begin", "repeat", etc.
 * A more intelligent and useful diagnostic can then
 * be printed.
 *
 * Although this routine never allows the insertion
 * of the keyword begin, it can be inserted after a
 * procedure or function body starts, if it was omitted
 * by a special case in the panic routine, which notices
 * the keywords in the statement body of the procedure
 * and inserts the begin to recover.
 *
 * Similarly, we do not insert end-of-file, but
 * the fact that end-of-file is the unique input
 * is noticed by the recovery routines as a special
 * case and handled there.
