Otherwise, the argument is taken to be the name of a file to be updated
or the label of a command to execute. If label and file names conflict,
it is assumed to be a label.
These may be used together to update specific files
using specific commands.

Whole mode. The whole file name is appended to the destination directory
name. Normally, only the last component of a name is used when renaming files.
This will preserve the directory structure of the files being
copied instead of flattening the directory structure. For example,
renaming a list of files such as ( dir1/f1 dir2/f2 ) to dir3 would create
files dir3/dir1/f1 and dir3/dir2/f2 instead of dir3/f1 and dir3/f2.

To help prevent disasters, a non-empty directory on a target host will
never be replaced with a regular file or a symbolic link.
However, under the `\-R' option a non-empty directory will be removed
if the corresponding filename is completely absent on the master host.

from some problem with starting your shell, e.g., you are in too many groups.

There should be a `force' option to allow replacement of non-empty directories
by regular files or symlinks.  A means of updating file modes and owners
of otherwise identical files is also needed.
