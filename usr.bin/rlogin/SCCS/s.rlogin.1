E 17

connects your terminal on the current local host system
.I lhost
to the remote host system
.I rhost.
E 13
I 13
starts a terminal session on a remote host
D 17
.IR host .
E 13
.PP
D 12
Each host has a file
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
which contains a list of \fIrhost\fR's with which it shares account names.
(The host names must be the standard names as described in
.IR rsh (1C).)
When you
.I rlogin
as the same user on an equivalent host, you don't need
to give a password.
Each user may also have a private equivalence list in a file \&.rhosts
D 8
in his login directory.  Each line in this file should contain a \fIrhost\fP
E 8
I 8
in his login directory.  Each line in this file should contain an \fIrhost\fP
E 8
and a \fIusername\fP separated by a space, giving additional cases
where logins without passwords are to be permitted.
If the originating user is not equivalent to the remote user, then
E 12
I 12
D 13
The version built to use the Kerberos authentication from
MIT Project Athena first attempts
to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism, described below.
If this fails, the standard Berkeley \fIrhosts\fP mechanism is used
for authorization to use a remote account.
E 13
I 13
.I Rlogin
E 17
I 17

first attempts to use the Kerberos authorization mechanism, described below.
If the remote host does not supporting Kerberos the standard Berkeley
D 17
.I rhosts
E 17
I 17
.Pa rhosts
E 17
authorization mechanism is used.
The options are as follows:
D 17
.TP
\-8
The \-8 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise

E 22
The
.Fl 8
option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise
E 17
parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
D 22
characters are other than ^S/^Q.
D 18
Eight-bit mode is the default.
E 18
I 18
.Tp Fl E
E 22
I 22
characters are other than
^S/^Q .
.It Fl E
E 22
The
.Fl E
option stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
When used with the
.Fl 8
option, this provides a completely transparent connection.
E 18
I 14
D 17
.TP
\-K
The \-K option turns off all Kerberos authentication.
E 14
.TP
\-L
The \-L option allows the rlogin session to be run in ``litout'' (see
.IR tty (4))
E 17

D 22
.Tp Fl K
E 22

By default, the tilde (``~'') character is the escape character.
E 18
D 17
The \-e option allows specification of a different escape character.
.TP
\-k
The \-k option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host
E 17
I 17
The
.Fl e
D 18
option allows specification of a different escape character.
E 18
I 18
option allows user specification of the escape character, which is
``~'' by default.
This specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal
value in the form \ennn.
E 18
D 22
.Tp Fl k
E 22
I 22
.It Fl k
E 22
The

option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host
E 17
in realm
D 17
.I realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by 
.IR krb_realmofhost (3).
.TP
\-x
The \-x option turns on DES encryption for all data passed via the
E 17
I 17
.Ar realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
.Xr krb_realmofhost  3  .
D 19

.Tp Fl x
E 22

``~'' is the escape character.
Similarly, the line ``~^Z'' (where ^Z, control-Z, is the suspend character)
will suspend the rlogin session.
Substitution of the delayed-suspend character (normally ^Y)
for the suspend character suspends the send portion of the rlogin,
but allows output from the remote system.

A different escape character may

be specified by the

I 12
.PP
All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for
delays) the rlogin is transparent.  Flow control via ^S and ^Q and
flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled properly.
.PP
The
.B \-8
option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
otherwise parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's
stop and start characters are other than ^S/^Q. Eight-bit mode is the default.
.PP
The
.B \-L
option allows the rlogin session to be run in litout mode.

There is no space separating this option flag and the argument

The
.B \-7
option forces seven-bit transmissions.
.PP
The
.B \-d
option turns on socket debugging (see \fIsetsockopt(2)\fR) on the TCP
sockets used for communication with the remote host.
.PP
The
.B \-k
option requests rlogin to obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
.I realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by 
.IR krb_realmofhost (3).
.PP
The
.B \-x
option turns on DES encryption for all data passed via the
rlogin session.
This may reduces response time and increases CPU utilization while
providing increased security.
