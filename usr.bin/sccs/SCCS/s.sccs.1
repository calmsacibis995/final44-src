D 32

D 4
It also runs as a special user
.B sccs
so that the
.SM SCCS
file protection
can be used to advantage.
E 4
I 4
It also includes the capability to run
``set user id'' to another user
to provide additional protection.

that
helps them mesh more cleanly
with
the rest of UNIX.
It
also includes the capability to run
.Dq set user id
to another user
to
provide additional protection.
.Pp
E 32
Basically,
D 32
.I sccs
runs the
.I command
with the specified
.I flags
E 32
I 32
.Nm sccs
runs the command with the specified
.Ar flags
E 32
and
D 32
.I args.
Each
argument
D 13
is modified to be prepended
D 2
with ``sccs/s.''
E 2
I 2
with ``SCCS/s.''
E 2
D 11
unless it begins with ``s.'',
contains a `\|/\|' character,
or specifies a directory.
E 11
I 11
unless
it specifies a directory
or the final component
of the pathname
begins with ``s.''.
E 13
I 13
is normally modified to be prepended
with ``SCCS/s.''.
E 13
E 11
.PP
E 32

Each argument is normally modified to be prepended with

E 32
Flags to be interpreted by the
D 32
.I sccs
E 32
I 32
.Nm sccs
E 32
program must be before the
D 32
.I command
E 32
I 32
.Ar command
E 32
argument.
Flags to be passed to the actual
D 32
.SM SCCS
program
must come after the
.I command
E 32
I 32
.Li SCCS
program must come after the
.Ar command
E 32
argument.
D 32
These flags are specific to the command
and are discussed in the documentation for that command.

I 7
Besides the usual
D 32
.SM SCCS
E 32
I 32
.Li SCCS
E 32
commands,
D 32
several ``pseudo-commands'' can be issued.
E 32
I 32
several
.Dq pseudo-commands
can be issued.
E 32
These are:
D 8
.IP del 1i
E 8
I 8
D 32
.IP edit 1i
Equivalent to ``get \-e''.
.IP delget
E 8
Perform a delta on the named files
and then get new versions.
The new versions will have id keywords expanded,
and will not be editable.
I 16
The \-m, \-p, \-r, \-s, and \-y flags
will be passed to delta,
and the \-b, \-c, \-e, \-i, \-k, \-l, \-s, and \-x flags
will be passed to get.
E 16
I 8
D 10
.IP deled
E 10
I 10
.IP deledit
E 10
Equivalent to ``delget'' except that the
``get'' phase includes the ``\-e'' flag.
This option is useful for making a ``checkpoint''
D 13
of your current editting phase.
E 13
I 13
of your current editing phase.
I 16
The same flags will be passed to delta
as described above,
and all the flags listed for ``get''
above except \-e and \-k
are passed to ``edit''.
I 25
.IP create
Creates an
.SM SCCS
file,
taking the initial contents from the file of the same name.
Any flags to ``admin'' are accepted.
If the creation is successful,
E 32

D 36

The new versions will have id keywords expanded, and
will not be editable.
The
.Fl m ,
.Fl p ,
.Fl r ,
.Fl s ,
and
.Fl y
flags will be passed to
.Nm delta ,
and the

D 36
.Tp Ic deledit
E 36
I 36
.It Cm deledit
E 36
Equivalent
to
.Nm delget
except that the
.Nm get
phase includes the
.Fl e
flag.
This
option is useful for making a
.Em checkpoint
of your current editing phase.  The same flags will be passed to delta
as described above, and
all the flags listed for
.om get
above except
.Fl e
and
.Fl k
are
passed to
.Nm edit .
D 36
.Tp Ic create
E 36
I 36
.It Cm create
E 36
Creates
an
.Li SCCS
file ,
taking
the initial contents from the file of the same name.
Any
flags to
.Nm admin
are accepted.  If the creation is successful,
E 32
the files are renamed with a comma on the front.
D 32
These should be removed when you are convinced that
the
.SM SCCS
files have been created successfully.

E 36
Must
be followed by a
.Fl r
E 32
flag.
D 32
This command essentially removes the named delta,
but leaves you with a copy of the delta
with the changes that were in it.
It is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, etc.
Since it doesn't leave audit trails,
it should be used carefully.
.IP clean
E 32
I 32
This command essentially removes the named delta, but
leaves you with a copy of the delta
with the changes that were in it.  It
is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, etc.

E 32
D 20
Takes no arguments.
E 20
This routine removes everything from the current directory
that can be recreated from SCCS files.
D 13
It will not remove any files being editted.
E 13
I 13
It will not remove any files being edited.
I 20
If the
D 32
.B \-b
flag is given, branches are ignored in the determination
of whether they are being edited;
this is dangerous if you are keeping the branches in the
E 32
I 32
.Fl b
flag is given, branches are ignored in the determination of
whether they are being edited; this
is dangerous if you are keeping the branches in the
E 32
same directory.
E 20
E 13
I 9
D 32
.IP unedit
This is the opposite of an ``edit''
or a ``get \-e''.
It should be used with extreme caution,
since any changes you made since the get
will be irretrievably lost.
E 9
I 8

I 32
D 36
.Tp Ic unedit

E 36
This

It should be used with extreme caution, since
any changes you made since the get will be irretrievably lost.
D 36
.Tp Ic info
E 36
I 36

E 36
E 32
D 13

E 13
I 13
Gives a listing of all files being edited.
I 20
If the
D 32
.B \-b
flag is given,
branches (i.e.,
\s-1SID\s0's with two or fewer components)
are ignored.
I 21
If the
.B \-u
flag is given
(with an optional argument)
then only files being edited by you
(or the named user)
are listed.
E 21
E 20
E 13
I 12
.IP check
Like ``info''
except that nothing is printed if nothing is being edited,
and a non-zero exit status is returned if anything
is being edited.
The intent is to have this included in an ``install''
entry in a makefile
to insure that everything is included into the
.SM SCCS
file
before a version is installed.
I 19
.IP tell
Gives a newline-separated list
of the files being edited
on the standard output.
I 20
Takes the
.B \-b
E 32
I 32
.Fl b
flag
is given, branches (i.e.,
D 36
.Cx Li SID
.Cx \&\'s
.Cx
E 36
I 36
.Li SID Ns \&\'s 
E 36
with two or fewer components)

only files being edited by you (or the named user) are listed.
D 36
.Tp Ic check

.Li SCCS
file before a version is installed.
D 36
.Tp Ic tell
E 36
I 36
.It Cm tell
E 36
Gives a newline-separated list of the files being edited
on the standard output.  Takes the

E 32
D 21
flag like 
E 21
I 21
and
D 32
.B \-u
flags like 
E 21
``info'' and ``check''.
E 20
E 19
I 17
.IP diffs
Gives a ``diff'' listing between the current version of the
program(s) you have out for editing and the versions
in
.SM SCCS
E 32
I 32
.Fl u
flags like
.Nm info

D 36
.Tp Ic diffs

Gives a

D 22

The intent here is to create aliases such as
D 32
``alias syssccs sccs -d/usr/src''
which will be used as
``syssccs get cmd/who.c''.
I 24
Also, if the environment variable

is set,
its value is used to determine the
.B \-d flag.
If it begins with a slash,
it is taken directly;
otherwise,
the home directory of a user of that name
is examined for a subdirectory ``src'' or ``source''.
If such a directory is found,
it is used.
