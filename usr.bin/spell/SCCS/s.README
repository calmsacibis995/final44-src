Welcome to Webster's Second International, all 234,936 words worth.
The 1934 copyright has elapsed, according to the supplier.  The
supplemental 'web2a' list contains hyphenated terms as well as assorted
noun and adverbial phrases.  The wordlist makes a dandy 'grep' victim.

All files and subdirectories of this directory are recommended for
rdisting except web2 and web2a (because of their size).  Details on
most of these files is described under FILES below.

All files and subdirectories of /usr/share/dict are recommended for

rdisting except web2 and web2a (because of their size), and some of
the files  hlist*  depending on needs of your machine (details below).
Descriptions of most of these files are given under FILES below.

The new subdirectory "special" contains lists of words in specialized
D 4
fields, which may be hashed in with the regular lists on machines
having many users working in these fields.  As of this writing, it
contains two files.
E 4
I 4
fields, which may be hashed in with the regular lists on machines having
many users working in these fields.  As of this writing, there are two
such specialized wordlists.
E 4

It is advised that system managers also create a directory
D 4
/usr/local/dict.  (Such a directory will probably be provided, empty,
in the next release.)  This can be used to maintain files of particular
interest to users of the machine (e.g., surnames of members of the
E 4
I 4
/usr/local/dict. This can be used to maintain files of particular
interest to users of each machine (e.g., surnames of members of the
E 4
department on a departmental machine).

D 4
Here is a script that might be used to customize the hashlists on a
machine to include the words in /usr/dict/special/xxx, as well as two
local lists called /usr/local/dict/surnames and
/usr/local/dict/acronyms.
E 4
I 4
The hashed wordlists hlista and hlistb in this distribution include
the words in the file special/4bsd, comprising current 4bsd
commands, system calls, etc. (from "abs" to "zcat").  Machines
whose primary users are programmers should take these files by
rdist.  For machines with other user populations, a file "hlist" is
provided which only contains the contents of /usr/dict/words.  Managers
of such machines should rdist this file, and use "spellin" to produce
files hlist{a,b} which contain the words from
D 5
/usr/dict/{american,british} respectively, plus any other files
E 5
I 5
/usr/share/dict/{american,british} respectively, plus any other files
E 5
appropriate to the needs of the majority of their users.  (Some basic
unix commands and terms that general users are likely to encounter,
D 5
e.g. troff, emacs, tty, have been included in /usr/dict/words.
E 5
I 5
e.g. troff, emacs, tty, have been included in /usr/share/dict/words.
E 5
More may be added as suggestions are received.)  Here, for instance is a
script that might be used to create the hashlists on a particular
D 5
machine, so as to include the words in /usr/dict/special/math, as well
E 5
I 5
machine, so as to include the words in /usr/share/dict/special/math, as well
E 5
as two local lists which we will assume are called
/usr/local/dict/surnames and /usr/local/dict/acronyms.

The new hashed lists, being named /usr/dict/hlist[ab], become the
default lists for "spell"; the old lists can still be called with the -d
option.
E 4
I 4
     Hashlists can also be created from scratch using
/usr/src/usr.bin/spell/Makefile.  This is now written so that if "make"
is run with no options it will produce the hashed files as presently
distributed, but so that the extra wordlists used can be controlled with
variables LOCAL and SPECIAL.  For instance, the results given by the
above script can be obtained by doing:
E 4

D 4
Wordlists are in general sorted as in sort -df.  This makes no
difference for spell's hashing process, but will make a difference
commands that search them directly (such as "look").
E 4
I 4
	cd /usr/src/usr.bin/spell
	make LOCAL='/usr/local/dict/surnames /usr/local/dict/acronyms' \
		SPECIAL=special.math 
	make install
E 4

I 4
     Returning to the subject of the wordlists in /usr/dict, these are,
in general, ordered as in  sort -df.  This makes no difference for
spell's hashing process, but makes a difference for other commands,
such as "look", that perform binary searches on the unhashed lists.

Complaints, and any additional suggestions for words or wordlists,
should be sent to me.  I cannot fix bugs involving the code of "spell",
but I am maintaining a list of these bugs, and of other ideas for
improvement.
