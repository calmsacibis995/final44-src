.SH DESCRIPTION
D 5
.I Strings
looks for ascii strings in a binary file.
A string is any sequence of 4 or more printing characters ending with
a newline or a null.
Unless the
.B \-
flag is given,
.I strings
only looks in the initialized data space of object files.
If the
.B \-o
flag is given, then each string is preceded by its offset in the
file (in octal).
If the
\fB\-\fInumber\fR
flag is given then number is used as the minimum string length
rather than 4.

\fIStrings\fP looks for ascii strings in each of the specified files,
or from the standard input.  A string is any sequence of 4 or more printing
characters.  Unless the \fB-a\fP flag is given, \fIstrings\fP only looks
in the initialized data space of object files.  If the \fB-o\fP flag is
D 6
given, then each string is preceded by its offset in the file (in
octal).  If the \fB-\fInumber\fR flag is given, then \fInumber\fP is
used as the minimum string length rather than 4.

given, then each string is preceded by its decimal offset in the file.
If the \fB-\fInumber\fR flag is given, then \fInumber\fP is used as the
minimum string length rather than 4.

The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primitive
E 4
I 4
The algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primitive.
I 12
In particular, machine code instructions on certain architectures
can resemble sequences of ASCII bytes, which
will fool the algorithm.
I 13
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historic implementations of
.Nm
only search the initialized data portion of the object file.
This was reasonable as strings were normally stored there.
Given new compiler technology which installs strings in the 
text portion of the object file, the default behavior was
changed.
