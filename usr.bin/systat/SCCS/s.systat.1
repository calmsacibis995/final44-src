list of commands below.
E 3
.PP
Commands to switch between displays may be abbreviated to the
minimum unambiguous prefix; for example, ``io'' for ``iostat''.
Certain information may be discarded when the screen size is
insufficient for display.  For example, on a machine with 10
drives the 
.I iostat
bar graph displays only 3 drives on a 24 line terminal.  When
a bar graph would overflow the allotted screen space it is
truncated and the actual value is printed ``over top'' of the bar.
.PP
The following commands are specific to the 
.I iostat
display; the minimum unambiguous prefix may be supplied.
.IP numbers
Show the disk i/o statistics in numeric form.  Values are
displayed in numeric columns which scroll downward.
.IP bars
Show the disk i/o statistics in bar graph form (default).
.IP msps
Toggle the display of average seek time (the default is to
not display seek times).
D 3
.IP "ignore [ drives ]"
Do not display information about the drives indicated.  Multiple
drives may be specified, separated by spaces.

may be specified, separated by spaces.

The following commands are common to each display which shows
information about disk drives.  These commands are used to
select a set of drives to report on, should your system have
more drives configured than can normally be displayed on the
screen.
.IP "ignore [ drives ]"
Do not display information about the drives indicated.  Multiple
drives may be specified, separated by spaces.
.IP "display [ drives ]"
Display information about the drives indicated.  Multiple drives
may be specified, separated by spaces.

network servers awaiting requests are not displayed.  Each address
is displayed in the format ``host.port'', with each shown symbolically,

.IP "port name"
Limit the display to connections on the specified port (the port
is matched against the port both on the local and the foreign side
of a connection).  A port
.I name
may be specified symbolically, e.g. ``ftp'', or numerically (base 10).
This command may be specified many times to create a set of ports
for matching.
.IP "host name"
Limit the display to connections to or from the specified host.  A
host
.I name
may be specified symbolically or numerically in the Internet dot
notation.  This command may be specified many times to create a set
of hosts for matching.
.IP "protocol name"
Limit the display to connections using the specified protocol (currently
``tcp'' or ``udp'').  The commands
.I tcp
and
.I udp
are shorthands for ``protocol tcp'' and ``protocol udp'', respectively.
