from the end of the input.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tail
D 10
utility copies its input file to the standard output
beginning at a designated place.
The argument
.Ar number
is counted in
units of blocks, characters or lines (default),
according to the appended option suffixes
.Cm b , c
and
.Cm l .
Copying begins at the point in the file indicated by the
.Cm \\*(Pm Ns Ar number
option, where
.Cm + Ns Ar number
is a positive offset relative to the beginning of the file
and
.Cm \&- Ns Ar number
is a negative offset relative to the end of the file or standard
E 10
I 10
utility displays the contents of
.Ar file
or, by default, its standard input, to the standard output.
.Pp
D 11
The display begins at an offset from either the beginning or end
of the input.
Offsets may be specified in terms of bytes, lines or 512-byte blocks.
E 11
I 11
The display begins at a byte, line or 512-byte block location in the
input.
E 11
Numbers having a leading plus (``+'') sign are relative to the beginning
D 11
of the input.
E 11
I 11
of the input, for example,
.Dq -c +2
starts the display at the second
byte of the input.
E 11
Numbers having a leading minus (``-'') sign or no explicit sign are
D 11
relative to the end of the input.
All offsets are 1 based, i.e. ``-c +1'' skips a single byte of the
E 10
input.
I 10
The default offset is ``-n 10'', or 10 lines from the end of the
input.
E 11
I 11
relative to the end of the input, for example,
.Dq -n 2
displays the last two lines of the input.
The default starting location is
.Dq -n 10 ,
or the last 10 lines of the input.

E 10

D 10

.It Cm f
E 8
Specifying
D 8
.B r
causes tail to print lines from the end of the file in reverse order.
The default for
.B r
is to print the entire file this way.
Specifying
.B f
E 8
I 8
.Cm f
E 8
causes
E 10

option causes
E 10
D 8
.I tail
E 8
I 8
.Nm tail
E 8
D 10
to not quit at end of file, but rather wait and try to read repeatedly
in hopes that the file will grow.
D 8
.SH "SEE ALSO"
dd(1)
.SH BUGS
Tails relative to the end of the file
are treasured up in a buffer, and thus 
are limited in length.
.PP
Various kinds of anomalous behavior may happen
with character special files.
E 8
I 8
.It Cm l
The argument
E 10
I 10
to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional
data to be appended to the input.
The
.Fl f
D 12
option is ignored on pipes but not on FIFO's.
E 12

option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.

refers to line.
.It Cm r
Lines are printed from
.Ar file
in reverse order.
The default for
.Ar r
is to print the entire file this way.
E 10
I 10
lines.
.It Fl r
The
.Fl r
option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by line.
Additionally, this option changes the meaning of the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c
and
.Fl n
options.
When the
.Fl r
option is specified, these options specify the number of bytes, lines
or 512-byte blocks to display, instead of the bytes, lines or blocks
from the beginning or end of the input from which to begin the display.
The default for the
.Fl r
option is to display all of the input.
E 10
.El
I 12
.Pp
If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a
header consisting of the string
.Dq ==> XXX <==
where
.Dq XXX
is the name of the file.
E 12
.Pp
The
.Nm tail
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
E 10
.Nm tail
D 10
on binary or special files is unpredictable.
E 10
I 10
utility is expected to be a superset of the POSIX 1003.2
specification.
In particular, the
I 11
.Fl b
and
E 11
.Fl r
D 11
option is an extension to that standard.
E 11
I 11
options are extensions to that standard.
.Pp
The historic command line syntax of
.Nm tail
is supported by this implementation.
The only difference between this implementation and historic versions
of
.Nm tail ,
once the command line syntax translation has been done, is that the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c
and
.Fl n
options modify the
.Fl r
option, i.e. ``-r -c 4'' displays the last 4 characters of the last line
of the input, while the historic tail (using the historic syntax ``-4cr'')
would ignore the
.Fl c
option and display the last 4 lines of the input.
