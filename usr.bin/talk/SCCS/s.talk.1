It doesn't matter from 
which machine the recipient replies, as long as his login-name is
the same.
Once communication is established, the two parties may type 
simultaneously, with their output appearing in separate windows. 
Typing control L will cause the screen to be reprinted, while your 
erase, kill, and word kill characters will work in talk as normal.
To exit,
just type your interrupt character;
.I talk
then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores 
the terminal.
