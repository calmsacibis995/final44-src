.SH DESCRIPTION
D 2
.I Tcopy
is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made about
the tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.
.I Tcopy
with only a source tape specified will print information about the
sizes of records and tape files.  If a destination is specified,
then, a copy will be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the
destination tape will be identical to that used on the source tape.
Copying a tape will yield the same output as if just printing the
sizes.

The \fB-s\fP option allows you to specify a maximum block size.  The \fB-v\fP
option verifies that two tapes are identical.  The \fB-c\fP option does
the copy and then verifies that the two tapes are identical.
