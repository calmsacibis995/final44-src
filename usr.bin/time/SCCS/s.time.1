command
E 4
I 4
[-l] command
E 4
.SH DESCRIPTION
D 4
The
given command is executed; after it is complete,
.I time
prints the elapsed time during the command, the time
spent in the system, and the time spent in execution
of the command.
Times are reported in seconds.
E 4
I 4
The given command is executed; after it is complete, \fItime\fP
prints the elapsed time during the command, the time spent in the
system, and the time spent in execution of the command.  Times are
reported in seconds.  If the \fB-l\fP option is supplied, the
contents of the \fIrusage\fP structure are printed as well.
E 4
.PP
On a PDP-11, the execution time can depend on what kind of memory
D 4
the program happens to land in;
the user time in MOS is often half what it is in core.

E 4
I 4
The times are printed on the diagnostic output stream, ``stderr''.

\fITime\fP is a built-in command to \fIcsh\fP(1), with a much different
syntax.  This command is available as ``/bin/time'' to \fIcsh\fP users.
E 4
.SH BUGS
D 4
Elapsed time is accurate to the second,
while the CPU times are measured
D 2
to the 60th second.
E 2
I 2
to the 100th second.
E 2
Thus the sum of the CPU times can be up to a second larger
than the elapsed time.
.PP
.I Time

.Sh NAME
.Nm time
.Nd time command execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm time
.Op Fl l
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm time
utility
executes and
times
.Ar command
by initiating a timer and passing the
.Ar command
to the
shell.
After the
.Ar command
finishes,
.Nm time
writes to the standard error stream,
(in seconds): 
the total time elapsed,
time consumed by system overhead,
and the time used to execute the
.Ar command
process.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
The contents of the
.Em rusage
structure are printed as well.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr csh 1
has its own and syntactically different builtin version of
.Nm time.
The command described here
is available as
D 7
.Pa /bin/time
E 7
I 7
.Pa /usr/bin/time
E 7
to
.Xr csh
users.
.Sh BUGS
The granularity of seconds on micro processors is crude and
can result in times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by
a second.
