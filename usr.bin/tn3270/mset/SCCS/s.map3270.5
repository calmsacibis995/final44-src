E 6
a mapping must be performed between sequences of keys hit on
a user's (ascii) keyboard, and the keys that are
available on a 3270.  For example, a 3270 has a key labeled
.B EEOF
which erases the contents of the current field from the
location of the cursor to the end.
In order to accomplish this function,
the terminal user and a program emulating a 3270 must
agree on what keys will be typed
to invoke the
.B EEOF
function.
.PP
The requirements for these sequences are:

D 6
The file consists of entries for various terminals.  The first part
of an entry lists the names of the terminals which use that entry.
These names should be the same as in
E 6
I 6
The file consists of entries for various keyboards.  The first part
of an entry lists the names of the keyboards which use that entry.
These names will often be the same as in
E 6
.I /etc/termcap
D 6
(see \fItermcap\fR(5));
note that often the terminals from various termcap entries will all
E 6
I 6
(see
.IR termcap (5));
however, note that often the terminals from various termcap entries will all
E 6
use the same
.I map3270
entry; for example, both 925 and 925vb (for
925 with visual bells) would probably use the same
.I map3270
entry.
I 6
Additionally, there are occasions when the terminal type defines
a window manager, and it will then be necessary to specify a
keyboard name (via the
.B KEYBD
environment variable) as the name of the entry.
E 6
After the names, separated by vertical bars (`|'), comes a left
brace (`{'); the definitions; and, finally, a right brace
(`}').
.PP
D 6
The definitions consist of a reserved keyword (see list below) which
E 6
I 6
Each definition consists of a reserved keyword (see list below) which
E 6
identifies the 3270 function (extended as defined below), followed
by an equal sign (`='), followed by the various ways to generate
this particular function, followed by a semi-colon (`;').
Each way is a sequence of strings of
.I printable
ascii characters enclosed inside single quotes (`\(aa');
D 6
various ways (options) are separated by vertical bars (`|').
E 6
I 6
various ways (alternatives) are separated by vertical bars (`|').
E 6
.PP
Inside the single quotes, a few characters are special.
A caret
(`^') specifies that the next character is
the ``control'' character of whatever the character is.
So, `^a'
represents control-a, ie: hexadecimal 1
(note that `^A' would generate the same code). 
To generate
D 6
.B rubout,
E 6
I 6
.B rubout
(DEL),
E 6
one enters `^?'.
To represent a control character inside a file
requires using the caret to represent a control sequence;
simply typing control-A will not work.
Note: the ctrl-caret sequence
(to generate a hexadecimal 1E)
is represented as `^^' (not `^\e^').
.PP
D 11
In addition to the caret, a letter may be preceeded by a backslash (`\e').
E 11
I 11
In addition to the caret, a letter may be preceded by a backslash (`\e').
E 11
Since this has little effect for most characters,
its use is usually not recommended.
For the case of a single quote (`\(aa'), the backslash
prevents that single quote from terminating the string.
I 6
For the case of a caret (`^'), the backslash prevents
the caret from having its special meaning.
E 6
To have the backslash be part of the string, it is necessary to
place two backslashes ('\e\e') in the file.
.PP
In addition, the following characters are special:
.sp
.nf
.in +0.5i
`\eE'  means an escape character;
`\en'  means newline;
`\et'  means tab;
`\er'  means carriage return.
.in -0.5i
.fi
.sp
I 13
.sp
E 13
It is not necessary for each character in a string
to be enclosed within single quotes.
`\eE\eE\eE' means three escape characters.
.PP
Comments, which may appear anywhere on a line,
begin with a hash mark (`#'), and terminate
at the end of that line.
However, comments cannot begin inside a quoted string;
a hash mark inside a quoted string has no special meaning.
.PP
.SH 3270 KEYS SUPPORTED
The following is the list of 3270 key names that are supported in this file.
Note that some of the keys don't really exist on a 3270.
In particular, the developers of this file have relied
extensively on the work at the Yale University Computer Center with
their 3270 emulator which runs in an IBM Series/1 front end.
The following list corresponds closely to the functions
that the developers of the Yale code offer in their product.
.sp
.B In the following list, the
.B starred ("*")
.B functions are not supported by
.IR tn3270 (1).
An unsupported function will cause
.IR tn3270(1)
D 6
to send a bell sequence to the user's terminal.
E 6
I 6
to send a (possibly visual) bell sequence to the user's terminal.
