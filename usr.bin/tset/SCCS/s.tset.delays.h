**  SYSTEM DEPENDENT TERMINAL DELAY TABLES
**
**	Evans Hall VAX
**
**	This file maintains the correspondence between the delays
**	defined in /etc/termcap and the delay algorithms on a
**	particular system.  For each type of delay, the bits used
**	for that delay must be specified (in XXbits) and a table
**	must be defined giving correspondences between delays and
**	algorithms.  Algorithms which are not fixed delays (such
**	as dependent on current column or line number) must be
**	cludged in some way at this time.
