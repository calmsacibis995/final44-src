.Nm Ul

reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
D 2
and translates occurances of underscores to the sequence
E 2
I 2
and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence
E 2
which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified
by the environment variable

The

option overrides the terminal kind specified in the environment.

.Ev TERM .
E 6
The file
D 6
.I /etc/termcap
E 6
I 6
.Pa /etc/termcap
E 6
is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.
If the terminal is incapable of underlining, but is capable of
a standout mode then that is used instead.
If the terminal can overstrike,
or handles underlining automatically,

degenerates to

If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.
D 6

The
.B \-i
option causes
.I ul
to indicate underlining onto by a separate line containing appropriate
E 6
I 6
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate
E 6
dashes `\-'; this is useful when you want to look at the underlining
which is present in an

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is used:
.Bl -tag -width TERM
.It Ev TERM
The
.Ev TERM
variable is used to relate a tty device
with its device capability description (see
.Xr termcap 5 ) .
.Ev TERM
is set at login time, either by the default terminal type
specified in
.Pa /etc/ttys
or as set during the login process by the user in their
.Pa login
file (see
.Xr setenv 1 ) .

with the text to indicate underlining.  No attempt is made to optimize
