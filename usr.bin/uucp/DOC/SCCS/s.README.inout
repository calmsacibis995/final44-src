We started to use uucp after the dialin lines had been in place for a while.
It would have been very unpopular here to remove one of lines from public use
to let uucp dial out.  The first version of these changes ran here early in
1983.

Having this ability is very useful way to make full use of your modems. For
one thing, I can smile when a neighoring site complains that their one dialer
is tied up from news backed up to one of their neighbors which has been down
for a while and has just come back up. For another thing some of our neighbors
seem to be reachable better by some modems than by others.  For example, I can
only reach rocky2 with a Racal Vadic.  I can only reach akgua, burl, and
sjuvax with a Hayes.  When our 2400 baud modem arrives so I can make special
note of that --- and I don't have to buy two 2400 baud modems to have two-way
2400 baud capability.

The key to this is a program is provided in the file acucntrl.c .  This should
be installed suid to root in the file /usr/lib/uucp/acucntrl .


uucp notes:
The 3rd field of the L-devices file should contain "inout"  for all devices
intended for dialin/out use.  Devices without the "inout" specification will
be used like before: for dialout only.

Good luck.  I want to never go back to reserving modems for dialout.
