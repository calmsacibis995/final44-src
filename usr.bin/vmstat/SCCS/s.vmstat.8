.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Vmstat
D 8
delves into the system and normally reports certain statistics kept about
process, virtual memory, disk, trap and cpu activity.
If given a
.B \-f
argument, it instead reports on the number of
.I forks
E 8
I 8
reports certain kernel statistics kept about process, virtual memory,
disk, trap and cpu activity.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-c
Repeat the display
.I count
times.
I 9
The first display is for the time since a reboot and each subsequent report
is for the time period since the last display.
If no
.I wait
interval is specified, the default is 1 second.
E 9
.TP
\-f
Report on the number
.IR fork (2)
E 8
and
D 8
.I vforks
since system startup and the number of pages of virtual memory involved in each
kind of fork.
If given a
.B \-s
argument, it instead prints the contents
of the
E 8
I 8
.IR vfork (2)
system calls since system startup, and the number of pages of virtual memory
involved in each.
.TP
\-i
Report on the number of interrupts taken by each device since system
startup.
.TP
\-M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core 
instead of the default ``/dev/kmem''.
.TP
\-N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default
``/vmunix''.
.TP
\-m
Report on the usage of kernel dynamic memory listed first by size of
allocation and then by type of usage.
.TP
\-s
Display the contents of the
E 8
.I sum
structure, giving the total number of several kinds of paging related
D 8
events which have occurred since boot.
I 3
If given a
.B \-i
argument, it instead reports on the number of
.I interrupts
taken by each device since system startup.
I 6
If given a
.B \-m
argument, it instead reports on the usage of
kernel dynamic memory listed first by 
.I size
of allocation and then by
.I type
of usage.
E 8
I 8
events which have occurred since system startup.
.TP
\-t
Report on the number of page in and page reclaims since system startup,
and the amount of time required by each.
.TP
\-w
Pause
.I wait
seconds between each display.
I 9
If no repeat
.I count
is specified, the default is infinity.
E 9
D 10
.TP
\-z
Zero out the kernel's
.I sum
structure.
This is a privileged operation.

If none of these options are given,
E 8
I 8
By default,
E 8
.I vmstat
D 2
will report in a (usually) iterative fashion on the virtual memory
activity in the system.
In this case, the optional
E 2
I 2
D 8
will report in the first line a summary of the virtual memory activity 
since the system has been booted.
If
E 2
.I interval
D 2
argument causes
.I vmstat
to report once each
E 2
I 2
is specified, then successive lines are summaries over the last
E 2
.I interval
D 2
seconds;
E 2
I 2
seconds.
E 2
``vmstat 5'' will print what the system is doing every five seconds;
this is a good choice of printing interval since this is how often
some of the statistics are sampled in the system; others vary every
second, running the output for a while will make it apparent which
are recomputed every second.
If a
.I count
is given, the statistics are repeated
.I count
times.
The format fields are:

The command ``vmstat -i 5'' will print what the system is doing every five
seconds; this is a good choice of printing interval since this is how often
some of the statistics are sampled in the system.
Others vary every second and running the output for a while will make it
apparent which are recomputed every second.
