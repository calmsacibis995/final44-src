The heading shows the current time of day, how long the system has been up,

E 11
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue
averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.
E 12
I 12
The first line displays the current time of day, how long the system has
been running, the number of users logged into the system, and the load
averages.
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged
over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

are left off, as are the arguments to commands.

D 8
The notion of the ``current process'' is muddy.
The current algorithm is ``the highest numbered process on
the terminal that is not ignoring interrupts,
or, if there is none, the highest numbered process on the terminal''.
This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs
like the shell and editor,
or when faulty programs running in the background
fork and fail to ignore interrupts.
(In cases where no process can be found,
.I w
prints ``\-''.)
