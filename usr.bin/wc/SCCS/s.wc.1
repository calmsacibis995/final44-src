is specified.
.PP
The
.B \-b
option asks that the time be figured at
the specified baud rate instead of the default 300 baud.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option specifies that pages are
.I pagesize
lines long instead of the default 66.
.PP
The
.B \-u
options asks that the time printed be based on uucp
transmission time, about 90% as fast as normal.
.PP
The
.B \-v

.Sh NAME
.Nm wc
.Nd word, line, and byte count
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wc
.Op Fl clw
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm wc
D 7
utility reads one or more input text files, and, by
default, writes the number of lines, words, and bytes
contained in each input file to the standard output.
If more than one input file is specified,
a line of cumulative count(s) for all named files is output on a
separate line
following the last file count.
.Nm Wc
considers a word to be a maximal string of
characters delimited by white space.
E 7
I 7
utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each
input
.Ar file
(or standard input, by default) to the standard output.
D 9
A line is defined as a string of chacters delimited by a <newline> character,
E 9
I 9
A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a <newline>
character,
E 9
and a word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space
characters.
White space characters are the set of characters for which the
.Xr isspace 3
function returns true.
If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative counts
for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for
the last file.
E 7
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The number of bytes in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.It Fl l
The number of lines in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.It Fl w
The number of words in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.El
.Pp
When an option is specified,
.Nm wc
D 7
only
reports the
information requested by that option. The
default action is equivalent to all the
flags
.Fl clw
having been specified.
E 7
I 7
only reports the information requested by that option.
The default action is equivalent to specifying all of the flags.
E 7
.Pp
D 7
The following operands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar file
A pathname of an input file.
.El
E 7
I 7
If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no
file name is displayed.
E 7
.Pp
D 7
If no file names
are specified, the standard input is used and
a file name is not output. The resulting output is one
line of the requested count(s) with the cumulative sum
of all files read in via standard input.
.Pp
By default, the standard output contains a line for each
input file of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lines	 words	bytes	file_name
.Ed
.Pp
The counts for lines, words and bytes are integers separated
by spaces.
The ordering of the display of the number of lines, words,
and/or bytes is the order in which the options were specified.
.Pp
E 7
The
.Nm wc
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historically, the
.Nm wc
utility was documented to define a word as a ``maximal string of
characters delimited by <space>, <tab> or <newline> characters''.
The implementation, however, didn't handle non-printing characters
correctly so that ``  ^D^E  '' counted as 6 spaces, while ``foo^D^Ebar''
counted as 8 characters.
4BSD systems after 4.3BSD modified the implementation to be consistent
with the documentation.
This implementation defines a ``word'' in terms of the
.Xr isspace 3
function, as required by
.St -p1003.2 .
E 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm wc
function conforms to
.St -p1003.2 .

D 2
The times given do not take into account variable factors
such as system load;
delays due to tab expansion or tty driver delays,
which can be a factor with cu;
or uucp delays such as mail headers, auxillary protocol files, 
or the time taken to initially connect to another site.
