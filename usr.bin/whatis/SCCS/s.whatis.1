Normally \fIwhatis\fP checks in a standard location (/usr/man) for its
database ``whatis''.  This can be changed by supplying a \fIpath\fP (a
la the Bourne shell) with the \fB-M\fP flag.  This search path must be
a colon (``:'') separated list of directories which \fIwhatis\fP will
search for files named ``whatis''.  The path can also be set with the
environmental variable \fIMANPATH\fP.
E 7
I 7
The options are as follows:
D 10
.TP
.I M
Override the list of standard directories where
.I whatis
D 8
searches for its database.
E 8
I 8
searches for its database named ``whatis.db''.
E 10

.Nm whatis

.Dq Pa whatis.db .
E 10
E 8
The supplied
D 10
.I path
must be a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.
This search path may also be set using the environmental variable
.IR MANPATH .
.TP
.I m

.I whatis
D 8
searches for its database.
E 8
I 8
searches for its database named ``whatis.db''.
E 10
I 10
.Ar path
must be a colon
.Dq \&:
separated list of directories.
This search path may also be set using the environment variable
.Ev MANPATH .
