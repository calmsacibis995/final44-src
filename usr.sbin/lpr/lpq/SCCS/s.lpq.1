.B \-P

to specify a particular printer, otherwise the default line printer
is used (or the value of the PRINTER variable in the environment).
If a

All other arguments supplied are
interpreted as user names or job numbers to filter out only those
jobs of interest.
E 4
I 4
sign changes the number of seconds that \fIlpq\fP should sleep inbetween
scans of the queue, from the default, 30, to \fIn\fP.  All other arguments
supplied are interpreted as user names or job numbers to filter out only
those jobs of interest.
