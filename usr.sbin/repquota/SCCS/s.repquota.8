If the \fI-a\fP flag is used,
.I repquota
prints the quotas of all the filesystems listed in
.IR /etc/fstab .

By default both user and group quotas are printed if they exist.
The optional \fI-g\fP flag specifies that only group quotas should be printed.
The optional \fI-u\fP flag specifies that only user quotas should be printed.
Specifying both \fI-g\fP and \fI-u\fP is equivalent to the default.
