Only if I substitute non-space characters for all the spaces. Then I
end up with a queue entry that causes sendmail -q to die. This is the
log message I do get:

Nov 19 01:09:30 bushwire sendmail[1625]: setsender:          ..lots of spaces

I've appended a tar file containing the trivial shell scripts and the
resultant qf that causes sendmail -q to die.

xx	is the script that core dumps on SunOS 4.1.2/sendmail 8.6.4
yy	is the script that produces the qf file that kills sendmail -q
qf	is the queue file generated by yy.


Oh by the way, vi doesn't like the script files coz they have long
lines.
