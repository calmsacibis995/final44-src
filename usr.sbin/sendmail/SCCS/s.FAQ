E 12
I 12
	   sendmail V8?

	2. Do you know, for a fact, that the question is related to an
	   older version of sendmail?

	3. Is the question about a sendmail-like program (e.g., Smail,
	   Zmailer, MMDF, etc...)?

D 15
	4. Is the question about an SMTP Gateway product for a LAN mail

E 15

	If you answered "yes" to the question #1, then this is the
	right place.

	If you answered "yes" to questions #2 or #3, then you should
	seriously consider upgrading to the most recent version of
	sendmail V8.

D 15
	For question #2, If you're going to contiue using an older
E 15
I 15
	For question #2, If you're going to continue using an older
E 15
	version of sendmail, you may not find much help and will
	probably get some responses that amount to "Get V8".
	Otherwise, this is probably the best place to look for
	answers.

	If you answered "yes" to question #3 and are not going to
	upgrade to sendmail V8, then this is probably not the right
	place to look.

	If you answered "yes" to question #4, then this is almost
	certainly not the right place to look.

	For questions #3 and #4, try looking around elsewhere in the
	"comp.mail.*" hierarchy for a more appropriate newsgroup.
	For example, you might want to try posting to comp.mail.misc
	or comp.mail.smail.

	If you couldn't answer "yes" to any of the above questions,
D 15
	then you're DEFINITELY asking in the wrong place.  For the
	sake of your sanity and ego, not to mention avoiding the

  * Where can I find the latest version of this FAQ?

	It is included in the most recent Version 8 distribution of
	sendmail (described below), as well as via anonymous FTP from
	rtfm.mit.edu in /pub/usenet/news.answers/mail/sendmail-faq.
	If you do not have access to anonymous FTP, you can retrieve
	it by sending email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the
	command "send usenet/news.answers/mail/sendmail-faq" in the
	message.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * I don't have access to Usenet news.  Can I still get access to
    comp.mail.sendmail?

	Yes.  Send email to mxt@dl.ac.uk with the command "sub
	comp-news.comp.mail.sendmail <full-US-ordered-email-address>"
	in the message.

	E-mail you want posted on comp.mail.sendmail should be sent
	to comp-mail-sendmail@dl.ac.uk
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * I have sendmail-related DNS questions.  Where should I ask them?

	Depending on how deeply they get into the DNS, they can be
	asked here.  However, you'll probably be told that you should
	send them to the Info-BIND mailing list (if the question is
	specific to that program) or to the Usenet newsgroup
	comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains (DNS in general).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I subscribe to either of these?

	For comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains, you have to be on Usenet.
	They don't have a news-to-mail gateway yet.

	For the Info-BIND mailing list, send email to
	bind-request@uunet.uu.net with the command "subscribe" in the
	message.  Submissions should be sent to bind@uunet.uu.net

	Via anonymous FTP from FTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU in /ucb/sendmail.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
E 4
  * Version 8 requires a new version of "make".  Where can I get this?

	Actually, Version 8 does not require a new version of "make".
	It includes a collection of Makefiles for different architectures,
D 7
	only one or two of which require the new "make".  If you are
	porting to a new architecture, start with Makefile.dist.
E 7
I 7
	only one or two of which require the new "make".  For a supported
	architecture, use ``sh makesendmail''.  If you are porting to a
	new architecture, start with Makefile.dist.
E 7

	If you really do want the new make, it is available on any of
D 4
	the BSD Net2 distribution sites.  These include:
E 4
I 4
	the BSD Net2 or 4.4-Lite distribution sites.  These include:

  * What macro package do I use to format the V8 man pages?

D 11
	The BSD group switched over the the ``mandoc'' macros for
	the 4.4 release.  These include more hooks designed for
	hypertext handling.  However, new man pages won't format
	under the old man macros.  Fortunately, old man pages will
	format under the new mandoc macros.

	The aliases file should generally be owned by one trusted
D 11
		user and writable only by that user, although it

  * How do I make all my addresses appear to be from a single host?

	Using the V8 configuration macros, use:

		MASQUERADE_AS(my.dom.ain)

	This will cause all addresses to be sent out as being from
	the indicated domain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * How do I rewrite my From: lines to read ``First_Last@My.Domain''?

D 11
	There are a couple of ways of doing this.  This describes using
	the "user database" code.  This is still experimental, and was
	intended for a different purpose -- however, it does work
	with a bit of care.  It does require that you have the Berkeley
	"db" package installed (it won't work with DBM).

	Berkeley "db" package installed (it won't work with DBM).
E 11

	First, create your input file.  This should have lines like:

		loginname:mailname	First_Last
		First_Last:maildrop	loginname

	Install it in (say) /etc/userdb.  Create the database:

		makemap btree /etc/userdb.db < /etc/userdb

	You can then create a config file that uses this.  You will
	have to include the following in your .mc file:

		define(confUSERDB_SPEC, /etc/userdb.db)
		FEATURE(notsticky)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * So what was the user database feature intended for?

D 11
	The intent was to have all information for a given user (where
	the user is the unique login name, not an inherently non-unique
	full name) in one place.  This would include phone numbers,
	addresses, and so forth.  The "maildrop" feature is because
	Berkeley does not use a centralized mail server (there are a
	number of reasons for this that are mostly historic), and so
	we need to know where each user gets his or her mail delivered --
	i.e., the mail drop.

E 11

	We are in the process of setting up our environment so that
	mail sent to an unqualified "name" goes to that person's
	preferred maildrop; mail sent to "name@host" goes to that
	host.  The purpose of "FEATURE(notsticky)" is to cause
	"name@host" to be looked up in the user database for delivery
	to the maildrop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Why are you so hostile to using full names for e-mail addresses?

	Because full names are not unique.  For example, the computer
	community has two Andy Tannenbaums and two Peter Deutsches.
D 11
	At one time, Bell Labs had two Stephen R. Bournes with offices
	a few doors apart.  You can create alternative addresses
	(e.g., Stephen_R_Bourne_2), but that's even worse -- which
	one of them has to have their name desecrated in this way?
D 7
	And you can bet that they will get most of the other person's
	email.

	However, for those who want a system that will just sit in

	Unfortunately, there are no known shareware/freeware

D 12
	level of stability necessary to handle that kind of load.  If
	you're wedded to the Intel x86 platform, you need to look at
	commercial implementations of Unix such as Interactive,
	UnixWare, Solaris, or BSDI's 386BSD.  Of the commercial

	Of all known vendor supported versions of Unix for Intel x86,

  * I just upgraded to 8.x and now when my users try to forward their
    mail to a program they get an "illegal shell" message and their

	In order for people to be able to run a program from their
	.forward file, 8.x insists that their shell (that is, the
	shell listed for that user in the passwd entry) be a "valid"
	shell, meaning a shell listed in /etc/shells.  If /etc/shells
	does not exist, a default list is used, typically consisting
	of /bin/sh and /bin/csh.

	This is to support environments that may have NFS-shared
	directories mounted on machines on which users do not have
	login permission.  For example, many people make their
	file server inaccessible for performance or security
	reasons; although users have directories, their shell on
	the server is /usr/local/etc/nologin or some such.  If you
	allowed them to run programs anyway you might as well let
	them log in.

	If you are willing to let users run programs from their
	.forward file even though they cannot telnet or rsh in (as
	might be reasonable if you run smrsh to control the list of
	programs they can run) then add the line

		/SENDMAIL/ANY/SHELL/

	to /etc/shells.  This must be typed exactly as indicated,
	in caps, with the trailing slash.  NOTA BENE:  DO NOT
	list /usr/local/etc/nologin in /etc/shells -- this will
	open up other security problems.

	To test this, set the IDENT timeout to zero using
	``OrIdent=0'' in the configuration file.  This will
	completely disable all use of the IDENT protocol.

	Another possible problem is that you have your name server
D 11
	and/or resolver configured improperly.  Make sure that
	all "nameserver" entries in /etc/resolv.conf point to functional

	You need OSTYPE(systype) in your .mc file -- otherwise the
	configurations use a default that probably disagrees with
	your local mail system.  See cf/README for details.

  * How can I get sendmail to deliver local mail to $HOME/.mail
    instead of into /usr/spool/mail (or /usr/mail)?

	This is a local mailer issue, not a sendmail issue.  Either
	modify your local mailer (source code will be required) or
	change the program called in the "local" mailer configuration
	description to be a new program that does this local delivery.
	I understand that "procmail" works well, although I haven't
	used it myself.

	``It's not a bug, it's a feature.''  This happens when you have
	a "owner-list" alias and you send to "list".  V8 propogates the
	owner information into the envelope sender field (which appears
	as the "From " header on UNIX mail or as the Return-Path: header)
	so that downstream errors are properly returned to the mailing
	list owner instead of to the sender.  In order to make this
	appear as sensible as possible to end users, I recommend making
	the owner point to a "request" address -- for example:

  * I am trying to use MASQUERADE_AS (or the user database) to
    rewrite from addresses, and although it works in the From: header
    line, it doesn't work in the envelope (e.g., the "From " line).

	Believe it or not, this is intentional.  The interpretation
	of the standards by the V8 development group was that this
	was an inappropriate rewriting, and that if the rewriting
	were incorrect at least the envelope would contain a valid
	return address.  Other people have since described scenarios
	where the envelope cannot be correct without this rewriting,
	so 8.7 will have an option to rewrite both header and
	envelope.

  * There are four UUCP mailers listed in the configuration files.
    Which one should I use?

	The choice is partly a matter of local preferences and what is
	running at the other end of your UUCP connection.  Unlike good
	protocols that define what will go over the wire, UUCP uses
	the policy that you should do what is right for the other end;
	if they change, you have to change.  This makes it hard to
	do the right thing, and discourages people from updating their
	software.  In general, if you can avoid UUCP, please do.

	If you can't avoid it, you'll have to find the version that is
	closest to what the other end accepts.  Following is a summary
	of the UUCP mailers available.

	uucp-old (obsolete name: "uucp")
	  This is the oldest, the worst (but the closest to UUCP) way of
	  sending messages accros UUCP connections.  It does bangify
	  everything and prepends $U (your UUCP name) to the sender's
	  address (which can already be a bang path itself).  It can
	  only send to one address at a time, so it spends a lot of
	  time copying duplicates of messages.  Avoid this if at all
	  possible.

	uucp-new (obsolete name: "suucp")
	  The same as above, except that it assumes that in one rmail
	  command you can specify several recipients.  It still has a
	  lot of other problems.

	uucp-dom
	  This UUCP mailer keeps everything as domain addresses.
	  Basically, it uses the SMTP mailer rewriting rules.

	  Unfortunately, a lot of UUCP mailer transport agents require
	  bangified addresses in the envelope, although you can use
	  domain-based addresses in the message header.  (The envelope
	  shows up as the From_ line on UNIX mail.)  So....

	uucp-uudom
	  This is a cross between uucp-new (for the envelope addresses)
	  and uucp-dom (for the header addresses).  It bangifies the
	  envelope sender (From_ line in messages) without adding the
	  local hostname, unless there is no host name on the address
	  at all (e.g., "wolf") or the host component is a UUCP host name
	  instead of a domain name ("somehost!wolf" instead of
	  "some.dom.ain!wolf").

	Examples:

	We are on host grasp.insa-lyon.fr (UUCP host name "grasp").  The
	following summarizes the sender rewriting for various mailers.

	Mailer          sender		rewriting in the envelope
	------		------		-------------------------
	uucp-{old,new}	wolf		grasp!wolf
	uucp-dom	wolf		wolf@grasp.insa-lyon.fr
	uucp-uudom	wolf		grasp.insa-lyon.fr!wolf

	uucp-{old,new}	wolf@fr.net	grasp!fr.net!wolf
	uucp-dom	wolf@fr.net	wolf@fr.net
	uucp-uudom	wolf@fr.net	fr.net!wolf

	uucp-{old,new}	somehost!wolf	grasp!somehost!wolf
	uucp-dom	somehost!wolf	somehost!wolf@grasp.insa-lyon.fr
	uucp-uudom	somehost!wolf	grasp.insa-lyon.fr!somehost!wolf

  * I'm trying to to get my mail to go into queue only mode, and it
    delivers the mail interactively anyway.  (Or, I'm trying to use
    the "don't deliver to expensive mailer" flag, and it doesn't
    delivers the mail interactively anyway.)  I can see it does it:
    here's the output of "sendmail -v foo@somehost" (or Mail -v or
    equivalent).

	The -v flag to sendmail (which is implied by the -v flag to
	Mail and other programs in that family) tells sendmail to
	watch the transaction.  Since you have explicitly asked to
	see what's going on, it assumes that you do not want to to
	auto-queue, and turns that feature off.  Remove the -v flag
	and use a "tail -f" of the log instead to see what's going on.

	If you are trying to use the "don't deliver to expensive mailer"
	flag (mailer flag "e"), be sure you also turn on global option
	"c" -- otherwise it ignores the mailer flag.

	compromise security.  When sendmail sees this it gives up
