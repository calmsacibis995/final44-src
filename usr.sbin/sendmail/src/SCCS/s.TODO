-- get rid of MAXMAILERS, just allocate them as you go; merge the stats
	structure in with the MAILERS structure; change the longs in
	said structure into u_longs; print the file in ASCII, lock the
	file before reading/printing.

-- clean up sysexits; get rid of EX_BASE, most of sysexits.c is duplicated
	in deliver.c

-- mailq; split it out, by default, just # of messages, also add sort
	by machine?

 ******	Finish properly implementing SMTP:
	- check correct name in HELO exchange (?)

  ***** Add an accounting package.  [acct.c]

  *****	When processing the queue, batch messages on the basis of
	receiving host rather than message -- so that if connections
	are expensive to complete, we get the most for our money.
	Unfortunately, this is a major change, and will probably
	wait for the next version.

   ****	Put in some more performance hooks.

    *** Integrate a null name server for future hackers.  [names.c]

    *** Have "Operating System Error" give more info (e.g.,
	"cannot fork").  [It really seems like this is ok now -- but
	this is an old delivermail gripe -- check it out more?]

     ** Per-mailer timeouts.  Invalidates old .cf files.

     ** Be able to generate a "response" (edit headers, etc.)
	given a message to respond to.

      * Have VRFY act as a limited name server (?).

      * Implement SEND and related commands in SMTP.

      * Extend full name matching.  This should actually be done in a
	complete name server.  Should the name server be integrated
	into sendmail (via a portal?) or should I "assume" that it
	has been called by the time I am called?

	- Actually, UDB searching and |, /, and :include: mapping should

	  reasons.)
	- Need for $@host part of triple and Return-Receipt-To: processing

I 24
X ****	Run time configurable locking -- e.g., compile in HASFLOCK and
	HASLOCKF, and then choose at runtime between these.

I 30
B ****	Aliases with .REDIRECT fail during newaliases if the "n" flag
	is given.  Problem is, sometimes you want them to, sometimes

B ****	Calls to gethostbyname with a trailing dot fail if you are
	not running DNS.

E 30
I 25
D 43
E ****	Move delivery forking from sendenvelope to sendall so that
	the connection cache works between split envelopes, and to
	avoid a flurry of processes should you be sending to lots of
	sub-lists.

E 43
X ****	Add uucp-bang mailer that strips off any domain name from
	the envelope recipient address first; this is for use in
	mailer table entries.

I 27
X ****	"quote" map (inverse of dequote).  Lets you turn node::user
	into "node::user"@DECNET.gateway

I 50
E ****	Change userdb code to use underlying maps, at least for

E 38
I 38
D 41

I 39

E 41
D 43

E 41

E 43

	drl@vuse.vanderbilt.edu (David R. Linn).

E 33

	timeout on connections regardless of whether they are active
	or not.  For single threaded servers such as Microsoft SMTP
	gateway.  Douglas Anderson <dlander@afterlife.ncsc.mil>.

E 32
E 28
D 47
X ***	Mailer flag that does a "ping" equivalent -- if it fails, wait
	30 seconds and try again (for dialup PPP connections).  Could
	just try the connection and then immediately retry on some
	kinds of failures.

E 47
E 27

	josh@osiris.ac.hmc.edu).

	non-local names can be forwarded to another site.  [8.8]
E 43
I 24

E ***	Have daemons that start up check the alias database for
	correctness and auto-rebuild if necessary.  This is to handle
	the case of a system crash during an alias database rebuild.

E ***	Eliminate E qf line and e_errorqueue; use e_errorsto a la
	e_receiptto.  This simplifies and gives symmetry.  (Eric
	Wassenaar)

E ***	Move mailertable lookup after UUCP-specific class checks?
	(Kimmo Suominen <kim@tac.nyc.ny.us>)

E ***	Users in more than one list with different owners get duplicate
	deliveries -- maybe just assign them arbitrarily to one
	envelope or the other?

I 49
E ***	Mailer flag to turn off MX lookups.
I 54

E **	Hooks for "mail status daemon" -- send dgrams to a WKS that will
	announce when jobs are created/destroyed.  Someone needs to write
	the daemon though....

X **	Mailer timeout (to handle things like local mailers that hang).
	Perhaps a per-mailer value?
E 54

I 53

	addresses to check compatibility.  Can you do enough interesting
	things with this?

E 45
X **	Make MAXBADCOMMANDS run time configurable.

E **	Allow mailertable entries of the form ``error:message''.

X **	Have .forward files re-queue if the home directory isn't

	(Q.G.Campbell@newcastle.ac.uk)

E **	Have nullclient configuration resolve local names to the local
	mailer and then redirect them in ruleset 5; this allows you to
	redirect root differently depending on the client.  It's not
	clear this is really a good idea though.

E 37
E **	Move CurHostAddr into mci struct, and make CurMCI variable
	point to this, so that logging will give the correct address
	instead of (0) for cached connections.  Motonori Nakamura.
E 36

I 34

E 47
E 27
E 26

	<peter@cc.gatech.edu>).  Merge with suggestions to use
	MIME-format for 8-bit characters?

E **	Save address information that comes back as the "additional
	records" part of an MX lookup, to avoid additional name server
	attempts.  If there is an MX record without an additional A
	record, delete it (this avoids a problem with misconfigured
	DNS situations).

X **	Allow a way to extend the $Z macro with local configuration
	information.

E 25
I 23
X **	Allow $x in -bt mode to expand macro "x".  (BCX)  [8.8]

	aliases, etc. and display results.  [8.8]

X **	"R mailer address" in -bt mode does remotename on address.

E **	Adjust "infinite loop in rule" code to handle entire ruleset
	(Code from Michael Corrigan).

E 23
E **	Allow :include: from command line (not SMTP) to assist in
	"personal list" management -- i.e., creating lists that
	cannot be EXPNed.

E 47
I 30
X **	Some way to diddle resolver flags on a per-lookup basis, such

	inappropriate times.  (Christophe Wolfhugel)

	  (this is the workaround)
E 47

	[Bob Henry]

B *	EXPN adds @localhost instead of @$M.  [Pel Emanuelsson]

	make the timeout algorithm more responsive and more resilient.
	Unfortunately, it's also a pain in the butt.

X *	Some way to relay unfound local users to another site.

X *	Disable all default RW sets except mailer-specific?
