MAN.	Limit of 30 hosts should be doc'ed.

****	It should be dynamically allocated with no limit.  On a large network,
	one host could possibly master over many more than 30 hosts.  That will
	partly depend upon how the multi-network code gets implemented, but the
	dynamic allocation can be used anyway.

UGLY,CODE. timedc/cmds.c has a lots of repeated code in it.

****	I haven't looked at the code, but if you want to work it over, be my
	guest.  The first thing I seem to remember is that each command is set
	up as if it were an individual program taking argc and argv.  A more
	conventional calling style should be used.  I don't think any of the
	routines take more than a couple arguments.

UGLY.	fxn definition syntax does't follow convention:
	has type on same line.

****	I agree that it needs to be fixed at least enough that tags
	will work on it.  An entire cleanup might be nice later, but
	is noncritical.

LOBBY(mildly),CODE:	Would be very convenient if date(1) took a
	+-<number> argument to set the time relatively.  With
	the advent of timed it is now reasonable to synchronize
	with WWV, which is nearly impossible to do "by hand"
	with just an absolute date, and scripts are too slow.
	format could be +-nn...nn.ss, where the '.' is required
	to remove ambiguity.

****	If you want to do it go ahead.  It sounds useful.  As far as
	syntax goes, the normal format for the date should work just
	fine for this.  If the date is preceeded by a plus or minus,
	the change is relative, otherwise it is absolute.
		
CONF,not in nbsd.	Makefile for m68000 doesn't work right: two modules,
			not one, and named wrong.

****	Low priority.  This is a VAX distribution right now, so I'm not
	too concerned about minor configuration problems with m68000 code.
	We might try to get it fixed before the final tape.  I won't even
	look at it before the beta tape.
