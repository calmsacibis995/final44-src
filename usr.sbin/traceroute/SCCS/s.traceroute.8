E 4
The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of
network hardware, connected together by gateways.
Tracking the route one's packets follow (or finding the miscreant
gateway that's discarding your packets) can be difficult.

The only mandatory parameter is the destination host name or IP number.
The default probe datagram length is 38 bytes, but this may be increased
by specifying a packet size (in bytes) after the destination host
name.

to pick an unused port range.

Set the number of probes per ``ttl'' to

Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly-attached network,
an error is returned.
This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it (e.g., after the interface was dropped by
D 4
.IR routed (8C)).
.TP
.B \-s
Use the following IP address (which must be given as an IP number, not
E 4
I 4
.Xr routed 8 ) .
.It Fl s Ar src_addr
Use the following IP address
(which must be given as an IP number, not
E 4
a hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets.  On
hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to
force the source address to be something other than the IP address
of the interface the probe packet is sent on.  If the IP address
is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is
returned and nothing is sent.

Note that lines 2 & 3 are the same.  This is due to a buggy
kernel on the 2nd hop system \- lbl-csam.arpa \- that forwards
packets with a zero ttl (a bug in the distributed version
D 4
of 4.3BSD).  Note that you have to guess what path
the packets are taking cross-country since the NSFNet (129.140)

Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final
destination) and exactly the last half of them are "missing".
What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)
is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its
D 4
ICMP reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path
(with no notice sent to anyone since ICMP's aren't sent for
ICMP's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path

reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path

until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path
E 4

returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.
