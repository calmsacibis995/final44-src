The recommended use of

.I trsp
E 4
I 4
.Nm trsp
E 4
is as follows.
Isolate the problem and enable debugging on the
socket(s) involved in the connection.
Find the address of the protocol control blocks
associated with the sockets using the 
D 4
.B \-A
E 4
I 4
.Fl A
E 4
option to 
D 4
.IR netstat (1).
E 4
I 4
.Xr netstat 1 .
E 4
Then run
D 4
.I trsp
E 4
I 4
.Nm trsp
E 4
with the
D 4
.B \-p
E 4
I 4
.Fl p
E 4
option, supplying the associated
protocol control block addresses.  If there are
many sockets using the debugging option, the
D 4
.B \-j
E 4
I 4
.Fl j
E 4
option may be useful in checking to see if
any trace records are present for the socket in
question.
